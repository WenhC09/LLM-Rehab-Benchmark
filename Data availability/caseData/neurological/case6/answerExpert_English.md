# 1. Rehabilitation Goals

*   **Short-term Goals:**
    *   Improve the patient's standing balance to achieve Balance Scale Grade 3 and enable independent transfer from bed to wheelchair.
    *   Regarding cognitive function: restore accurate orientation to time, place, and person; enable recall of the content of the previous meal; and enable completion of simple calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) within 10.
    *   For Activities of Daily Living (ADL): achieve a Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score above 60 and enable independent, correct telephone dialing using a contact list.
*   **Long-term Goals:**
    *   Restore the patient's ability for independent ambulation within the community.
    *   Restore cognitive function to a basically normal level commensurate with the patient's identity.
    *   Ultimately achieve complete independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL).

# 2. Treatment Methods

The patient's rehabilitation strategy is a comprehensive treatment plan integrating multiple modern and traditional rehabilitation approaches, detailed as follows:

*   **Computer-Assisted Cognitive Training:**
    Administered by a professional therapist using a cognitive rehabilitation system for targeted training of executive functions. Training content primarily includes:
    1.  **Working Memory Training:** Includes element memorization tasks, keep-track tasks, and dot counting tasks, focusing on training short-term memory and processing of visuospatial information by presenting common real-life object graphics.
    2.  **Inhibitory Control Training:** Includes response inhibition training (e.g., press key 2 when seeing number 1, click sad face when seeing smiling face), antisaccade training, Flanker task training, and stop-signal reaction time training, aimed at enhancing the ability to suppress irrelevant information and impulsive behaviors.
    3.  **Set-Shifting Training:** Trains the ability to flexibly switch between different task rules using number switching tasks and category switching tasks to improve cognitive rigidity.
    4.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training Module.**

*   **Motor Function Training:**
    1.  **Balance and Gait Training:** Includes weight-bearing training on the affected (left) lower limb, step-up/down training to enhance standing balance, and ambulation training within parallel bars to improve gait.
    2.  **Muscle Strength and Endurance Training:** One-on-one resistance training by a physical therapist targeting shoulder flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, external rotation, and internal rotation. Resistance training is performed using 500g weights at 30 Repetition Maximum (30RM). Simultaneously, a rehabilitation cycle ergometer is used for lower limb muscle strengthening.

*   **Occupational Therapy:**
    Primarily focuses on specialized training for Activities of Daily Living (ADL), including instructing and assisting the patient in actively performing specific activities such as feeding, personal hygiene, dressing, bathing, and toileting to enhance practical life skills.

*   **Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS):**
    Utilizes a low-frequency (1Hz) stimulation protocol targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). An "8"-shaped coil is used, with the coil center placed tangentially and snug against the scalp, the handle positioned at a 45-degree angle to the midline. Stimulation intensity is set at 80% of the resting motor threshold (RMT), aiming to modulate cortical activity related to executive functions.

*   **Traditional Acupuncture Therapy:**
    Employing the "Governor Vessel Regulation and Spirit Regulation" acupuncture method. Primary acupoints: Baihui (GV20), Shenting (GV24), Yintang (EX-HN3), Shuigou (GV26), Fengchi (GB20). Supplementary acupoints: Taichong (LR3), Taixi (KI3), Neiguan (PC6), Fenglong (ST40), Sanyinjiao (SP6). Needles are retained for 30 minutes after achieving de qi sensation. Treatment is administered once daily, 5 times per week, for a total course of 4 weeks.

*   **Conventional Pharmacotherapy and Health Education:**
    Administering Aspirin, Clopidogrel, and Statins for secondary stroke prevention. Concurrently, providing health education to the patient and their family, covering precautions and assistance techniques for daily life details such as eating, washing, and grooming.
