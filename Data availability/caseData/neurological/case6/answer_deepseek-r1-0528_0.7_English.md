# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2-4 weeks):
*   Achieve independent bed-to-chair transfers with supervision
*   Improve standing balance to Level III (moderate support)
*   Increase MBI score to 60 (moderate assistance required)
*   Complete 1-step commands with 80% accuracy
*   Reduce non-perseverative errors on WCST by 30%
*   Establish safe swallowing protocol
*   Educate family on home safety modifications

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
*   Achieve independent household ambulation with single-point cane
*   Negotiate home stairs with standby supervision
*   Reach MBI ≥75 (minimal assistance for ADLs)
*   Execute 3-step commands with 70% accuracy
*   Improve WCST categories completed to ≥3
*   Develop compensatory strategies for executive dysfunction
*   Enable independent medication management

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Motor Rehabilitation
*   **Task-Specific Training**:  
    - Upper limb: Reach-grasp-release exercises with weighted cups (3x10 reps)  
    - Lower limb: Sit-to-stand transitions (5 sets, 8 reps) with height progression  
*   **Balance Training**:  
    - Static: Tandem stance with parallel bar support (3x60s)  
    - Dynamic: Weight shifts during ball catching (2x15min)  
*   **Gait Training**:  
    - Partial body-weight support treadmill training (15min, 0.8m/s)  
    - Overground walking with hemi-walker (2x25m)  
*   **Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy**:  
    - Right arm restraint during mealtime activities (90min/day)  

### Cognitive Rehabilitation
*   **Executive Function Training**:  
    - Card sorting tasks with decreasing cues (2x20min)  
    - Medication management simulation with pill organizer  
*   **Attention Training**:  
    - Cancellation tasks with dual-component stimuli (3x10min)  
*   **Memory Compensation**:  
    - Spaced retrieval training for daily schedule recall  
    - External aid implementation (memory notebook training)  
*   **Visuospatial Training**:  
    - Block design tasks with graded complexity  

### ADL Training
*   **Task Analysis Approach**:  
    - Dressing training using backward chaining technique  
    - Toileting simulation with grab bar installation  
*   **Energy Conservation**:  
    - Pacing strategies during meal preparation  
*   **Home Environment Simulation**:  
    - Stair negotiation training on rehabilitation staircase (2x8 steps)  

### Adjunctive Therapies
*   **Physiotherapy Modalities**:  
    - Functional electrical stimulation for tibialis anterior during swing phase  
*   **Swallowing Management**:  
    - Clinical swallowing evaluation + videofluoroscopy if indicated  
*   **Lifestyle Intervention**:  
    - Smoking cessation counseling (motivational interviewing)  
    - Alcohol reduction plan with family involvement  
*   **Psychoeducation**:  
    - Errorless learning principles for caregivers  
    - Home safety workshop (fall prevention, bathroom modifications)  

### Monitoring Parameters
*   Weekly MBI reassessment  
*   Biweekly Berg Balance Scale tracking  
*   Monthly repeat WCST and MoCA  
*   Daily exercise adherence logs  
*   Blood pressure monitoring pre/post therapy
