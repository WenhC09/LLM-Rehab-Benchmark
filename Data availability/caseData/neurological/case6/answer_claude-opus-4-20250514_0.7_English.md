# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Improve left upper and lower limb muscle strength from Grade IV to Grade V.
- Enhance standing balance from Level II to Level III.
- Increase Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score from 45 points to 60 points within 4 weeks.
- Improve cognitive function as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score from 18 to 22 within 4 weeks.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) as indicated by a Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score of 80 points or higher within 3 months.
- Improve cognitive function to a level where the patient can perform basic executive tasks and enhance problem-solving skills, aiming for a total score of 24 or higher on the MoCA within 3 months.
- Facilitate social participation and reintegration into community activities within 6 months.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### Physical Rehabilitation:
- **Strength Training**: Implement a progressive resistance training program focusing on the left upper and lower limbs, utilizing weights and resistance bands to enhance muscle strength.
- **Balance Training**: Incorporate balance exercises such as standing on one leg, tandem walking, and use of balance boards to improve standing balance.
- **Gait Training**: Utilize parallel bars and assistive devices (if necessary) to practice walking and improve gait mechanics.

### Occupational Therapy:
- **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training**: Engage the patient in tasks such as dressing, grooming, and meal preparation to promote independence.
- **Fine Motor Skills Training**: Use therapeutic activities that require hand coordination, such as buttoning shirts or using utensils, to improve hand function.

### Cognitive Rehabilitation:
- **Cognitive Exercises**: Implement structured cognitive training exercises focusing on memory, attention, and executive function, including puzzles, memory games, and problem-solving tasks.
- **Functional Cognitive Tasks**: Incorporate real-life scenarios into therapy sessions to practice cognitive skills in context, such as planning a grocery list or following a recipe.

### Multidisciplinary Approach:
- **Regular Team Meetings**: Conduct weekly meetings with the rehabilitation team (physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and neuropsychologists) to assess progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.
- **Family Involvement**: Educate and involve family members in the rehabilitation process to support the patientâ€™s recovery and encourage practice of skills at home.

### Monitoring and Evaluation:
- **Regular Assessments**: Schedule bi-weekly assessments to monitor progress in strength, balance, cognitive function, and ADL performance.
- **Adjust Treatment Plan**: Modify the rehabilitation plan based on the patient's progress and feedback, ensuring that goals remain realistic and achievable.
