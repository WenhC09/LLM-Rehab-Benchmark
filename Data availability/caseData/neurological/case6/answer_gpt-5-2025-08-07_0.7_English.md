# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2–4 weeks)
- Improve left upper and lower limb muscle strength from Grade IV to near-normal (Grade V-) to support independent transfers and basic ambulation.
- Enhance standing balance from Level 2 to Level 3 or above to reduce fall risk.
- Increase Modified Barthel Index (MBI) from 45 to ≥60 to enable greater independence in basic ADLs (e.g., dressing, grooming, toileting).
- Improve attention, orientation, and executive function as reflected by improved performance in structured cognitive tasks (e.g., MMSE increase by ≥3 points, MoCA increase by ≥3 points).
- Educate patient and spouse on home safety strategies and stroke secondary prevention.

### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
- Achieve independent ambulation indoors and on stairs (with use of handrail as needed), enabling access to the 2nd-floor home.
- Attain MBI ≥90, enabling independence in most ADLs without supervision.
- Restore upper limb dexterity sufficient for fine motor tasks (e.g., buttoning, utensil use).
- Improve cognitive function to near premorbid baseline, allowing safe and independent community participation and management of personal affairs.
- Achieve safe reintegration into social activities, minimizing caregiver burden.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 Physical Therapy (PT)
- **Lower limb strengthening**: Progressive resistive exercises for left quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals, and calf muscles (therabands, ankle weights as tolerated).
- **Gait training**: Parallel bars → walker/cane-assisted ambulation → stair training with emphasis on safety and proper sequencing.
- **Balance training**: Static and dynamic balance on stable and compliant surfaces, weight-shifting exercises, stepping strategies.
- **Functional mobility**: Sit-to-stand practice, bed mobility training, transfer techniques.
- **Cardiovascular endurance**: Low-intensity cycle ergometer or treadmill walking (monitor vital signs).

### 2.2 Occupational Therapy (OT)
- **ADL retraining**: Dressing, grooming, feeding, toileting with adaptive strategies.
- **Upper limb function**: Task-oriented therapy for left arm and hand; fine motor coordination activities (e.g., pegboards, putty exercises, coin manipulation).
- **Bilateral integration tasks**: Activities requiring coordinated use of both hands to promote functional symmetry.
- **Home environment simulation**: Practice on mock staircases, kitchen tasks, and bathroom transfers to prepare for home discharge.

### 2.3 Cognitive Rehabilitation
- **Attention training**: Sustained, selective, and divided attention exercises (computer-assisted programs, paper-and-pencil tasks).
- **Executive function**: Problem-solving, sequencing, and planning tasks; role-play daily scenarios.
- **Memory strategies**: Use of mnemonics, visual cues, and written reminders.
- **Visuospatial training**: Constructional tasks, puzzles, and navigation exercises in controlled environments.

### 2.4 Speech and Language Therapy (if indicated)
- Though speech is generally fluent, monitor for subtle language deficits; provide therapy for comprehension, naming, and repetition as needed.
- Teach communication strategies to reduce frustration during executive dysfunction episodes.

### 2.5 Neuropsychological Support
- Regular counseling to address emotional adjustment, frustration, or depression secondary to stroke.
- Education for both patient and spouse on stroke recovery expectations and coping mechanisms.

### 2.6 Patient and Family Education
- Stroke risk factor management: smoking cessation, alcohol reduction, maintaining healthy weight, diet modification.
- Education on recognizing stroke warning signs and emergency response.
- Home safety: Remove tripping hazards, install railings, ensure adequate lighting.

### 2.7 Assistive Devices
- Temporary use of cane or walker for gait stability.
- Adaptive utensils or dressing aids if fine motor recovery is delayed.

### 2.8 Therapy Schedule
- **Inpatient/Intensive rehab phase**: PT and OT each 45–60 min/day, 5–6 days/week; cognitive therapy 30–45 min/day, 3–5 days/week.
- **Home exercise program**: Daily prescribed exercises with caregiver supervision.

### 2.9 Progress Monitoring
- Reassess motor function (manual muscle testing, balance scale) every 2 weeks.
- Reassess ADL independence (MBI) monthly.
- Reassess cognitive status (MMSE, MoCA) every 4–6 weeks.
- Adjust program based on recovery pace and patient tolerance.
