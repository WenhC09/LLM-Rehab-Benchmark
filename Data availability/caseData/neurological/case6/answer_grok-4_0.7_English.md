# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks):
- Improve left limb muscle strength to Grade 5 for upper and lower limbs.
- Enhance standing balance to Level 3 or higher to support safe ambulation.
- Increase Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score to 60 or above to improve independence in basic activities of daily living (ADL).
- Improve cognitive function, targeting a 3–5 point increase in MMSE and MoCA scores, with focus on attention, executive function, and memory.
- Reduce environmental barriers for safe mobility within the home.

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
- Achieve full functional independence in ADL (MBI score ≥85).
- Restore left limb motor function to near-normal for daily tasks and social participation.
- Improve cognitive function to MMSE score ≥24 and MoCA score ≥22, enabling better social interaction and decision-making.
- Enable safe navigation of home environment, including stair climbing, to support community reintegration.
- Enhance social participation through improved mobility and cognitive capacity for leisure and community activities.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy (PT):
- **Frequency**: 5 sessions/week, 45–60 minutes/session.
- **Interventions**:
  - **Strength Training**: Progressive resistance exercises for left upper and lower limbs (e.g., elastic band exercises, light weights) to improve muscle strength from Grade 4 to 5. Focus on shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle movements.
  - **Balance Training**: Standing balance exercises (e.g., weight shifting, single-leg stance with support) to progress from Level 2 to 3. Use of parallel bars or assistive devices as needed.
  - **Gait Training**: Assisted walking with a cane or walker to improve coordination and weight-bearing on the left side. Progress to unassisted walking as balance improves.
  - **Functional Task Training**: Practice ADL tasks (e.g., dressing, transfers) to enhance motor control and independence.
  - **Neuromuscular Facilitation**: Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) techniques to enhance left limb motor recovery (Brunnstrom Stage IV progression).

### Occupational Therapy (OT):
- **Frequency**: 4 sessions/week, 45 minutes/session.
- **Interventions**:
  - **ADL Training**: Task-specific training for self-care activities (e.g., eating, grooming, dressing) to improve MBI score. Use adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled tools) as needed.
  - **Upper Limb Functional Training**: Fine motor tasks (e.g., buttoning, grasping objects) to improve hand dexterity and coordination (Brunnstrom Stage IV, Hand IV).
  - **Environmental Modifications**: Home assessment to recommend adaptations (e.g., grab bars, stair handrails) to facilitate safe mobility in the 2nd-floor apartment.
  - **Cognitive-Motor Integration**: Dual-task training combining motor activities with cognitive tasks (e.g., sorting objects while walking) to address executive dysfunction.

### Cognitive Rehabilitation:
- **Frequency**: 3 sessions/week, 30–45 minutes/session.
- **Interventions**:
  - **Attention Training**: Computer-based attention exercises (e.g., sustained attention tasks) to improve MoCA attention score (currently 1/6) and MMSE attention/calculation (2/5).
  - **Executive Function Training**: Structured tasks like Wisconsin Card Sorting Test-based exercises to improve problem-solving and cognitive flexibility (targeting WCST categories completed and error reduction).
  - **Memory Training**: Spaced retrieval techniques and mnemonic strategies to enhance recall (MoCA delayed recall 1/5, MMSE recall 2/3).
  - **Orientation Training**: Repetitive spatial orientation exercises (e.g., map reading, route planning) to address impaired spatial orientation (MoCA orientation 4/6).
  - **Group Therapy**: Social cognitive group activities to improve logical reasoning and social interaction skills.

### Speech and Language Therapy:
- **Frequency**: 2 sessions/week, 30 minutes/session.
- **Interventions**:
  - **Language Training**: Exercises to improve repetition and three-stage command performance (MMSE repetition 1/1, three-stage command 1/3) through verbal and written tasks.
  - **Cognitive-Communication Training**: Practice structured conversation to address irrelevant responses and improve logical reasoning.
  - **Writing and Constructional Praxis**: Task-specific training (e.g., copying shapes, writing sentences) to improve MMSE writing (0/1) and constructional praxis (0/1).

### Lifestyle and Risk Factor Management:
- **Smoking Cessation**: Referral to smoking cessation program to address 40-year smoking history (30 cigarettes/day). Provide education on stroke risk reduction.
- **Alcohol Reduction**: Counseling to reduce alcohol intake (200 mL/day) to within safe limits (<100 mL/day) to support cardiovascular health.
- **Blood Pressure Monitoring**: Regular BP checks to maintain control (current 140/80 mmHg) and prevent secondary stroke. Coordinate with primary care for medication if needed.
- **Nutrition Counseling**: Dietitian referral for heart-healthy diet to manage weight (BMI 27.8, overweight) and reduce stroke risk.

### Psychosocial Support:
- **Frequency**: 1 session/week, 30 minutes/session.
- **Interventions**:
  - **Counseling**: Individual sessions to address emotional adjustment to impaired ADL and social participation, focusing on coping strategies.
  - **Family Education**: Train spouse on supporting patient’s rehabilitation, safety during transfers, and home modifications.
  - **Community Reintegration**: Plan for gradual return to social activities (e.g., community center visits) as mobility and cognition improve.

### Assistive Devices and Home Modifications:
- **Devices**: Provide a quad cane for ambulation support and a reacher for ADL tasks.
- **Home Modifications**: Recommend installation of stair handrails and bathroom grab bars to ensure safe navigation in the 2nd-floor apartment without elevator access.

### Monitoring and Follow-Up:
- **Assessment Schedule**: Re-evaluate motor function (muscle strength, balance, MBI) and cognitive function (MMSE, MoCA, WCST) every 4 weeks to track progress and adjust plan.
- **Interdisciplinary Team**: Weekly meetings with PT, OT, speech therapist, and psychologist to ensure coordinated care and goal alignment.
- **Discharge Planning**: Prepare for transition to outpatient or home-based rehabilitation once short-term goals are met, with focus on sustaining long-term gains.
