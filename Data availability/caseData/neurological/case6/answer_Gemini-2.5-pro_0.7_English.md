# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-term goals (within 4 weeks):
*   **Safety:** Prevent falls. Achieve independence in bed mobility. Perform transfers (bed-chair, chair-toilet) with minimal assistance and verbal cues.
*   **Mobility:** Improve standing balance to Level III (able to stand with feet together unsupported for 30 seconds). Ambulate 15 meters indoors with a quad cane and minimal assistance, demonstrating a safe gait pattern.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):** Achieve independence in feeding and grooming. Require only supervision for upper body dressing.
*   **Cognition:** Improve sustained attention to consistently participate in 20-minute therapy sessions. Improve orientation to time and place within the hospital setting. Begin training on the use of a memory aid (e.g., a simple daily schedule board).
*   **Patient/Family Education:** Patient and spouse will be able to verbalize a basic understanding of stroke, identify 3 personal risk factors, and demonstrate 2 fall prevention strategies.

#### Long-term goals (at discharge):
*   **Mobility:** Achieve independent ambulation indoors with a quad cane. Navigate a flight of stairs with a railing under supervision.
*   **ADL:** Achieve modified independence (requiring setup or supervision) for most self-care activities, including bathing and lower body dressing. Target MBI score > 75.
*   **Cognition:** Independently use compensatory strategies (e.g., daily planner, alarms) to manage daily schedule and remember key tasks. Demonstrate improved judgment in simple, structured daily routines.
*   **Community Integration:** Safely discharge home with spouse as the primary caregiver. The family will be trained to provide the necessary level of supervision and assistance. Successfully implement risk factor modification (smoking and alcohol cessation).

### 2. Treatment Methods

A comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach is required, focusing heavily on managing the severe executive dysfunction which is the primary barrier to functional recovery.

#### Physical Therapy (PT)
*   **Balance Training:** Progress from static to dynamic balance exercises. Start with a wide base of support, progressing to a narrow base, tandem stance, and single-leg stance on the unaffected side. Incorporate reaching activities in standing to challenge postural control. Use visual feedback from a mirror.
*   **Gait Training:** Begin in parallel bars to improve gait mechanics, focusing on weight-shifting, heel-strike, and symmetrical step length. Progress to over-ground ambulation with a quad cane for a stable base of support. Emphasize task-specific training, including walking on different surfaces and navigating obstacles.
*   **Functional Strength Training:** Focus on closed-chain exercises for the left lower extremity (e.g., sit-to-stand repetitions, mini-squats, step-ups) to improve functional power and stability. Strengthen core musculature to enhance balance.
*   **Stair Training:** Initiate training on simulated steps, focusing on the pattern of "up with the good, down with the bad." Progress to a full flight of stairs with a railing as balance and strength improve.
*   **Transfer Training:** Repetitive practice of sit-to-stand, bed-to-chair, and toilet transfers, providing verbal and tactile cues to ensure safety and proper technique.

#### Occupational Therapy (OT)
*   **Cognitive Rehabilitation (Executive Function Focus):**
    *   Implement highly structured, errorless learning tasks related to ADLs. Avoid abstract tasks (like the WCST) where the patient is likely to fail and become frustrated.
    *   **Task-Specific Training:** Break down activities like grooming, dressing, and simple meal preparation into sequential steps. Use visual aids (checklists, picture sequences) to guide the patient.
    *   **Compensatory Strategy Training:** Introduce and drill the use of external aids like a large-print daily planner, a whiteboard for reminders, and smartphone alarms. Repetition and consistency are paramount.
*   **ADL Retraining:**
    *   Practice self-care tasks in a realistic environment.
    *   Introduce adaptive equipment as needed (e.g., shower chair, long-handled sponge, button hook, elastic shoelaces) and train the patient and spouse in their use.
    *   Train one-handed techniques for tasks where bimanual coordination is difficult.
*   **Upper Extremity and Hand Function:** Although strength is Grade 4, focus on improving motor control, speed, and dexterity through graded functional tasks (e.g., manipulating objects of various sizes, using utensils, buttoning).

#### Speech-Language Pathology (SLP)
*   **Cognitive-Communication Therapy:**
    *   Address the executive dysfunction impacting communication. Use structured conversation to work on topic maintenance and reducing tangential/irrelevant responses.
    *   Work on improving abstract reasoning and problem-solving using simple, concrete social scenarios ("What would you do if the fire alarm went off?").
*   **Attention Training:** Utilize computer-based programs and functional tasks to improve sustained and selective attention.
*   **Memory Strategy Training:** Work in conjunction with OT to reinforce the use of memory notebooks and calendars. Practice recall of daily events and therapy schedules.
*   **Reading and Writing:** Address deficits identified in the MMSE. Start with functional tasks like reading a menu or medication labels and writing a simple shopping list.

#### General Rehabilitation Management
*   **Patient and Family Education:** Conduct regular family meetings with the spouse to provide education on the patient's cognitive deficits (especially the poor judgment and lack of insight), secondary stroke prevention (critical focus on smoking and alcohol cessation), home safety modifications, and realistic discharge expectations.
*   **Neuropsychology Consultation:** Recommended for formal assessment of mood and adjustment to disability, and to provide counseling and support to the spouse who will be the primary caregiver.
*   **Pharmacological Management:** Ensure strict adherence to prescribed medications for secondary stroke prevention (e.g., antiplatelets, statins, antihypertensives).
*   **Team Conferences:** Regular interdisciplinary team meetings to ensure all therapies are aligned, particularly in the approach to cognitive rehabilitation and the consistent implementation of compensatory strategies.
