# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks):
- Improve swallowing safety to reduce choking and aspiration risk during oral intake.
- Enhance tongue mobility and strength to improve bolus propulsion and swallowing initiation.
- Improve phonation clarity and voice quality to enhance communication effectiveness.
- Maintain current level of independence in activities of daily living (ADLs).
- Address depressed mood to improve emotional well-being and engagement in therapy.

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
 Achieve consistent safe oral intake with modified food/liquid consistencies, minimizing aspiration risk (target FOIS Level 6).
- Improve dysarthria to achieve functional communication with clear speech in daily interactions.
- Maintain or improve orofacial muscle strength and coordination for sustained swallowing and phonation function.
- Preserve ambulation and ADL independence (maintain Modified Barthel Index at 100 points).
- Promote psychological resilience and coping strategies to manage chronic disease progression.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Swallowing Rehabilitation
- **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES):** Apply NMES to suprahyoid and pharyngeal muscles to enhance swallowing coordination and strength. of 30 minutes, 5 times for 4 weeks, adjusted based on tolerance.
- **Swallowing Exercises:**
  - **Effortful Swallow:** Practice effortful swallowing to strengthen pharyngeal muscles, 10 repetitions/set, 3 sets/day.
  - **Mendelsohn Maneuver:** Hold Adam’s apple elevated for 2–3 seconds during swallow to improve laryngeal elevation, 10 repetitions/set, 3 sets/day.
  - **Shaker Exercise:** Perform head-lift exercises to strengthen suprahyoid muscles, 3 sets of 10 repetitions/day.
  - **Tongue Strengthening Exercises:** Use tongue resistance exercises (e.g., pushing against a spoon or tongue depressor) to improve tongue mobility and strength, 10 repetitions in all directions, 3 sets/day.
- **Dietary Modifications:** Maintain FOIS Level 5 diet (soft, moist foods, thickened liquids). Collaborate with a dietitian to ensure adequate nutrition and hydration. Use compensatory strategies (e.g., small bites, slow eating, chin-tuck posture during swallowing).
- **Oral Hygiene Program:** Implement rigorous oral care (brushing, rinsing) post-meals to reduce aspiration risk due to poor oral hygiene, supervised by nursing staff.

### B. Speech and Phonation Therapy
- **Speech Therapy:** Work with a speech-language pathologist (SLP) for 45-minute sessions, 4 times/week, focusing on:
  - **Articulation Exercises:** Practice clear enunciation of vowels and consonants to improve dysarthria, targeting lip and tongue precision.
  - **Voice Training:** Use Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD) techniques to enhance vocal loudness and clarity, 4 sessions/week for 4 weeks.
  - **Soft Palate Exercises:** Perform blowing and sucking exercises (e.g., straw exercises) to improve soft palate elevation, 10 repetitions/set, 3 sets/day.
- **Compensatory Strategies:** Teach pacing techniques (e.g., pausing between phrases) to reduce fatigue and improve speech intelligibility.

### C. Physical Therapy
- **General Conditioning:** Maintain current ambulation and ADL independence with a daily exercise program including:
  - **Aerobic Exercise:** Stationary cycling or treadmill walking (if tolerated) at moderate intensity, 20 minutes/day, 5 days/week, to maintain cardiovascular health and muscle endurance.
  - **Balance Training:** Standing balance exercises (e.g., tandem stance, single-leg stance) to maintain Holden Functional Ambulation Classification Level 5, 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week.
- **Strength Maintenance:** Low-resistance exercises for upper and lower limbs (e.g., seated arm raises, leg extensions) to preserve MMT 5/5 strength, 10 repetitions/set, 2 sets/day.

### D. Psychological Support
- **Counseling:** Weekly 30-minute sessions with a clinical psychologist to address depressed mood, focusing on coping strategies and emotional support for chronic disease management.
- **Support Group Participation:** Encourage enrollment in a motor neuron disease support group to foster peer interaction and emotional resilience, 1 session/week.

### E. Monitoring andassessment
- **Weekly Monitoring:** Assess swallowing function (Kub’s Water Swallow Test, SSA) and speech clarity weekly to track progress and adjust interventions.
- **Reassessment at 4 Weeks:** Repeat swallowing function scales (FOIS, SSA) and evaluate dysarthria improvements. Adjust NMES intensity, exercise repetitions, or dietary recommendations based on outcomes.
- **Multidisciplinary Team Meetings:** Weekly reviews with the rehabilitation team (physician, SLP, physical therapist, dietitian, psychologist) to ensure coordinated care.

### F. Patient and Caregiver Education
- **Swallowing Safety Training:** Educate patient and caregivers on aspiration precautions, proper positioning (upright during meals), and recognition of choking signs.
- **Home Exercise Program:** Provide written and demonstrated instructions for swallowing and speech exercises to ensure adherence at home.
- **Disease Education:** Discuss motor neuron disease progression, emphasizing the importance of consistent therapy and follow-up to maintain function.
