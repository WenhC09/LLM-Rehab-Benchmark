# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

*   **Short-term Goals:** Improve range of motion and strength of swallowing-related organs, reduce water aspiration during drinking, overcome hypernasality, and enhance speech intelligibility.
*   **Long-term Goals:** Achieve safe oral intake of a soft diet, further improve speech intelligibility, and reach a level enabling verbal communication for most daily living activities.

### 2. Treatment Methods

Based on the patient's primary clinical manifestations of dysarthria and dysphagia, the following specialized and systematic rehabilitation training protocol has been formulated and implemented in addition to conventional rehabilitation therapy:

*   **Training for Dysarthria:**
    *   **Oromotor Exercises:** Exercises targeting range of motion, strength, and flexibility of the articulatory organs (lips, tongue, mandible, etc.).
    *   **Articulation and Phonation Training:** Targeted exercises for phonation, sound discrimination, and articulation.
    *   **Hypernasality Reduction Training:** Specific techniques to train velopharyngeal function to reduce nasal resonance in speech.
    *   **Respiratory Control Training:** Aims to strengthen respiratory muscle strength and coordination to provide stable airflow support for phonation.

*   **Training for Dysphagia:**
    *   **Oral Sensory Stimulation:** Intraoral ice stimulation to elicit the swallowing reflex.
    *   **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES):** Application of intraoral electrical stimulation to promote contraction and coordination of swallowing-related muscles.
    *   **Oromotor Function Training:** Exercises for motor function of swallowing-related organs, including ice stick sucking exercises, laryngeal elevation exercises, mandibular resistance exercises, and Shaker exercises to enhance strength and coordination of swallowing musculature.
    *   **Direct Feeding Training:** Safe direct feeding training under therapist supervision; specifically water swallowing training at this stage to improve feeding safety and efficiency.
    *   **Airway Protection Training:** Effective cough training to enhance airway protection and reduce aspiration risk.
