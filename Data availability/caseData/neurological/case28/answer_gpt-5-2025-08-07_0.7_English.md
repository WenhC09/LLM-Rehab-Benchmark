# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2–4 weeks)
- Improve oral motor control and coordination to reduce choking episodes during meals.
- Enhance swallowing safety by adopting compensatory postures and techniques.
- Maintain adequate nutrition and hydration through adjusted diet texture and pacing strategies.
- Improve articulation clarity to enhance daily communication.
- Educate patient and caregivers on swallowing precautions and aspiration prevention.
- Maintain current limb motor function and overall independence in ADLs.

### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
- Maximize safe oral intake, delaying the need for alternative feeding methods as long as possible.
- Maintain stable weight and nutritional status.
- Slow progression of dysphagia-related complications (aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition).
- Optimize intelligibility of speech for essential communication needs.
- Preserve limb function, endurance, and mobility to sustain independence.
- Support psychosocial well-being and adaptation to progressive neurological condition.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### (A) Swallowing Function Training
1. **Compensatory strategies**  
   - Chin-tuck posture during swallowing to reduce aspiration risk.  
   - Small bolus size, slow rate of intake.  
   - Alternate solids and liquids to assist bolus clearance.  
   - Avoid thin liquids unless modified by thickening agents.

2. **Dietary modification**  
   - FOIS-compatible diet: soft, moist, semi-solid foods; avoid dry, crumbly, or mixed-texture foods.  
   - Use of commercial or homemade thickeners for liquids to nectar/honey consistency as indicated by ongoing assessment.

3. **Oropharyngeal exercises** (as tolerated, considering fatigue and disease progression)  
   - Tongue range-of-motion and resistance exercises (protrusion, lateralization, elevation).  
   - Effortful swallow training to improve pharyngeal contraction.  
   - Mendelsohn maneuver and supraglottic swallow (if patient can perform safely).  
   - Lip and buccal strengthening exercises to improve bolus control.

4. **Airway protection training**  
   - Voluntary cough and throat-clearing practice before and after swallows.  
   - Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) with appropriate resistance.

5. **Swallowing therapy frequency**  
   - 20–30 minutes per session, 5–6 days/week, with rest breaks to avoid fatigue.

### (B) Speech and Communication Therapy
1. **Articulation training**  
   - Practice over-articulation and slowed speech rate.  
   - Target problematic consonants and vowels identified during assessment.

2. **Voice therapy**  
   - Breath support training for phonation.  
   - Resonance exercises to reduce hypernasality if present.

3. **Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)**  
   - Introduce simple communication aids early (writing boards, smartphone apps) to prepare for potential speech decline.

---

### (C) General Physical Function Maintenance
1. **Mobility and balance training**
   - Maintain independent ambulation with gait and balance exercises.  
   - Static and dynamic balance training within safety limits.

2. **Strength and endurance**
   - Gentle limb strengthening and aerobic conditioning (walking, stationary cycling) to maintain cardiovascular fitness and prevent deconditioning.

3. **Flexibility**
   - Stretching exercises to prevent contractures and maintain joint mobility.

---

### (D) Respiratory Function Support
- Breathing exercises (diaphragmatic breathing, inspiratory muscle training if tolerated).
- Monitor for signs of respiratory muscle weakness.
- Educate patient and caregivers on secretion management techniques.

---

### (E) Education and Psychosocial Support
- Educate patient/family on nature of motor neuron disease, swallowing safety, and aspiration precautions.
- Nutritional counseling with dietitian involvement for calorie and protein optimization.
- Psychological support to address mood changes and coping strategies.
- Social work involvement for planning future care needs and resources.

---

### (F) Monitoring & Reassessment
- Weekly swallowing function reassessment (Kubota, SSA, FOIS) to adjust diet and techniques.
- Periodic speech intelligibility assessment.
- Nutritional status and weight monitoring every 2 weeks.
- Adjust therapy intensity according to fatigue levels and disease progression.
