# Patient Medical Record

## I. Clinical Summary

* **Patient**: Male, 69 years old.  
* **Chief Complaint**: Slurred speech accompanied by dysphagia for over 1 year.  
* **History of Present Illness**: In late 2019, the patient developed slurred speech and dysphagia without clear precipitating factors, with no other accompanying symptoms such as limb mobility impairment. He sought treatment at the local hospital’s Neurology Department. Cranial MRI revealed: **Multiple lacunar infarcts**. During hospitalization, symptomatic and supportive treatments were administered, including **antiplatelet aggregation therapy**, **neurotrophic agents**, and medications to **improve circulation and metabolism**. In May 2022, he was re-admitted to the local hospital due to worsened dysphagia. Cranial MRA showed: **Atherosclerotic changes in cranial and cervical arteries**. Treatments included **antiplatelet aggregation therapy**, **neurotrophic agents**, **circulation-improving agents**, **anticholinesterase agents** (for anti-myasthenia), **anti-inflammatory drugs**, and symptomatic support. In November 2022, he visited Huashan Hospital, Fudan University. Electromyography (EMG) indicated **damage to anterior horn cells and cranial nerve motor nuclei**, leading to a diagnosis of **"Motor Neuron Disease"** (specific treatment details unknown). Due to persistent slurred speech, dysphagia, and coughing during oral intake of food/fluids, he was admitted to our department on April 3, 2023, for further rehabilitation. Since onset, the patient has maintained fair mental status, though with depressed mood. Appetite, sleep, bowel, and bladder functions are normal. Weight loss noted. Currently able to stand/walk independently. Independently performs ADLs including eating, dressing, transferring, toileting, and bathing.  
* **Past Medical History**: Hypertension (>10 years), Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (>10 years). No history of smoking or alcohol use.  
* **Family History**: Denies family history of genetic disorders or similar diseases.  
* **Physical Examination**: Temperature 36.1°C, Pulse 92 bpm, Respiration 21 bpm, BP 130/75 mmHg. Alert, moderate nutritional status. Wheelchair-bound upon admission. Clear breath sounds bilaterally, no dry/coarse rales. Cardiac and abdominal examinations unremarkable.  
* **Specialized Examination**: Alert, fair mental status. **Dysarthria** present. Memory and calculation abilities essentially normal. Full ocular movements, no nystagmus or diplopia. Pupils bilaterally equal and round (≈3mm diameter), direct/indirect light reflexes intact. Facial pain/touch sensation symmetrical and normal. Bilateral forehead wrinkles symmetrical, nasolabial folds symmetrical. No deviation on teeth showing. **Diminished gag reflex**. Weak tongue protrusion, coughing during water intake. Manual Muscle Testing (MMT): Upper limbs proximal/distal 5/5, Lower limbs proximal/distal 5/5. Modified Ashworth Scale: Normal muscle tone in all limbs. Pinprick, light touch, vibratory sensation symmetrical without reduction; joint position sense normal. Biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Patellar and Achilles reflexes 2+ bilaterally, ankle clonus 2+. Hoffmann sign (-) bilaterally, Babinski sign (-) bilaterally. Holden Functional Ambulation Classification: Level 5. Functional Assessment: Sitting balance Level 3, Standing balance Level 3. Modified Barthel Index: 100 points.

## II. Rehabilitation Assessment & Quantitative Examination

### 1. Subjective Symptoms  
Weight loss, abnormal voice quality, drooling, thick saliva, poor oral hygiene, poor intake of liquids/solids, slow eating speed, prone to choking/coughing, poor mastication, poor tongue propulsion, delayed swallowing initiation, uncoordinated pharyngeal phase, fatigue during meals.

### 2. Functional Assessment  
Orofacial dysfunction: Tongue deviation to left, reduced tongue mobility (insufficient range in all directions), diminished gag reflex, delayed swallowing initiation, weakened voluntary cough, delayed cough, weakened voluntary throat clearing, delayed throat clearing. Phonation abnormalities: Hoarse voice quality, insufficient soft palate elevation. Labial dysfunction: Normal lip closure; insufficient puckering, lip rounding, grinning, cheek puffing; reduced lip/masseter strength. Normal jaw movements. (Initial admission assessment on 2023-04-03: Weak tongue protrusion).

### 3. Swallowing Function Scales  
*   **Kubota's Water Swallow Test:** Grade II  
*   **Standardized Swallowing Assessment (SSA):** 25 points  
*   **Swallowing Function Grade:** Level 4 (Chance aspiration present)  
*   **Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS):** Level 5 (Total oral diet of multiple consistencies, but requires special preparation/compensation).

## III. Auxiliary Examinations  

1.  **Cranial MRI (May 2022):** Atherosclerotic changes in cranial and cervical arteries.  
2.  **Electromyography (EMG) (November 2022):** Damage to anterior horn cells and cranial nerve motor nuclei.

## IV. Diagnosis  

**Medical Diagnosis:** Motor Neuron Disease.  
**Functional Diagnosis:**  
① Dysarthria.  
② Dysphagia.
