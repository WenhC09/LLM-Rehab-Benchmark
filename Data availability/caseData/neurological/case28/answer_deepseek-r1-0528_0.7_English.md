### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

#### 1. Rehabilitation Goals  
**Short-term goals (1-4 weeks):**  
- Reduce aspiration risk during liquid intake (target: Kubota Test improvement to Grade I).  
- Improve lingual propulsion strength for bolus transfer (target: 20% increase in tongue pressure measurements).  
- Enhance swallowing initiation latency (target: <2 seconds for pharyngeal trigger).  
- Improve vocal clarity for basic communication (target: 50% intelligibility in single words).  
- Maintain current nutritional status (target: <2% body weight loss).  

**Long-term goals (3-6 months):**  
- Achieve safe oral intake of all textures (FOIS Level 6: total oral diet without restrictions).  
- Establish effective compensatory communication methods.  
- Prevent aspiration pneumonia.  
- Preserve independent ADLs (maintain Barthel Index ≥95).  

#### 2. Treatment Methods  
**A. Dysphagia Management**  
- *Compensatory Strategies:*  
  - Chin tuck during liquid swallows  
  - Double swallow technique  
  - Texture modification: Level 3 IDDSI liquids, soft-solid diet  
- *Direct Swallowing Therapy:*  
  - Effortful swallow exercises (3 sets × 10 reps, 2x/day)  
  - Masako maneuver (tongue hold swallow)  
  - Thermal-tactile stimulation (ice lolly application)  
  - Shaker head lift exercise protocol  
- *Strength Training:*  
  - Tongue resistance exercises using IOPI device  
  - Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST 150 device)  

**B. Dysarthria Intervention**  
- *Respiratory-Phonatory Training:*  
  - Breath stacking techniques  
  - Maximum phonation time exercises  
  - Voice amplification system trial  
- *Articulatory Precision:*  
  - Minimal contrast word drills (e.g., "buy" vs "pie")  
  - Over-articulation practice with visual biofeedback  
- *Communication Backup:*  
  - Low-tech alphabet board training  
  - AAC device evaluation (eye-gaze system)  

**C. Comprehensive Support**  
- *Nutritional Optimization:*  
  - High-calorie puree supplements (1.5 kcal/mL)  
  - Scheduled hydration protocol (thickened fluids)  
- *Oral Hygiene Protocol:*  
  - Post-oral intake 0.12% chlorhexidine rinses  
  - Daily tongue scraping  
- *Psychosocial Support:*  
  - Weekly speech therapy counseling  
  - Referral to MND support group  
- *Progression Monitoring:*  
  - Weekly SSA reassessment  
  - Monthly videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS)  
  - Daily swallowing diary tracking
