# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

**Patient:** Male, 69 years old
**Diagnosis:** Motor Neuron Disease; Dysarthria; Dysphagia

---

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals:

#### Short-term goals (within 4-6 weeks):
*   **Safety:** Prevent aspiration and respiratory complications. Patient will demonstrate consistent use of safe swallowing strategies and modified diet/liquids without signs of aspiration (coughing, choking, wet voice) in 100% of meals.
*   **Nutrition:** Stabilize body weight and prevent further loss. Maintain current weight with no more than 2% variation.
*   **Function:** Improve oral motor control and coordination for more efficient bolus management, reducing meal times and fatigue during eating.
*   **Communication:** Improve speech intelligibility for effective communication of basic needs and wants with family and staff.
*   **Education:** Patient and family will verbalize and demonstrate understanding of the diagnosis, safe swallowing precautions, diet modifications, and signs of aspiration or respiratory distress.
*   **Psychological:** Alleviate low mood by providing support and enhancing the patient's sense of control over manageable symptoms.

#### Long-term goals:
*   **Swallowing & Nutrition:** Maintain safe and adequate oral nutrition for as long as possible. Ensure timely and informed decision-making regarding the potential future need for non-oral feeding (e.g., PEG tube) to prevent crisis-driven placement.
*   **Communication:** Maintain the ability to communicate effectively as speech deteriorates, through mastery of compensatory strategies and/or successful implementation of an appropriate Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) system.
*   **Function & Quality of Life:** Maintain maximum independence in ADLs using energy conservation techniques. Preserve mobility and prevent complications of immobility. Enhance overall quality of life by managing symptoms and supporting continued social engagement.
*   **Respiratory:** Maintain optimal respiratory function and effectively manage secretions to prevent pulmonary infections.

### 2. Treatment Methods:

#### I. Swallowing Therapy
*   **Dietary Modification:**
    *   **Consistency:** Immediately implement a modified diet. Based on assessments (Swallowing Function Grade 4), start with **Level 5 - Minced & Moist** foods and progress to **Level 4 - Pureed** if fatigue or residue is significant.
    *   **Liquids:** All liquids must be thickened to at least a **Nectar-thick (Level 2)** or **Honey-thick (Level 3)** consistency to slow bolus flow and reduce aspiration risk.
*   **Compensatory Swallowing Strategies:**
    *   **Postural Techniques:** Instruct patient to maintain a fully upright (90-degree) posture during and for 30 minutes after all meals. Implement the **chin-tuck maneuver** to protect the airway.
    *   **Swallowing Maneuvers:** Train the patient in the **effortful swallow** to improve tongue base retraction and pharyngeal clearance, and the **supraglottic swallow** to improve airway closure.
*   **Oral and Pharyngeal Motor Exercises (Focus on coordination and endurance, avoiding over-fatigue):**
    *   **Lingual Exercises:** Active range of motion exercises for the tongue (protrusion, retraction, lateralization, elevation) to maintain mobility and improve bolus manipulation. No high-resistance exercises.
    *   **Lip and Facial Exercises:** Exercises for lip closure, puckering, and smiling to manage drooling and improve bolus containment. Cheek puffing exercises to maintain buccinator tone.
    *   **Palatal Exercises:** Yawning and forceful "ahh" sounds to encourage soft palate elevation.
    *   **Laryngeal Elevation Exercises:** Trial of Mendelsohn maneuver and/or Shaker exercise (head lift), carefully monitored for fatigue.
*   **Sensory Stimulation:**
    *   Employ **thermal-tactile stimulation** (stroking anterior faucial arches with a chilled laryngeal mirror) before meals to heighten sensory awareness and reduce the delay in swallow initiation.

#### II. Speech Therapy (Dysarthria Management)
*   **Pacing and Phrasing:** Teach the patient to slow their rate of speech, over-articulate consonants, and break sentences into shorter phrases to improve intelligibility.
*   **Respiratory Support for Speech:** Instruct in diaphragmatic breathing to provide better breath support for phonation, reducing vocal strain and hoarseness.
*   **Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) Planning:**
    *   **Immediate (Low-Tech):** Introduce and train the use of a pen and paper, a whiteboard, or an alphabet/picture board as a backup communication method when speech is not understood.
    *   **Future (High-Tech):** Begin discussion and education about high-tech AAC options (e.g., text-to-speech applications on a tablet, eye-gaze technology) for use as the disease progresses.

#### III. Nutritional Management
*   **Dietitian Consultation:** Formal consultation to establish a high-calorie, high-protein meal plan that incorporates the required texture modifications.
*   **Monitoring:** Strict monitoring of daily caloric intake, fluid intake, and body weight (at least twice weekly).
*   **PEG Tube Discussion:** Initiate a proactive, sensitive discussion with the patient and family about the role and timing of a Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) tube as a future option to ensure adequate nutrition and hydration when oral intake becomes unsafe or insufficient.

#### IV. Respiratory Management
*   **Breathing Exercises:** Teach diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing to maximize lung capacity and gas exchange.
*   **Airway Clearance Techniques:** Instruct the patient in huffing and assisted coughing techniques to help mobilize thick saliva and secretions, reducing the risk of infection.
*   **Education:** Educate the patient and family on early signs of respiratory insufficiency, such as morning headaches, daytime fatigue, and shortness of breath when lying down.

#### V. Physical and Occupational Therapy Consultation
*   **Energy Conservation:** Despite current high functional scores (mBI=100), a consultation is warranted to proactively teach energy conservation and work simplification techniques for all ADLs to manage fatigue and preserve strength for vital functions like breathing and swallowing.
*   **Functional Monitoring:** Establish a baseline for limb strength, balance, and mobility to carefully track any future decline. Provide a home exercise program focused on gentle range of motion and stretching, not strengthening, to prevent joint stiffness.

#### VI. Psychological Support
*   **Supportive Counseling:** Provide regular opportunities for the patient and family to express feelings and concerns related to the diagnosis and its impact.
*   **Coping Strategies:** Offer strategies for managing anxiety, particularly related to mealtimes and choking fears.
*   **Support Group Referral:** Provide information on local or national Motor Neuron Disease support groups for peer support for both the patient and his family.
