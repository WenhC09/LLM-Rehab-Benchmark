# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals:
*   Stabilize medical status and facilitate early removal of nasogastric tube, urinary catheter, and PICC line.
*   Improve mood disorders: alleviate apathy in the initial phase; control agitation and impulsivity in the intermediate phase; enhance motivation and compliance with rehabilitation.
*   Improve basic motor functions: achieve independent rolling and sitting up; perform transfers and standing with minimal assistance.
*   Enhance swallowing function to restore safe oral feeding.
*   Improve fundamental speech functions: augment auditory comprehension and willingness for verbal communication.

### Long-term Goals:
*   Achieve emotional stability with effective self-regulation.
*   Establish independent and stable ambulation capacity.
*   Restore fluent, logical verbal communication for normal social interactions.
*   Maximize recovery of cognitive functions, particularly short-term memory, working memory, and executive functions; enable learning new tasks and performing familiar daily activities.
*   Restore activities of daily living (ADL) for eventual community reintegration.

## 2. Treatment Methods

Rehabilitation strategies are phased according to Rancho Los Amigos (RLA) cognitive levels:

### Phase I (RLA Level IV - Initial Rehabilitation)

Focus: Medical stabilization, mood improvement, and induction of basic functions for patients presenting with apathy, short attention span, and poor compliance.

*   **Pharmacotherapy:**
    *   Cognitive enhancement: Donepezil, Memantine.
    *   Epilepsy prophylaxis: Sodium Valproate Sustained-Release Tablets.
    *   Sleep improvement: Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets.
    *   Symptomatic support: Lactulose for constipation management.
*   **Psychological & Behavioral Interventions:**
    *   Address apathy through music therapy, group therapy, and psychological counseling.
    *   Apply motivational interviewing techniques to enhance treatment engagement.
*   **Physical Therapy (PT):**
    *   Passive standing training via standing bed to improve weight-bearing tolerance and cardiovascular endurance (targeting lower limb weakness, poor balance, fatigue).
    *   Lower limb endurance and coordination training using cycle ergometer.
    *   Upper limb robotic-assisted training for motor function induction.
*   **Occupational Therapy (OT):**
    *   Basic activity training (rolling, sitting up, bed-chair transfers) addressing initiation difficulties and attentional deficits.
    *   Trunk control training for seated balance maintenance.
    *   Graded task guidance to build tolerance for weight-bearing during transfers.
*   **Speech Therapy (ST):**
    *   Respiratory relaxation, phonation, and prosody modulation training to improve breath-voice coordination.
    *   Auditory comprehension drills using simple commands to enhance compliance.
*   **Swallowing Therapy:**
    *   Cold stimulation and orofacial muscle exercises to activate swallowing reflexes and strengthen labial/lingual/buccal function.
    *   Therapeutic feeding trials under supervision for graded oral intake resumption.

### Phase II (RLA Levels V-VI - Intermediate Rehabilitation)

Focus: Comprehensive rehabilitation addressing agitation/impulsivity with improved medication compliance.

*   **Pharmacotherapy:**
    *   Agitation/impulsivity control: Quetiapine with dose titration based on symptoms.
*   **Physical Therapy (PT):**
    *   Enhanced head-neck-trunk control training to reduce rigidity.
    *   Progressive limb and core strengthening exercises.
    *   Guided training for verbal command-to-action translation.
    *   Advanced balance and gait stability training: weight shifting, coordination drills.
*   **Occupational Therapy (OT):**
    *   Cognition-based functional training: visual scanning/ocular motility, spatial attention, episodic memory.
    *   Left-hand fine motor training integrated with command comprehension/execution.
*   **Speech Therapy (ST):**
    *   Intensive semantic comprehension training.
    *   Repetition and naming drills using multimodal cues (pictures, objects, semantic association).
    *   Dedicated calculation and writing skills training.
*   **Neuromodulation:**
    *   **Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber Therapy:** Enhances cerebral circulation for global functional recovery.
    *   **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS):** Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting cerebellar circuits (due to bilateral frontal bone defects) to modulate cognition-related pathways.
    *   **Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS):** Bilateral orbitofrontal cortex stimulation (1mA, 20min) to ameliorate psychiatric symptoms and executive dysfunction.

### Phase III (RLA Levels VI-VII - Advanced Rehabilitation)

Focus: High-intensity training for community reintegration.

*   **Physical Therapy (PT):**
    *   Progressive balance training (handrail-supported â†’ independent).
    *   Task-oriented control/coordination training simulating complex ADL movements.
    *   Dual-task training (e.g., walking while reciting poetry) integrating motor and cognitive demands.
    *   Motor memory consolidation using Purdue Pegboard Test.
    *   Gamified training to enhance engagement.
*   **Occupational Therapy (OT):**
    *   Home environment modification guidance aligned with functional capacity.
    *   Development and instruction of home exercise program.
    *   Work simulation training (e.g., keyboarding) for vocational re-entry preparation.
*   **Speech Therapy (ST):**
    *   Advanced reading comprehension for information processing.
    *   Continued naming and writing drills to reduce semantic paraphasias.
    *   Functional communication training: context-based dialogues for pragmatic and logical language use.
