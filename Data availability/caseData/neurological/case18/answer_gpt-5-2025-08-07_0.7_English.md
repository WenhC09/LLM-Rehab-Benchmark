# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4 weeks)
1. Improve sitting balance from current level 1 to at least level 2–3, enabling maintenance of unsupported sitting for >5 minutes.
2. Increase Berg Balance Scale score by ≥5 points.
3. Improve limb muscle strength by at least one manual muscle test (MMT) grade in affected muscle groups.
4. Enhance grip strength by ≥2 kg bilaterally.
5. Advance Rancho Los Amigos cognitive level from IV toward V, with improved attention span and ability to follow 1-step simple commands in ≥50% of attempts.
6. Initiate basic communication — produce intelligible single words or short phrases with cues.
7. Improve swallowing safety — reduce Water Swallowing Test level from 4 to 3, decrease aspiration risk, and consider partial oral intake trials if safe.
8. Increase Modified Barthel Index (MBI) from 20 to ≥35 through improvement in self-feeding (if safe), grooming, and transfer assistance levels.
9. Reduce neurobehavioral symptoms (irritability, apathy) through structured environment and behavioral interventions.
10. Improve sleep quality with non-pharmacologic strategies.

### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
1. Achieve independent sitting balance and progress to standing with minimal assistance; aim for Berg Balance Scale ≥40.
2. Restore functional use of both upper limbs for basic ADLs, with Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score above 80 bilaterally.
3. Ambulate short distances indoors with assistive device and supervision.
4. Achieve Rancho Los Amigos level VI or higher; improve MoCA score to ≥15 through cognitive rehabilitation.
5. Improve expressive and receptive language to WAB AQ >50, enabling basic daily communication.
6. Transition to full oral feeding with safe swallow, discontinue nasogastric tube if possible.
7. Increase MBI to ≥60, enabling partial independence in basic ADLs.
8. Enhance social participation and emotional adjustment; involve in simple community or family activities.
9. Support return to light pre-injury roles where feasible.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 Physical Therapy (PT)
- **Positioning & Early Mobilization**: Maintain proper limb positioning to prevent contractures; use tilt table or supported standing frame as tolerated.
- **Balance Training**: 
  - Initiate sitting balance exercises with progressive reduction in external support.
  - Use reaching tasks in multiple directions to improve trunk control.
- **Strength Training**:
  - Active-assisted → active → resisted exercises for both upper and lower limbs, focusing on proximal stability.
  - Grip strength training with hand grippers, putty, or spring devices.
- **Bed Mobility & Transfer Training**: Practice rolling, supine-to-sit, and pivot transfers with therapist assistance.
- **Gait Preparation**: Weight-shift training, supported stepping in parallel bars when safe.

### 2.2 Occupational Therapy (OT)
- **ADL Training**: 
  - Begin with self-feeding (if swallow safe), grooming, and dressing using adaptive techniques.
  - Practice task-specific training in a simulated home environment.
- **Upper Limb Function**:
  - Fine motor coordination exercises (peg boards, picking up small objects).
  - Bilateral integration activities to encourage symmetrical use.
- **Sensory-Motor Integration**: Incorporate proprioceptive and tactile stimulation into activities.

### 2.3 Speech and Language Therapy (SLT)
- **Aphasia Management**:
  - Use multimodal communication: gestures, pictures, communication boards.
  - Structured naming, repetition, and comprehension tasks.
- **Dysarthria Management**:
  - Oral motor exercises to improve articulation and breath support.
  - Loudness and clarity drills.
- **Swallowing Therapy**:
  - Oral motor strengthening (tongue, lips, cheeks).
  - Compensatory swallowing techniques (chin tuck, effortful swallow).
  - Gradual introduction of safe textures based on repeat swallow assessment.

### 2.4 Cognitive Rehabilitation
- **Attention & Memory Training**:
  - Simple attention tasks (sorting, matching).
  - External memory aids (calendar, picture cues).
- **Orientation**:
  - Daily orientation board (date, place, weather).
- **Problem-solving & Executive Function**:
  - Step-by-step task breakdown.
  - Structured decision-making scenarios.

### 2.5 Neuropsychological & Behavioral Management
- Maintain structured daily routine.
- Use positive reinforcement to encourage engagement.
- Provide emotional support; consider psychological counseling as tolerated.
- Educate family on behavioral strategies.

### 2.6 Swallowing and Nutrition Management
- Continue nasogastric feeding until safe oral intake confirmed.
- Conduct repeat swallowing assessments periodically.
- Collaborate with dietitian for nutritional optimization to address weight loss.

### 2.7 Medical Management Support
- Monitor for complications: infection recurrence, spasticity, pressure sores.
- Continue antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B under hepatology guidance.
- Pulmonary hygiene: breathing exercises, assisted coughing, incentive spirometry.

### 2.8 Sleep Hygiene Intervention
- Establish fixed sleep-wake schedule.
- Limit daytime naps.
- Provide quiet, dimly lit environment at night.

### 2.9 Family Education & Training
- Train caregivers in safe transfers, feeding techniques, communication support, and home exercise program.
- Involve family in therapy sessions to reinforce practice.

**Note**: Therapy intensity should be tailored to patient tolerance, with frequent reassessment of goals and safety status. Interdisciplinary team coordination is essential.
