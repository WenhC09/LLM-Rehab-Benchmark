    *   Perform bed-to-chair transfers with moderate to maximum assistance.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):**
    *   Participate in basic ADLs (e.g., facial grooming, upper body dressing) with maximum assistance, using hand-over-hand techniques.
    *   Initiate a bladder training program in preparation for urinary catheter removal.

#### Long-term goals (Next 3-6 months):
*   **Cognition & Behavior:**
    *   Achieve consistent orientation to person and place.
    *   Improve memory and problem-solving skills to ensure safety during daily activities.
*   **Communication & Swallowing:**
    *   Achieve functional verbal or non-verbal communication to express basic needs and ideas.
    *   Transition from nasogastric tube feeding to a modified texture oral diet without signs of aspiration.
*   **Motor Function & Mobility:**
    *   Achieve independent ambulation over short distances on level surfaces, with or without an assistive device.
    *   Improve balance and coordination to safely navigate common environmental obstacles (e.g., doorways).
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):**
    *   Achieve modified independence in basic ADLs (feeding, grooming, dressing, toileting).
    *   Regain urinary continence.
*   **Social Participation:**
    *   Re-engage in simple social interactions with family and therapists.

### 2. Treatment Methods

#### **I. Physical Therapy (PT)**
*   **Balance Training:**
    *   Start with static sitting balance training on a firm surface, progressing to dynamic sitting activities (e.g., reaching for objects).
    *   Introduce sitting on unstable surfaces (e.g., therapy ball with support) as stability improves.
    *   Utilize a tilt table for gradual acclimatization to upright posture and weight-bearing.
    *   Progress to standing balance training in parallel bars with manual support, focusing on weight shifting.
*   **Strength Training:**
    *   Active-assistive and active range of motion exercises for all four limbs to improve muscle strength and prevent atrophy.
    *   Progressive resistance exercises using therapy bands and light weights, with a focus on core stabilizers, gluteal, and quadriceps muscles.
    *   Targeted strengthening for the weaker left side.
*   **Mobility & Transfer Training:**
    *   Bed mobility training: rolling, bridging, and moving from supine to sitting.
    *   Transfer training (e.g., sit-to-stand, bed-to-chair) using proper techniques and appropriate levels of assistance to ensure safety.
*   **Coordination Training:**
    *   Simple, repetitive coordination exercises for limbs (e.g., tapping, sliding heel on shin) to address ataxia, performed in supported positions initially.
*   **Prevention:**
    *   Regular passive range of motion exercises to prevent joint contractures.
    *   Positioning schedule to prevent pressure sores.

#### **II. Occupational Therapy (OT)**
*   **Cognitive & Behavioral Rehabilitation:**
    *   **Environmental Management:** Provide a structured, low-stimulation environment to reduce confusion and agitation. Maintain a consistent daily schedule.
    *   **Orientation Training:** Frequent re-orientation to person, place, and time using clocks, calendars, and verbal cues.
    *   **Attention Training:** Begin with short-duration, simple, and motivating tasks. Gradually increase complexity and duration as tolerated.
    *   **Behavioral Management:** Employ a calm, reassuring approach. Use simple, direct commands. Redirect inappropriate behaviors rather than confronting them.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training:**
    *   Break down ADL tasks (grooming, dressing, self-feeding) into simple, manageable steps.
    *   Utilize chaining and hand-over-hand assistance to facilitate participation.
*   **Upper Limb Functional Training:**
    *   Task-oriented training to improve functional use of both upper limbs, addressing the strength deficit and ataxia in the left arm.
    *   Bilateral activities to promote motor planning and coordination.
    *   Grip strength training using putty and grippers.
*   **Sensory Re-education:**
    *   Provide sensory stimulation (e.g., different textures, temperatures) to the left side of the face to address numbness.

#### **III. Speech-Language Pathology (SLP)**
*   **Swallowing Therapy (Dysphagia Management):**
    *   Maintain strict NPO (nothing by mouth) status until a safe swallow is established.
    *   Implement oral motor exercises to improve strength, range of motion, and coordination of labial, lingual, and pharyngeal muscles.
    *   Provide thermal-tactile stimulation to heighten sensory awareness and trigger the swallow reflex.
    *   When appropriate, and possibly guided by a Video Fluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS), begin controlled swallowing trials with ice chips or thickened liquids.
*   **Language Therapy (Aphasia):**
    *   Establish a functional communication system (e.g., communication board with pictures/words, gestures, consistent head nods).
    *   Work on improving auditory comprehension of simple, concrete commands and questions.
    *   Drills for simple naming and word retrieval as language emerges.
*   **Speech Therapy (Dysarthria):**
    *   Respiratory support exercises (e.g., deep breathing, sustained vowel sounds) to improve vocal volume and breath control.
    *   Oral motor exercises to improve strength and precision of articulators (lips, tongue, jaw).
    *   Introduce pacing and over-articulation strategies to improve speech clarity.

#### **IV. General Medical & Nursing Management**
*   **Nutritional Support:** Continue nasogastric tube feeding as prescribed. Consult with a dietitian to ensure adequate caloric and protein intake for healing and to address weight loss.
*   **Pulmonary Care:** Encourage deep breathing and coughing exercises. Monitor respiratory status closely to manage and prevent further pulmonary infection.
*   **Medication Management:** Continue antiviral therapy for Hepatitis B and monitor liver function. Consider pharmacotherapy for sleep regulation if non-pharmacological methods are insufficient.
*   **Bladder & Bowel Management:** Implement a timed voiding schedule to begin bladder retraining. Monitor bowel movements to prevent constipation.
*   **Psychological Support & Family Education:**
    *   Provide supportive counseling for the patient's depressed mood and affective flattening.
    *   Educate the family about Traumatic Brain Injury, the RLA scale, and the purpose of the rehabilitation plan. Teach them effective communication strategies and how to assist safely.

**Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** A mandatory weekly team conference will be held with all treating disciplines (Physician, PT, OT, SLP, Nursing, Dietitian) to review progress, update goals, and ensure a coordinated and integrated approach to the patient's care.
