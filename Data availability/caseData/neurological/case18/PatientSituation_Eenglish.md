## I. Case Summary

**Patient Information**: Male, 47 years old.

**Chief Complaint**: Limb movement impairment and cognitive decline 5 weeks post-traumatic brain injury.

**Present Illness**:  
On the night of March 28, 2023, the patient fell down stairs after alcohol consumption, striking his head and losing consciousness. He was transferred to a local hospital. CT revealed bilateral frontoparietal intracerebral hemorrhage. Due to worsening cerebral edema, he underwent "intracranial hematoma evacuation + decompressive craniectomy" on March 31, 2023. On postoperative day 2, he regained consciousness with spontaneous eye opening but exhibited no spontaneous speech. He was unable to respond to questions or follow simple commands. Water aspiration and generalized limb weakness (inability to lift limbs off bed surface) were noted. Transferred to Huashan Hospital on April 17, 2023 for recurrent fever. After infection control, he was admitted to the Rehabilitation Medicine Department on May 4, 2023. Since onset, he has exhibited lethargy, depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and significant weight loss. Indwelling nasogastric tube, urinary catheter, and PICC line present.

**Past Medical History**:  
HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B for 15 years, maintained on entecavir antiviral therapy with stable disease. Smoking history >20 years (10 cigarettes/day), alcohol consumption >10 years (100ml liquor/day). Denies history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, or drug allergies.

**Physical Examination**:  
Temp 36.6°C, Pulse 93 bpm, RR 20/min, BP 122/78 mmHg. Conscious, moderate nutrition, wheelchair-bound. Bilateral coarse breath sounds with scant rales and moist crackles. Cardiac and abdominal examinations unremarkable.

**Neurological Examination**:  
Conscious, apathetic affect. Minimal spontaneous speech with dysarthria and hypophonia. Unable to respond to questions. Significant impairment in short/long-term memory and calculation. Pupils isocoric (≈3mm diameter), brisk light reflex, no nystagmus. Bilateral symmetric forehead wrinkles, intact eyelid closure. Decreased pain/touch sensation and numbness over left face. Left nasolabial fold flattening, rightward deviation on smiling, leftward tongue protrusion. Bilateral diminished gag reflex, uvula midline. Muscle strength: Left upper/lower limbs 4-, Right upper/lower limbs 4. Unstable standing. Left dysmetria during finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests. Intact superficial/deep sensation in limbs. Biceps/brachioradialis reflexes (++), patellar/achilles reflexes (++). Bilateral Babinski(+), Chaddock(+).

**Diagnostic Tests**:
*   **Preoperative Head CT (Mar 28, 2023)**: Bilateral frontoparietal intracerebral hemorrhage. Multiple left temporal lobe contusions. Subarachnoid hemorrhage. Left occipital epidural hematoma. Left occipital bone fracture. Right occipital scalp hematoma.
*   **Postoperative Head MRI (May 7, 2023)**: Post-traumatic changes in bilateral frontal and left temporal lobes with multiple hemorrhagic foci. Bilateral frontoparietal small ischemic lesions.

**Diagnosis**: Postoperative craniocerebral trauma.
*   **Localization**: Bilateral frontal lobes, left temporal lobe.
*   **Etiology**: Traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral contusion.
*   **Comorbidities**: Pulmonary infection, Chronic hepatitis B virus infection (HBeAg-positive).

**Functional Impairments**:
1.  Motor impairment
2.  Balance impairment
3.  Cognitive impairment
4.  Speech impairment
5.  Dysphagia
6.  Left central facial palsy
7.  Sleep disturbance
8.  Neurobehavioral impairment
9.  Activities of Daily Living (ADL) limitation
10. Social participation restriction
