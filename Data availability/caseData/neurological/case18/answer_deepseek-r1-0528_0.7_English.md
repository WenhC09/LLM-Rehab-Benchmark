### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan  

#### 1. Rehabilitation Goals  
**Short-term Goals (4–6 weeks):**  
- **Swallowing:** Achieve safe oral intake (Yanagihara Grade ≤2) to remove nasogastric tube.  
- **Mobility:** Attain independent sitting balance (Level 3), stand with minimal assistance (Berg ≥36).  
- **Communication:** Respond to simple yes/no questions (WAB AQ ≥20).  
- **Cognition:** Follow 1-step commands (MoCA ≥10).  
- **ADLs:** Perform basic self-care (modified feeding, hygiene) with moderate assistance (MBI ≥45).  
- **Complication Prevention:** Resolve pulmonary infection, prevent contractures/spasticity.  

**Long-term Goals (3–6 months):**  
- **Functional Independence:** Ambulate 50m with assistive device, manage ADLs with minimal supervision (MBI ≥75).  
- **Communication:** Use simple phrases for daily needs (WAB AQ ≥50).  
- **Cognition:** Complete 2-step commands, orient to time/person (MoCA ≥18).  
- **Swallowing:** Tolerate full oral diet without aspiration.  
- **Community Reintegration:** Participate in family/social activities with support.

#### 2. Treatment Methods  
**A. Motor & Balance Rehabilitation**  
- **Gait Training:** Partial weight-bearing treadmill + parallel bar exercises; progress to quad cane.  
- **Strength Training:**  
  - Left limbs: Resistance bands (shoulder abduction, elbow extension; 3×15 reps).  
  - Right limbs: Progressive weights (hip/knee flexion; 3×10 reps).  
- **Balance:** Seated ball toss → standing weight shifts → perturbation training.  
- **Coordination:** Left upper limb: Frenkel’s exercises (tabletop tracing).  

**B. Cognitive & Behavioral Therapy**  
- **Attention Training:** Computerized tasks (e.g., digit span, visual tracking) 20 min/day.  
- **Memory Aids:** External supports (memory notebook + smartphone alerts).  
- **Executive Function:** Simple problem-solving (e.g., sorting objects by category).  
- **Behavior Management:** Structured routines + redirection for agitation (RLA IV).  

**C. Speech & Swallowing Therapy**  
- **Dysarthria:** Respiratory training (diaphragmatic breathing) + oral motor exercises (lip/tongue resistance).  
- **Aphasia:** Melodic intonation therapy for functional phrases (e.g., "water," "help").  
- **Dysphagia:**  
  - Compensatory: Chin tuck during swallowing.  
  - Therapeutic: Masako maneuver, thermal-tactile stimulation.  
  - Diet: Honey-thick liquids → pureed solids under videofluoroscopy guidance.  

**D. ADL & Self-Care Training**  
- **Task-Specific Training:**  
  - Upper limbs: Dressing with adaptive aids (button hook).  
  - Feeding: Modified utensils for self-feeding.  
- **Toileting:** Scheduled voiding to remove urinary catheter.  

**E. Comorbidity Management**  
- **Pulmonary Infection:**  
  - Postural drainage + percussion 2×/day.  
  - Incentive spirometry (goal: 1500 ml).  
- **Hepatitis B:** Monitor liver function; strict universal precautions for therapists.  

**F. Ancillary Interventions**  
- **Spasticity Prevention:** Daily ROM exercises (all joints) + positioning (arm trough for wheelchair).  
- **Sleep Hygiene:** Fixed sleep schedule, limit daytime napping, relaxation techniques.  
- **Psychological Support:** Patient/family education on TBI recovery; low-dose SSRIs if mood persists.  

**G. Safety & Precautions**  
- **Fall Risk:** Hip protector + bed alarms; 1:1 supervision during mobility.  
- **Aspiration Risk:** NPO until Yanagihara ≤3; monitor O₂ saturation during meals.  
- **Infection Control:** PICC line care protocol; isolate if febrile.
