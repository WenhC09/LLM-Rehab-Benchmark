# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4-8 weeks):
- Improve sitting balance to level 2 and achieve assisted standing balance.
- Increase bilateral upper limb muscle strength to 4+/5 and grip strength by 10%.
- Enhance cognitive function to RLA Level V, improving MoCA score to 10-12 points.
- Improve speech clarity and fluency, targeting WAB AQ score of 10-12 points.
- Advance swallowing function to Water Swallowing Test Level 3, reducing aspiration risk.
- Improve MBI score to 30-35 points for enhanced ADL independence.
- Stabilize mood and improve sleep quality through non-pharmacological interventions.

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- independent standing and assisted ambulation with assistive devices.
- Restore bilateral upper limb muscle strength to 5/5 and normalize grip strength.
- Attain RLA Level VI-VII, with MoCA score approaching 18-20 points.
- Achieve functional communication with WAB AQ score of 20-25 points.
- Restore safe oral feeding (Water Swallowing Test Level 1-2) and remove nasogastric tube.
- Reach MBI score of 50-60 points, enabling partial independence in ADLs.
- Facilitate social reintegration through improved neurobehavioral regulation and community participation.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Motor and Balance Rehabilitation
- **Physical Therapy (5 sessions/week, 45 min/session)**:
  - **Core and trunk strengthening**: Seated exercises (e.g., pelvic tilts, trunk rotations) to improve sitting balance to level 2.
  - **Upper limb training**: Progressive resistance exercises using elastic bands and light weights (1-2 kg) to target 4+/5 strength in bilateral upper limbs.
  - **Lower limb training**: Assisted standing exercises with parallel bars and tilt table to promote weight-bearing and improve standing stability.
  - **Balance training**: Seated balance tasks (e.g., reaching exercises) progressing to standing with support, guided by Berg Balance Scale improvements.
  - **Coordination exercises**: Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tasks to address left-sided dysmetria, 10-15 min/session.

### Cognitive Rehabilitation
- **Cognitive Therapy (4 sessions/week, 30 min/session)**:
  - **Attention training**: Computer-based tasks (e.g., sustained attention exercises) to improve RLA level and MoCA scores.
  - **Memory training**: Repetitive recall tasks (e.g., word lists, daily schedules) to enhance short-term memory.
  - **Executive function training**: Simple problem-solving activities (e.g., sequencing tasks) to improve planning and calculation skills.
  - **Environmental modifications**: Structured, low-distraction settings to support cognitive engagement.

### Speech and Swallowing Rehabilitation
- **Speech-Language Therapy (5 sessions/week, 30 min/session)**:
  - **Dysarthria treatment**: Oral motor exercises (e.g., lip/tongue strengthening) and articulation drills to improve speech clarity, targeting Frenchay Dysarthria score improvement.
  - **Aphasia therapy**: Melodic intonation therapy and constraint-induced language therapy to enhance WAB AQ score.
  - **Swallowing therapy**: Thermal-tactile stimulation and effortful swallowing exercises to improve Water Swallowing Test to Level 3. Supervised trials with thickened liquids to reduce aspiration risk.

### Dysphagia Management
- **Dietary Modifications**:
  - Continue nasogastric tube feeding with gradual introduction of thickened liquids (Level 3 consistency) under speech therapist supervision.
  - Nutritional monitoring to address weight loss, ensuring 2000-2200 kcal/day and adequate protein intake (1.2 g/kg/day).

### Neurobehavioral and Psychological Support
- **Psychological Intervention (2 sessions/week, 30 min/session)**:
  - **Behavioral therapy**: Positive reinforcement and structured routines to address apathy and improve engagement.
  - **Sleep hygiene education**: Establish consistent sleep schedules, limit daytime napping, and create a calm sleep environment to address sleep disturbances.
  - **Caregiver counseling**: Train family on supportive communication strategies to reduce patient frustration and enhance mood.

### Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training
- **Occupational Therapy (4 sessions/week, 45 min/session)**:
  - **Self-care training**: Assisted feeding, grooming, and dressing tasks to improve MBI score.
  - **Adaptive equipment**: Introduce utensils with built-up handles and wheelchair modifications to enhance independence.
  - **Functional task practice**: Repetitive task training (e.g., buttoning, transfers) to improve ARAT scores and ADL performance.

### Additional Interventions
- **Medical Management**:
  - Continue entecavir for chronic hepatitis B, with regular liver function monitoring.
  - Monitor and treat pulmonary infection with antibiotics as needed, alongside chest physiotherapy (e.g., postural drainage, 2 sessions/day) to clear rales.
  - Regular assessment of PICC line and urinary catheter to prevent infections; plan for removal when feasible.
- **Assistive Devices**:
  - Provide a high-back wheelchair with pressure-relieving cushion for mobility and comfort.
  - Consider ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) for left lower limb to support standing exercises.
- **Team Coordination**:
  - Weekly multidisciplinary team meetings (physician, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, psychologist, and nurse) to monitor progress and adjust interventions.
  - Family education sessions to support home-based care and transition planning.

### Monitoring and Evaluation
- Reassess weekly: Muscle strength (MRC scale), Berg Balance Scale, MBI, and Water Swallowing Test.
-assess biweekly: MoCA, WAB, and Frenchay Dysarthria scores to track cognitive and speech progress.
- Adjust treatment intensity and goals based on progress, with formal re-evaluation at 4 weeks.
