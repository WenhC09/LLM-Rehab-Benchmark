# 1. Rehabilitation Goals
**Short-term Goals:**
Implement comprehensive arousal therapy to promote recovery of consciousness level.

**Long-term Goals:**
Restore patient's ability for independent activities of daily living (ADL) and social participation.

# 2. Therapeutic Interventions
### Comprehensive Arousal Therapy Protocol for Disorders of Consciousness:
1.  **Pharmacotherapy**:
    *   Weeks 1-2: Oral Amantadine 100mg twice daily.
    *   Week 3: Oral Amantadine 150mg twice daily.
2.  **Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)**:
    *   Parameters: 2.0 ATA (absolute atmosphere), 99% oxygen concentration, oxygen flow rate 6L/min, single oxygen inhalation duration 60 minutes.
    *   Cycle: Once daily. 10 sessions constitute 1 course. After 2 courses, rest for 5 days before initiating the 3rd course.
3.  **Median Nerve Electrical Stimulation (MNES)**:
    *   Stimulation Site: Skin electrodes placed over the median nerve at the wrist, 2cm proximal to the palmar wrist crease.
    *   Parameters: Square wave, current intensity 15-20mA (adjusted until slight finger contraction observed), pulse width 300Î¼s, frequency 50Hz. Stimulate for 20 seconds followed by 40 seconds rest.
    *   Frequency: Once daily.
4.  **Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)**:
    *   Stimulation Site: Bilateral M1 area (Primary Motor Cortex).
    *   Stimulation Frequency: 10Hz.
    *   Treatment Frequency: Once daily.

### Post-Arousal Rehabilitation Protocol for Cognitive and Motor Dysfunction:
#### 1. Enriched Rehabilitation Training (For Mild Cognitive Impairment)
1.  **Multisensory Stimulation**:
    *   **Visual Stimulation**: Provide internet-based reading materials/videos of patient's interest. 10 minutes/session, once daily.
    *   **Olfactory Stimulation**: Patient attempts to distinguish between two different perfumes/scents with therapist correction. Scents changed daily. 3 minutes/session, once daily.
    *   **Tactile Stimulation**: Patient palpates various objects (differing in shape, size, texture) concealed in a bag using the affected hand (without visual input), then names/describes them with therapist correction. 10 minutes/session, once daily.
    *   **Motor Stimulation**: Utilize virtual reality (VR) and motorized treadmill for lower limb activities (e.g., simulated hiking, mushroom picking, skiing games). Utilize modeling clay and painting for upper limb activities. Active participation of affected limb required; unaffected limb may assist. 20 minutes/session, once daily.
2.  **Cognitive Activities**:
    *   Utilize VR for complex tasks integrating multiple cognitive functions. 40 minutes/session, once daily.
    *   **Simulated Supermarket Shopping**: Purchase specified brands/quantities from a memorized shopping list within a time limit in a virtual supermarket.
    *   **Simulated Classroom Lecture**: Attend/listen to simulated lectures, potentially with distractions (noise, birds). Therapist quizzes on content post-session.
    *   **Card Games**: Identify patterns (shape, color, quantity) in 3 therapist-arranged cards and select/place the 4th matching card.
3.  **Social Activities**:
    *   Encourage verbal interaction with therapists/other patients during other therapies.
    *   Organize group card/board games and recreational activities.
    *   Facilitate group discussions on current social topics among multiple patients.
    *   Duration: 40 minutes/session, once daily.

#### 2. Motor Function Training (For Bilateral Hemiplegia & Post-amputation Motor Dysfunction)
1.  **Prosthetic Fitting**: Fit patient with temporary prosthesis for functional training.
2.  **Muscle Strength Training**: Strengthen muscles of bilateral hemiplegic limbs and residual limbs.
3.  **Balance Training**: Implement static and dynamic standing balance exercises.
4.  **Transfer Training**: Practice bed-to-chair transfers, progressing towards assisted standing and independent transfers.
