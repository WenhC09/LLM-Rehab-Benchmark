### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

#### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

**Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks):**
- Improve consciousness level to Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score ≥12.
- Enhance cognitive function to achieve Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score ≥26.
- Increase muscle strength in right lower limb and left upper limb to grade 4.
- Improve left elbow joint range of motion by 20–30 degrees.
- Achieve partial independence in basic activities of daily living (ADL) with Modified Barthel Index score ≥20.
- Prevent secondary complications (e.g., pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, contractures).
- Optimize nutritional status and maintain stable weight via nasogastric feeding.

**Long-term Goals (3–6 months):**
- Achieve full consciousness with consistent responsiveness to verbal commands.
- Restore cognitive function to near-normal levels (MoCA score ≥28).
- Attain muscle strength grade 5 in right lower limb and left upper limb.
- Maximize left elbow joint mobility to functional range for ADL.
- Achieve modified independence in ADL (Modified Barthel Index score ≥60).
- Facilitate prosthetic fitting for left lower limb and initiate gait training.
- Promote social reintegration through community-based rehabilitation and vocational training.

#### 2. Treatment Methods

**a. Neurological Rehabilitation for Consciousness and Cognitive Dysfunction**
- **Sensory Stimulation Therapy**: Daily 30-minute sessions including auditory (familiar voices, music), tactile (gentle massage, textured objects), and visual stimuli (bright lights, moving objects) to enhance arousal and responsiveness.
- **Cognitive Training**: 
  - 20-minute sessions, 5 days/week, focusing on attention and memory exercises (e.g., digit span tasks, picture recognition).
  - Use of Stroop Color-Word Test exercises to improve executive function, starting with 10-minute sessions, 3 days/week.
- **Pharmacological Support**: Coordinate with neurologist for potential use of neurostimulants (e.g., amantadine or methylphenidate) to enhance consciousness, if deemed appropriate.
- **Environmental Enrichment**: Provide a structured, low-stimulation environment to reduce confusion, with gradual introduction of family interaction to support emotional and cognitive recovery.

**b. Physical Rehabilitation for Motor Dysfunction and Hemiparesis**
- **Passive Range of Motion (PROM) Exercises**: 
  - Left elbow: Gentle PROM exercises, 15 minutes twice daily, to prevent further stiffness and improve joint mobility.
  - Right lower limb: PROM to maintain joint flexibility, 10 minutes twice daily.
- **Active-Assisted Range of Motion (AAROM) Exercises**: 
  - Left upper limb and right lower limb: 20-minute sessions, 5 days/week, to improve muscle strength to grade 4, using therapist-assisted movements progressing to active exercises.
- **Strength Training**: 
  - Right lower limb: Low-resistance exercises (e.g., ankle weights, 0.5–1 kg), 3 sets of 10 repetitions, 4 days/week.
  - Left upper limb: Hand-held weights (0.5 kg), 3 sets of 10 repetitions, 4 days/week, focusing on biceps and triceps.
- **Positioning and Postural Training**: 
  - Proper positioning in bed/wheelchair to prevent contractures and pressure ulcers, with repositioning every 2 hours.
  - Use of splints for left elbow to maintain functional position during rest.

**c. Management of Left Lower Limb Amputation**
- **Stump Care and Conditioning**: 
  - Daily inspection and cleaning of left thigh stump to ensure wound healing and prevent infection.
  - Stump wrapping with elastic bandages to shape the stump for prosthetic fitting, 2–3 times daily.
- **Desensitization Therapy**: Gentle tapping and massage of the stump, 10 minutes daily, to reduce phantom limb pain and improve tolerance to touch.
- **Pre-Prosthetic Training**: 
  - Strengthening exercises for hip adductors and abductors (right side and residual left limb), 3 sets of 10 repetitions, 4 days/week.
  - Balance training in sitting position using therapy ball, 15 minutes, 3 days/week, to prepare for prosthetic use.

**d. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training**
- **Task-Specific Training**: 
  - Begin with simple tasks (e.g., self-feeding with adaptive utensils, grooming), 20 minutes daily, guided by occupational therapist.
  - Use of adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled reachers) to compensate for left elbow stiffness and hemiparesis.
- **Transfer Training**: Practice bed-to-wheelchair transfers with maximal assistance, progressing to moderate assistance, 10 minutes daily.

**e. Respiratory and General Medical Management**
- **Respiratory Therapy**: 
  - Tracheostomy care and suctioning as needed to maintain airway patency.
  - Breathing exercises (e.g., diaphragmatic breathing), 10 minutes twice daily, to improve respiratory muscle strength and wean off tracheostomy dependence.
- **Nutritional Support**: 
  - Continue nasogastric semi-liquid diet, ensuring 2000–2500 kcal/day and adequate protein (1.2–1.5 g/kg/day) to support tissue repair and muscle recovery.
  - Monitor for signs of aspiration; coordinate with speech therapist for swallowing assessment if consciousness improves.
- **Complication Prevention**: 
  - Daily skin assessments to prevent pressure ulcers, with use of pressure-relieving mattresses.
  - Prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin (as per medical team’s prescription) to prevent deep vein thrombosis.
  - Monitor renal function and electrolytes, coordinating with nephrologist for ongoing hemodialysis needs.

**f. Psychosocial and Family Support**
- **Psychological Support**: Weekly counseling sessions for family to address emotional stress and educate them on patient’s condition and rehabilitation process.
- **Social Participation Planning**: Begin discussions with social worker for long-term community reintegration, including accessibility modifications and vocational rehabilitation options.

**g. Monitoring and Reassessment**
- Weekly reassessments of GCS, MoCA, and muscle strength to adjust treatment intensity.
- Monthly reevaluation of Modified Barthel Index to track ADL progress.
- Coordinate with multidisciplinary team (neurologist, nephrologist, occupational therapist, physical therapist, speech therapist) for integrated care.
