## Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-term goals (within 4–6 weeks)
1. Improve level of consciousness and orientation through structured sensory stimulation.
2. Maintain and improve joint range of motion in all limbs, prevent contractures, and manage left elbow stiffness.
3. Enhance sitting balance and trunk control to prepare for further mobility training.
4. Promote gradual improvement of muscle strength in the left upper limb and right lower limb (target: at least one grade improvement).
5. Facilitate tolerance to upright sitting and initial wheelchair positioning.
6. Maintain integrity of left lower limb stump, prevent infection, and prepare for future prosthetic fitting.
7. Improve swallowing safety and gradually transition from nasogastric feeding to partial oral intake if feasible.
8. Begin structured cognitive training to improve attention, memory, and executive function.
9. Educate caregivers in safe handling, positioning, and home exercise program.

#### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
1. Achieve basic independence in bed mobility, transfers, and wheelchair propulsion.
2. Achieve independence in basic self-care tasks (feeding, grooming, upper body dressing) with adaptive strategies.
3. Attain sufficient stump healing and conditioning for prosthetic trial fitting and gait training.
4. Enhance cognitive function toward MoCA ≥ 26, enabling safe participation in community and vocational activities.
5. Improve bilateral limb strength to at least grade 4, enabling basic functional ambulation with prosthesis and assistive device.
6. Maximize social participation and reintegration into family and community life.

### 2. Treatment Methods

**A. Medical Management Support**
- Continue monitoring of vital signs, fluid-electrolyte balance, and renal function.
- Stump care with regular inspection, hygiene, and compression bandaging to shape and shrink the stump.
- Pain management, particularly for phantom limb pain if present.
- Prevention and treatment of infections, especially at tracheostomy site and stump.

**B. Physical Therapy**
1. **Positioning & Passive Range of Motion (PROM):**
   - Daily PROM for all limbs, with gentle mobilization of left elbow to address stiffness.
   - Use of splints or orthoses for contracture prevention if needed.
2. **Bed Mobility & Postural Control Training:**
   - Gradual progression from supine to supported sitting at bedside, then unsupported sitting.
   - Trunk stabilization exercises.
3. **Muscle Strengthening:**
   - Active-assisted and active exercises for left upper limb and right lower limb.
   - Resistive exercises for right upper limb to maintain strength.
4. **Balance & Coordination:**
   - Sitting balance training with gradual challenge progression.
5. **Amputation-Specific Training:**
   - Stump desensitization and strengthening of proximal muscles.
   - Education on proper positioning to prevent hip flexion contracture.
6. **Respiratory Function Maintenance:**
   - Breathing exercises through tracheostomy tube, assisted coughing techniques.

**C. Occupational Therapy**
1. **ADL Training:**
   - Task-specific training for grooming, feeding, dressing (adaptive methods for one-legged mobility).
   - Use of assistive devices and environmental modifications.
2. **Upper Limb Function:**
   - Fine motor coordination exercises for left hand.
   - Functional reaching and grasping tasks.
3. **Cognitive Rehabilitation:**
   - Attention, working memory, and problem-solving exercises.
   - Structured daily routine to enhance orientation and independence.

**D. Speech and Swallowing Therapy**
- Swallowing assessment and graduated diet texture trials.
- Oral-motor exercises to improve strength and coordination.
- Communication training to improve verbal output if speech is affected by cognitive deficits.

**E. Sensory Stimulation Program**
- Multimodal sensory stimulation (auditory, visual, tactile, proprioceptive) to enhance arousal and consciousness recovery.

**F. Psychological Support**
- Early psychological counseling for patient (as cognition improves) and family.
- Education on coping strategies and stress management.

**G. Assistive Technology**
- Introduction to wheelchair mobility, stump protectors, and adaptive devices for self-care.
- Consider early consultation with prosthetics team for future planning.

**H. Caregiver Training**
- Transfer techniques, safe handling, prevention of pressure sores.
- Home exercise program and stimulation activities.

**I. Interdisciplinary Coordination**
- Regular team meetings involving rehabilitation physician, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, nurse, prosthetist, and psychologist to adjust plan based on progress.
