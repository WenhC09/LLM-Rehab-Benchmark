### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

#### Rehabilitation Goals:
- **Short-term goals:**
  1. Improve consciousness level and cognitive function to facilitate communication and engagement in rehabilitation activities.
  2. Enhance left upper limb strength and function to promote independence in daily activities.
  3. Prevent complications related to immobility, such as pressure sores and contractures.

- **Long-term goals:**
  1. Achieve maximum functional independence in activities of daily living (ADL) as assessed by the Modified Barthel Index.
  2. Facilitate social participation and reintegration into the community.
  3. Optimize mobility and functional use of the right lower limb and left upper limb.

#### Treatment Methods:
1. **Cognitive Rehabilitation:**
   - Implement a structured cognitive rehabilitation program focusing on attention, memory, and executive function using tasks tailored to the patient's cognitive level.
   - Utilize visual and auditory stimuli to enhance awareness and responsiveness.

2. **Physical Rehabilitation:**
   - Initiate passive range of motion (ROM) exercises for the left upper limb and right lower limb to maintain joint mobility and prevent stiffness.
   - Progress to active-assisted exercises for the left upper limb as tolerated, focusing on improving muscle strength and coordination.
   - Incorporate functional training for the right lower limb to enhance weight-bearing and balance.

3. **Occupational Therapy:**
   - Engage the patient in adaptive techniques for self-care tasks to promote independence, focusing on the use of the right upper limb.
   - Introduce assistive devices as needed to facilitate participation in ADL.

4. **Speech and Language Therapy:**
   - Assess and address any communication deficits, providing strategies to improve verbal and non-verbal communication skills.
   - Implement swallowing assessments and interventions to ensure safe oral intake as the patient progresses.

5. **Multidisciplinary Team Approach:**
   - Collaborate with physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and nursing staff to ensure a comprehensive rehabilitation approach.
   - Regularly review and adjust the rehabilitation plan based on the patient's progress and emerging needs.

6. **Psychosocial Support:**
   - Provide psychological support to the patient and family to address emotional and social challenges related to the traumatic injury and rehabilitation process.
   - Facilitate family involvement in rehabilitation to enhance motivation and support.

7. **Monitoring and Evaluation:**
   - Conduct regular assessments of cognitive, motor, and functional progress using standardized tools (e.g., MoCA, Barthel Index).
   - Adjust treatment methods based on ongoing evaluations and patient feedback to optimize rehabilitation outcomes.
