### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

#### 1. Rehabilitation Goals
**Short-term goals (4-8 weeks):**
- Improve consciousness level to consistent command-following (GCS ≥12)
- Prevent contractures in left elbow and right lower limb joints
- Achieve stump maturation for prosthetic fitting (left thigh)
- Establish basic bed mobility (bridging, rolling)
- Initiate tracheostomy weaning protocol
- Maintain skin integrity (pressure ulcer prevention)

**Long-term goals (6-12 months):**
- Achieve independent transfers and wheelchair mobility
- Ambulate with prosthetic limb and single-point cane
- Regain independence in basic ADLs (feeding, grooming)
- Improve cognitive function to near-baseline (MoCA ≥26)
- Complete tracheostomy decannulation
- Return to modified community activities

#### 2. Treatment Methods
**Neurological Rehabilitation:**
- **Sensory stimulation program**: Multimodal input (auditory, tactile, visual) 30min BID
- **Coma recovery scale-guided therapy**: Structured arousal protocol with familiar stimuli
- **Cognitive retraining**: Errorless learning for attention/executive functions using computer-based tasks (Stroop, digit span)

**Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation:**
- **Stump management**: 
  - Compression shaping (shrinker sock) 
  - Desensitization massage
  - Progressive weight-bearing training
- **Joint mobility**: 
  - Left elbow PROM/AAROM (3x/day) with dynamic splinting
  - Right lower limb strengthening (quad sets, SLR with ankle weights)
- **Brachial plexus protocol**: 
  - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to left upper limb 
  - Mirror therapy for sensorimotor re-education

**Functional Training:**
- **Bed mobility program**: 
  - Log-roll training with bed rails 
  - Bridging exercises with resistance bands
- **Pre-prosthetic training**: 
  - Sitting balance on edge of bed 
  - Single-limb standing (right) parallel bars
- **ADL re-education**: 
  - Adaptive feeding techniques (rocking knife)
  - Toileting with overhead trapeze

**Adjunctive Therapies:**
- **Respiratory management**: 
  - Cough assist device + incentive spirometry QID
  - Passy-Muir valve trials for phonation
- **Pain control**: 
  - TENS for phantom limb pain 
  - Stump edema management (elevation protocol)
- **Nutritional optimization**: 
  - High-protein diet (1.5g/kg) via NG tube 
  - Vitamin D/calcium supplementation

**Monitoring Parameters:**
- Daily GCS tracking
- Weekly stump circumference measurements
- Biweekly ROM assessment (left elbow/right ankle)
- Monthly MoCA reassessment
- Skin integrity checks during all position changes
