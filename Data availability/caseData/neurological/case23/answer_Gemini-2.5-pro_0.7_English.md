    *   Achieve independent static and dynamic sitting balance for >10 minutes without support.
    *   Master bed mobility (rolling, bridging, moving from supine to sitting) with minimal assistance.
*   **Stump & Prosthetic Readiness:**
    *   Achieve a well-shaped, non-tender stump through consistent compression wrapping.
    *   Patient to tolerate stump desensitization techniques (tapping, varied textures) without adverse reaction.
    *   Demonstrate Grade 4/5 strength in left hip extensors and abductors.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):**
    *   Achieve independence in feeding once oral intake is deemed safe.
    *   Perform upper body grooming and dressing with minimal assistance and use of adaptive strategies.
    *   Initiate a swallowing assessment to create a plan for weaning from the nasogastric tube.
    *   Collaborate with the medical team on a tracheostomy weaning protocol.
*   **Mobility:**
    *   Perform bed-to-wheelchair transfers with moderate assistance, using a sliding board.

**Long-term goals (Next 3-6 months):**

*   **Cognition:**
    *   Achieve a MoCA score of â‰¥26, indicating a return to baseline cognitive function.
    *   Independently use compensatory strategies (e.g., memory aids, planners) to manage residual cognitive deficits in daily life.
*   **Motor Function:**
    *   Achieve full, pain-free active range of motion in the left elbow.
    *   Attain Grade 5/5 muscle strength in the right upper and lower limbs, and Grade 4+/5 in the left upper limb.
*   **Mobility & Ambulation:**
    *   Achieve independent transfers between all relevant surfaces (bed, wheelchair, toilet).
    *   Successfully fit with a left transfemoral prosthesis.
    *   Achieve independent, safe ambulation with the prosthesis and an appropriate assistive device (e.g., walker or crutches) on indoor surfaces and gentle slopes.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):**
    *   Achieve modified independence (requiring only assistive devices or increased time) in all personal ADLs, including bathing and lower body dressing.
*   **Social & Vocational:**
    *   Return to community participation.
    *   Undergo a vocational assessment to explore options for returning to work or pursuing new vocational interests.

#### 2. Treatment Methods

A multidisciplinary approach will be implemented, involving the following therapies:

**Physical Therapy (PT):**

*   **Neuromuscular Re-education:** Task-oriented training for the left upper limb and right lower limb to improve motor control and functional movement patterns.
*   **Strength Training:**
    *   Progressive resistive exercises for all four limbs, with a focus on the left upper limb (brachial plexus injury) and right lower limb (hemiparesis).
    *   Intensive core stability and trunk control exercises to provide a stable base for limb movement and prosthetic use.
*   **Range of Motion (ROM) Therapy:** Active, active-assisted, and passive ROM exercises for the left elbow, supplemented with joint mobilization techniques to address stiffness.
*   **Balance & Mobility Training:**
    *   Progressive sitting and standing balance exercises (initially in parallel bars).
    *   Bed mobility and transfer training, gradually reducing assistance and phasing out the sliding board.
*   **Stump Management:**
    *   **Shaping:** Instruction and application of elastic compression wrapping to achieve a conical shape for optimal prosthetic fit.
    *   **Desensitization:** Graded sensory stimulation (rubbing, tapping) to reduce hypersensitivity.
    *   **Strengthening:** Targeted exercises for the left hip musculature (abductors, adductors, flexors, extensors) to control a future prosthesis.
*   **Pre-Prosthetic Gait Training:** Ambulation in parallel bars using the right leg to improve strength, endurance, and balance in preparation for prosthetic gait.

**Occupational Therapy (OT):**

*   **Cognitive Rehabilitation:**
    *   Targeted computer-based and functional tasks to improve attention (Attention Process Training), processing speed, and executive function (planning, sequencing daily tasks).
    *   Training in the use of compensatory tools like daily planners, smartphone reminders, and checklists.
*   **ADL Retraining:**
    *   One-handed techniques for dressing, grooming, and self-care.
    *   Training with adaptive equipment as needed (e.g., button hook, sock aid).
    *   Energy conservation and work simplification strategies.
*   **Upper Extremity Therapy:**
    *   Functional electrical stimulation (FES) for the left wrist and finger extensors, if appropriate for the brachial plexus injury.
    *   Task-specific bilateral training to reintegrate the left arm as a functional assist.
    *   Consideration of custom splinting for the left elbow to maintain ROM gains.

**Speech and Language Therapy (SLT):**

*   **Swallowing Evaluation:** Immediate scheduling of a formal swallowing assessment (e.g., FEES/VFSS) to determine the safety of oral diet, recommend appropriate food/liquid consistencies, and guide nasogastric tube weaning.
*   **Tracheostomy Management:** Collaboration with the physician and respiratory therapist to implement a weaning protocol, including Passy-Muir Valve (PMV) trials to restore phonation and improve airway protection.
*   **Cognitive-Communication Therapy:** Address pragmatic and social communication skills, as well as higher-level language processing, to facilitate effective interaction.

**Prosthetics and Orthotics (P&O):**

*   **Initial Consultation:** Immediate consultation for stump assessment, patient education, and planning for the prosthetic process.
*   **Preparatory Prosthesis:** Plan for the fabrication and fitting of a preparatory (temporary) prosthesis as soon as stump volume stabilizes to allow for early ambulation training.

**Rehabilitation Nursing:**

*   **24-Hour Care Integration:** Ensure carryover of therapeutic strategies throughout the day.
*   **Stump & Skin Care:** Daily inspection of the stump and pressure-prone areas to prevent breakdown.
*   **Bowel & Bladder Program:** Implement a timed voiding and bowel program to promote continence.
*   **Patient & Family Education:** Provide ongoing education on the patient's condition, care needs, and home exercise program to prepare for discharge.

**Psychological Support:**

*   **Neuropsychological Consultation:** Formal assessment to fully characterize cognitive strengths and weaknesses and guide cognitive rehabilitation.
*   **Counseling:** Provide individual and family counseling to address adjustment to disability, body image changes post-amputation, anxiety, and potential depression. Teach coping strategies to manage frustration and enhance motivation.
