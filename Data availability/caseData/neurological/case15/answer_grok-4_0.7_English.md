# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks)
- Improve muscle strength in proximal and distal limbs to MMT 4/5.
- Enhance sitting balance to Level 2 (able to sit independently with minimal support).
- Improve swallowing function to allow safe oral intake of soft foods without aspiration.
- Enhance speech intelligibility to produce simple words or phrases with moderate assistance.
- Increase Barthel Index score to 20–30, indicating partial independence in basic ADLs (e.g., feeding with assistance).
- Reduce lethargy and improve mood through structured activities and psychological support.

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months)
- Achieve functional ambulation (Holden Functional Ambulation Classification Level 3–4) with assistive devices.
- Restore muscle strength to MMT 4+/5 or better in all limbs.
- Achieve independent sitting and standing balance (Level 4).
- Attain safe and independent swallowing for a regular diet.
- Improve speech to functional communication (able to express basic needs with minimal assistance).
- Increase Barthel Index score to 50–60, reflecting moderate independence in ADLs (e.g., dressing, transfers).
- Address sleep and mood disturbances to support overall rehabilitation progress.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy
- **Strength Training:**  
  - Progressive resistance exercises for proximal and distal limbs (e.g., theraband exercises, light weights) 30 min/day, 5 days/week, tailored to MMT 3/5 baseline.  
  - Focus on functional movements (e.g., shoulder flexion, knee extension) to improve ADL performance.  
- **Balance Training:**  
  - Supported sitting exercises (e.g., reaching tasks, weight shifting) to progress toward unsupported sitting, 20 min/day, 5 days/week.  
  - Gradual introduction of standing exercises with parallel bars or walker support as tolerated.  
- **Range of Motion (ROM):**  
  - Daily passive ROM exercises for all joints to maintain mobility, combined with active-assisted exercises to prevent contractures, 15–20 min/day.  
  - Address mild upper limb spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale 1+) with stretching and positioning.  
- **Functional Mobility Training:**  
  - Bed mobility and transfer training (e.g., bed to wheelchair) with maximal assistance, progressing to moderate assistance, 20 min/day, 5 days/week.  
  - Gait training with assistive devices (e.g., walker) once standing balance improves, starting with weight-bearing exercises.

### Occupational Therapy
- **ADL Training:**  
  - Task-specific training for feeding, grooming, and dressing with adaptive equipment (e.g., built-up utensils, button hooks), 30 min/day, 5 days/week.  
  - Environmental modifications (e.g., grab bars, raised toilet seat) to support independence.  
- **Upper Limb Functional Training:**  
  - Fine motor exercises (e.g., pegboard, grasping tasks) to improve distal upper limb function, 20 min/day, 5 days/week.  
  - Constraint-induced movement therapy (if feasible) to encourage use of affected limbs.  

### Speech and Language Therapy
- **Swallowing Therapy:**  
  - Oropharyngeal strengthening exercises (e.g., effortful swallow, Mendelsohn maneuver) under speech therapist supervision, 20 min/day, 5 days/week.  
  - Trial modified textures (e.g., thickened liquids, pureed foods) with videofluoroscopy guidance if available to assess aspiration risk.  
  - Postural techniques (e.g., chin tuck) during swallowing trials to enhance safety.  
- **Speech Therapy:**  
  - Articulation exercises targeting simple phonemes and words, progressing to short phrases, 20 min/day, 5 days/week.  
  - Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies (e.g., picture boards) to support communication during recovery.  
  - Address mixed aphasia with melodic intonation therapy and verbal cueing to improve expressive speech.

### Psychological and Cognitive Support
- **Psychological Intervention:**  
  - Weekly counseling sessions (30 min) with a clinical psychologist to address lethargy, depressed mood, and emotional lability.  
  - Encourage participation in group activities or music therapy to improve mood and engagement, 1–2 sessions/week.  
- **Cognitive Rehabilitation:**  
  - Basic attention and memory exercises (e.g., matching tasks, simple puzzles) tailored to patient’s uncooperative state, 15 min/day, 5 days/week.  
  - Gradual progression to structured cognitive tasks as cooperation improves.

### Additional Interventions
- **Nutritional Support:**  
  - Continue enteral nutrition (e.g., nasogastric tube) until swallowing safety improves, with daily monitoring by a dietitian.  
  - Supplement with high-protein diet to support muscle recovery once oral intake is safe.  
- **Spasticity Management:**  
  - Low-dose baclofen (5–10 mg BID) or tizanidine (2 mg BID) if upper limb spasticity worsens, titrated by neurologist.  
  - Daily monitoring of Modified Ashworth Scale to guide interventions.  
- **Sleep Management:**  
  - Sleep hygiene education (e.g., consistent bedtime, limiting daytime naps) provided by nursing staff.  
  - Consider low-dose melatonin (3 mg at bedtime) if sleep disorder persists, in consultation with neurologist.  
- **Medical Management:**  
  - Continue antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy as prescribed, with regular BP monitoring (target <130/80 mmHg).  
  - Monitor liver function tests biweekly due to abnormal liver function; adjust hepatoprotectants as needed.  
  - Taper steroids (prednisone) per neurologist’s plan to minimize side effects while monitoring neurological status.

### Interdisciplinary Coordination
- Weekly team meetings with physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, psychologist, dietitian, and rehabilitation physician to review progress and adjust plan.  
- Family education sessions (1–2 times/month) to teach transfer techniques, swallowing precautions, and emotional support strategies.  
- Regular reassessment of Barthel Index, MMT, and balance levels every 2 weeks to track functional gains.
