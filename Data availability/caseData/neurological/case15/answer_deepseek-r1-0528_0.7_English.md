# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term Goals (2-4 weeks)
- Achieve independent bed-chair transfers with minimal assistance
- Improve swallowing safety: Eliminate aspiration with thickened liquids
- Establish basic yes/no communication reliability
- Increase proximal limb strength to MMT 4/5
- Achieve static sitting balance for 5 minutes
- Manage urinary incontinence with timed voiding schedule
- Increase Barthel Index to 20 (minimal improvement in feeding/hygiene)

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months)
- Achieve independent ambulation with single-point cane (Holden FAC ≥3)
- Restore functional swallowing for regular diet
- Develop simple phrase-level communication
- Regain modified independence in ADLs (Barthel ≥60)
- Establish cognitive compensatory strategies
- Normalize muscle tone throughout extremities

## 2. Treatment Methods
### Neuromotor Rehabilitation
- **Task-Specific Training:** 
  - Progressive sit-to-stand drills with height-adjusted surfaces
  - Weight-shifting exercises on rocker board
  - Treadmill training with 30% body-weight support
- **Strength Training:** 
  - Progressive resistance exercise (PRE) for proximal muscles
  - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to quadriceps/shoulder girdle
- **Tone Management:** 
  - Sustained stretching protocols for upper limbs
  - Positioning splints during rest periods

### Dysphagia Management
- **Compensatory Strategies:**
  - Chin tuck with double swallow technique
  - Strict NPO for thin liquids, initiate nectar-thick fluids
- **Therapeutic Exercises:**
  - Shaker exercise protocol (3x/day)
  - Lingual resistance training with Iowa Oral Performance Instrument
  - Thermal-tactile stimulation before meals

### Communication Rehabilitation
- **Aphasia Therapy:**
  - Picture Communication System for basic needs
  - Melodic Intonation Therapy for phrase production
  - Constraint-Induced Language Therapy (CILT) principles

### Cognitive-Behavioral Intervention
- **Attention Training:** 
  - Time-on-task increments using simple sorting tasks
  - Alertness program with environmental cueing
- **Mood Management:**
  - Behavioral activation scheduling
  - Relaxation breathing techniques

### Bladder/Bowel Retraining
- Timed voiding every 2 hours (07:00-21:00)
- Pelvic floor muscle awareness training
- Fluid intake scheduling (1500ml/day cutoff at 18:00)

### ADL Training
- Dressing training with adaptive equipment (buttonhook, reacher)
- Self-feeding program with weighted utensils
- Wheelchair mobility skills for indoor navigation

### Adjunct Therapies
- **Cardiopulmonary:** 
  - Threshold inspiratory muscle trainer (30% max pressure)
  - Upright tolerance protocol with tilt-table
- **Precautions:** 
  - Continuous BP monitoring during upright activities
  - SpO₂ monitoring during swallowing trials
  - Fall risk protocol during transfers
