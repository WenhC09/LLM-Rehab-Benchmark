# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2–4 weeks)
- Improve alertness, attention, and participation in rehabilitation activities.
- Enhance sitting balance from Level 0 to Level 1–2 with support.
- Increase proximal limb muscle strength from MMT 3/5 to 4/5 where possible.
- Begin initiation of active-assisted range of motion (AAROM) in distal limbs.
- Reduce risk of aspiration by improving swallowing safety (FDS: advance from water aspiration to safe intake of thickened liquids).
- Establish basic communication using nonverbal or augmentative methods.
- Improve sleep quality and stabilize mood to facilitate engagement in therapy.
- Educate caregivers on safe handling, positioning, and feeding.

### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
- Achieve independent sitting balance and progress to standing balance ≥ Level 2.
- Improve functional ambulation to Holden Level ≥ 2 (assisted walking over short distances).
- Regain sufficient upper limb function to assist in feeding and grooming.
- Restore safe oral intake of most consistencies without aspiration.
- Enhance verbal communication to functional level with reduction of aphasia severity.
- Maximize ADL performance, aiming for Barthel Index ≥ 40 (partial independence in some self-care).
- Achieve stable mood and improved cognitive function to support self-directed activity.
- Prevent secondary complications (contractures, pressure ulcers, aspiration pneumonia).

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 Physical Therapy (PT)
- **Positioning & Prevention:** Maintain joints in functional positions; use cushions to prevent pressure sores; daily skin checks.
- **Passive & Active-Assisted ROM:** 2–3×/day to maintain joint mobility and prevent contractures.
- **Strength Training:**  
  - Proximal muscles: gravity-reduced exercises → resistance as tolerated.  
  - Distal muscles: facilitation techniques and tactile stimulation to encourage activation.
- **Balance Training:**  
  - Early: supported sitting on therapy mat with trunk facilitation.  
  - Progress to dynamic sitting balance and supported standing frame as tolerated.
- **Functional Mobility:** Bed mobility training, transfers with maximal assistance, gradual introduction of sit-to-stand.

### 2.2 Occupational Therapy (OT)
- **ADL Retraining:** Grooming, feeding, dressing with adaptive strategies and devices.
- **Upper Limb Function:** Task-oriented activities, bilateral upper limb training, constraint-induced movement (when feasible).
- **Cognitive Stimulation:** Simple structured tasks to improve attention, memory, and problem-solving.
- **Environmental Modifications:** Adaptations for home safety and ease of caregiving.

### 2.3 Speech and Language Therapy (SLT)
- **Aphasia Therapy:**  
  - Auditory comprehension exercises, naming drills, repetition tasks.  
  - Use of picture boards or communication apps for augmentative/alternative communication.
- **Dysarthria Management:** Oral-motor exercises, breath support training, voice strengthening.
- **Swallowing Therapy:**  
  - Oral motor facilitation, effortful swallow, Mendelsohn maneuver when possible.  
  - Gradual food texture progression under guidance; use of thickened liquids initially.  
  - Compensatory strategies: chin tuck, small sips/bites, upright posture ≥30 min after meals.

### 2.4 Cognitive Rehabilitation
- Structured orientation activities (time, place, person).
- Attention training with gradually increasing complexity.
- Functional problem-solving and sequencing tasks.

### 2.5 Psychological Support
- Supportive counseling to address depression and anxiety.
- Sleep hygiene education; consider relaxation techniques or music therapy.
- Involve family in therapy sessions to promote motivation and emotional support.

### 2.6 Nursing Care
- Bladder/Bowel Training: Scheduled toileting, monitor for urinary retention or constipation.
- Nutrition Support: Monitor intake, weight, and hydration; adjust diet per swallowing assessment.
- Skin Care: Frequent repositioning; pressure relief cushions.

### 2.7 Medical Management
- Continue management of hypertension, liver function monitoring.
- Monitor for spasticity; initiate antispasmodics if tone increases significantly.
- Adjust medications for mood, sleep, and pain as needed.
- Regular reassessment of electrolytes (given history of severe hyponatremia).

### 2.8 Caregiver Education
- Safe transfer methods, positioning, feeding techniques.
- Recognition of aspiration signs and emergency responses.
- Home exercise program to continue therapy outside sessions.

**Therapy Frequency:**  
- PT: 1–2 sessions/day, 5–6 days/week  
- OT: 1 session/day, 5–6 days/week  
- SLT: 1 session/day, 5–6 days/week  
- Nursing & caregiver training: ongoing daily  
- Psychological support: 1–2×/week or as needed

**Reassessment:**  
- Every 2–4 weeks to adjust goals and interventions based on progress.
