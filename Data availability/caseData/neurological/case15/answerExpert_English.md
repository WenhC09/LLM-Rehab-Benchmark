# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals:
*   Improve cognitive function, emotional state, and sleep quality;
*   Enhance muscle strength in all four limbs;
*   Improve sitting and standing balance abilities, as well as ambulation capacity;
*   Strengthen speech function;
*   Increase respiratory muscle strength.

### Long-term Goal:
Achieve basic independence in activities of daily living (ADL), enabling the patient to return to family and community life.

## 2. Therapeutic Interventions:

This patient's rehabilitation plan is a comprehensive, individualized program integrating Physical Therapy (PT), Occupational Therapy (OT), Speech and Swallowing Therapy, Cognitive Training, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) therapies, dynamically adjusted based on the patient's condition. Specific methods include:

*   **Limb Function & Mobility Training (PT/OT/ADL):**
    *   **Basic Mobility Training:** Early bedside training, including guided active training for independent rolling and supine-to-sit transfers.
    *   **Balance & Standing Training:** Implement sitting balance training to enhance core stability; utilize a standing frame for standing training to promote early weight-bearing on lower limbs.
    *   **Strength & Coordination Training:** Utilize lower limb cycle ergometer training to improve bilateral lower limb coordination and muscular endurance.
    *   **Ambulation Training:** Progress gradually from supported standing at bedside to assisted ambulation indoors, with the ultimate goal of achieving independent, slow walking.
    *   **Upper Limb Function Training:** Improve fine motor skills of the upper limbs.

*   **Speech Function Training:**
    *   **Orofacial Muscle Exercises:** Daily exercises including cheek puffing, tongue protrusion, tongue exercise routines, and oral motor exercises, combined with bilateral facial massage to enhance orofacial muscle strength and coordination.
    *   **Articulation & Communication Training:** Implement a targeted daily speech therapy plan; instruct family members to engage in frequent communication and correct articulation errors during daily conversation.
    *   **Environmental Stimulation:** Regularly play news and music to provide a rich language environment promoting speech function recovery.

*   **Swallowing Function Training:**
    *   **Swallow Reflex Stimulation:** Apply cold stimulation using a chilled (approx. 4°C) long-handled metal spoon placed at the faucial pillars to elicit and enhance the swallow reflex.
    *   **Oropharyngeal Muscle Function Training:** Guide daily exercises: jaw opening/closing, phonating /a/ and /k/ sounds; perform exaggerated chewing motions; tactile cueing over the larynx to facilitate swallow awareness and execution.
    *   **Diet Management & Techniques:** Post-meal, instruct the patient to clear residue using lingual or labial movements instead of napkins, to exercise oral function. Progress diet from pureed foods (e.g., dragon fruit) to regular texture as swallowing improves, with continuous supervision to prevent aspiration/choking.

*   **Cognitive Function Training:**
    *   **Consciousness Level Facilitation:** During initial admission with altered consciousness, apply Right Median Nerve Electrical Stimulation (MNES) as peripheral intervention. Stimulus signals ascend centrally to promote brain plasticity and consciousness recovery.
    *   **Emotional Management & Support:** Monitor emotional changes; validate emotional behaviors (e.g., irritability); provide emotional support and guidance for expressing negative feelings; instruct family to offer psychosocial and practical support to enhance rehabilitation motivation.

*   **Respiratory Function Training:**
    *   Activate respiratory muscles and enhance their endurance/coordination via head/neck muscle stretching, thoracic cage mobilization, and specific respiratory muscle exercises. This improves cardiopulmonary function and SpO₂, boosts energy/endurance, and aids in preventing aspiration/choking by improving respiratory-swallow coordination.

*   **Physical Modalities & Adjunctive Therapies:**
    *   **Acupuncture:** Regulate meridians and improve local circulation.
    *   **Intermediate Frequency Current (IFC) Therapy:** Stimulate target muscle groups to elicit active contraction, prevent muscle atrophy, and promote neurological recovery.
