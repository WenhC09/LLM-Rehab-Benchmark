# Medical Record Summary

## I. Basic Information
- **Sex:** Female  
- **Age:** 50 years  

## II. Medical History  

### Chief Complaint  
Limb mobility impairment with slurred speech for over 2 months.  

### Present Illness  
On December 27, 2022, the patient experienced decreased appetite and vomiting without obvious cause, followed by confusion and incoherent speech (e.g., mistaking hands for a mobile phone), and unsteady gait. Admitted to a local hospital, lab tests revealed severe hyponatremia (serum sodium: 97.7 mmol/L). After sodium supplementation, consciousness cleared the next day, and ambulation resumed. On December 31, 2022, she developed acute limb weakness, anarthria, and inability to walk without apparent trigger.  

Cranial MRI (January 2, 2023): Abnormal signal intensity in bilateral central sulci; ischemic lesions or artifacts not excluded. Multiple bilateral cerebral ischemic/degenerative foci. Suspected "encephalitis" led to methylprednisolone 80 mg/day initiation.  

After transfer, repeat cranial MRI (January 6, 2023): Symmetric abnormal signals in bilateral basal ganglia; multiple small cerebral ischemic foci. EEG: Moderately abnormal. EMG: No characteristic changes. Diagnosed with "Osmotic Demyelination of the Central Nervous System." Treated with steroids (methylprednisolone 500 mg/day ×5d, 250 mg/day ×3d; tapered to prednisone 60 mg qd), neurotrophic agents, antihypertensives, and lipid-lowering therapy. Limb mobility partially improved (proximal/distal limbs: MMT 3/5), but distal upper limb movement remained absent. Persistent dysphagia, urinary/fecal incontinence, and anarthria noted.  

On January 21, 2023, limb impairment and anarthria worsened after emotional agitation. Admitted to our Neurology Department. Cranial MRI (January 30, 2023): Multiple abnormal signals in brainstem, bilateral basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex. Combined history supported "Osmotic Demyelination." Managed with fluid resuscitation, steroids, human immunoglobulin, antibiotics, antihypertensives, antiepileptics, hepatoprotectants, acid suppression, nutritional support, and symptomatic care.  

Transferred to Rehabilitation on February 10, 2023, after stabilization. Unable to stand/walk independently. Dependent on others for feeding, dressing, transfers, toileting, and bathing. Since onset: lethargy, depressed mood, normal appetite, poor sleep, occasional incontinence, no significant weight loss.  

### Past History  
Hypertension (several years), status post left lower leg fracture surgery (2 years prior).  

### Family History  
Denies family history of genetic or similar disorders.  

## III. Admission (Pre-Rehabilitation) Examination & Assessment  

### Physical Examination  
- Temp: 36.7°C, Pulse: 92 bpm, RR: 19/min, BP: 99/60 mmHg  
- Conscious, moderate nutrition, wheelchair-bound  
- Lungs: Clear breath sounds; no rales  
- Cardiac/Abdominal: Unremarkable  

### Specialized Examination & Functional Assessment  
*   **Mental Status:** Conscious, lethargic, uncooperative with exam.  
*   **Speech Function:** Incomplete mixed aphasia.  
*   **Cognition:** Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) not assessable.  
*   **Swallowing Function:** Water aspiration noted.  
*   **Cranial Nerves:**  
    - Extraocular movements intact; no nystagmus/diplopia.  
    - Pupils isocoric (≈3mm), direct/consensual light reflexes intact.  
    - Facial sensation symmetric.  
    - Symmetric forehead wrinkles/nasolabial folds; uncooperative with grimace/tongue protrusion/gag reflex.  
*   **Muscle Strength (MMT):**  
    - Upper limbs: Proximal 3/5, Distal 3/5  
    - Lower limbs: Proximal 3/5, Distal 3/5  
*   **Muscle Tone:**  
    - Upper limbs: Mild increase (Modified Ashworth Scale 1+)  
    - Lower limbs: Normal  
*   **Range of Motion (ROM):** Passive ROM essentially normal in all joints.  
*   **Sensory System:** Deep/superficial sensation unassessable bilaterally.  
*   **Reflexes:**  
    - Biceps/Triceps/Brachioradialis: 2+ bilaterally  
    - Patellar/Achilles: 2+ bilaterally  
    - Ankle clonus (-), Hoffmann (-), Babinski (-) bilaterally  
*   **Coordination:** Finger-nose & heel-shin tests unperformable bilaterally.  
*   **Balance & Ambulation:**  
    - Sitting balance: Level 0  
    - Standing balance: Level 0  
    - Holden Functional Ambulation Classification: Level 0  
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):**  
    - Barthel Index: 0 (Total dependence)  

### Diagnostic Investigations  
*   **Cranial MRI (Jan 2, 2023):** Abnormal signal intensity in bilateral central sulci; ischemic lesions or artifacts not excluded. Multiple bilateral cerebral ischemic/degenerative foci.  
*   **Cranial MRI (Jan 6, 2023):** Symmetric abnormal signals in bilateral basal ganglia; multiple small cerebral ischemic foci.  
*   **EEG:** Moderately abnormal.  
*   **Cranial MRI (Jan 30, 2023):** Multiple abnormal signals in brainstem, bilateral basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex.
