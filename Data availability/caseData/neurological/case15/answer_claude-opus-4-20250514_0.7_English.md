# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Improve sitting balance to Grade 1 within 4 weeks.
- Achieve proximal muscle strength of 4/5 in upper and lower limbs within 6 weeks.
- Enhance communication skills to facilitate basic needs expression within 6 weeks.
- Establish a safe swallowing strategy to reduce aspiration risk within 4 weeks.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve independent transfers and basic ADLs (feeding, dressing, toileting) within 3 months.
- Improve ambulation to at least Grade 2 on the Holden Functional Ambulation Classification within 3 months.
- Enhance cognitive function to a level where the patient can participate in rehabilitation activities and follow simple commands within 3 months.
- Develop a structured sleep hygiene program to improve sleep quality within 3 months.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### Physical Rehabilitation:
- **Strength Training:** Focus on proximal muscle strengthening exercises for both upper and lower limbs using resistance bands and body weight, progressing as tolerated.
- **Balance Training:** Initiate with seated balance exercises, gradually progressing to standing balance activities with support.
- **Mobility Training:** Begin with assisted transfers and progress to standing and ambulation with a walker or parallel bars as strength improves.

### Speech and Language Therapy:
- **Speech Therapy:** Implement exercises to improve articulation and language comprehension, focusing on simple commands and responses.
- **Swallowing Therapy:** Conduct swallowing assessments and implement safe swallowing techniques, including postural adjustments and texture modifications.

### Cognitive Rehabilitation:
- **Cognitive Exercises:** Engage in activities that promote attention, memory, and problem-solving skills, using simple tasks and games tailored to the patient's cognitive level.
- **Mental Health Support:** Provide psychological support and counseling to address depressive symptoms and enhance motivation for rehabilitation.

### Occupational Therapy:
- **ADL Training:** Focus on adaptive techniques for daily living activities, using assistive devices as needed to promote independence.
- **Environmental Modifications:** Assess and modify the home environment to ensure safety and accessibility for the patient.

### Multidisciplinary Approach:
- **Regular Team Meetings:** Coordinate care with neurologists, physiatrists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, and nursing staff to ensure a comprehensive approach to rehabilitation.
- **Family Involvement:** Educate and involve family members in the rehabilitation process to support the patientâ€™s progress and facilitate home care.

### Monitoring and Evaluation:
- **Regular Assessments:** Conduct weekly evaluations of progress towards rehabilitation goals, adjusting the treatment plan as necessary based on the patient's response and needs.
- **Nutritional Support:** Collaborate with a dietitian to ensure adequate nutritional intake, especially considering dysphagia and potential weight loss.
