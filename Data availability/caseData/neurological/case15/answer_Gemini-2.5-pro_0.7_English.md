# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4 weeks):
1.  **Prevent Complications:** Prevent pressure sores, joint contractures, aspiration pneumonia, and deep vein thrombosis.
2.  **Improve Arousal and Engagement:** Increase alertness and achieve consistent, simple cooperation with therapeutic activities for at least 15-20 minutes per session.
3.  **Establish Safe Nutrition:** Determine the safest diet consistency and implement a feeding plan to ensure adequate caloric and fluid intake without aspiration.
4.  **Improve Core Stability and Bed Mobility:** Achieve independent rolling in bed and maintain a static sitting position at the edge of the bed with moderate assistance for 1-2 minutes.
5.  **Establish Basic Communication:** Establish a reliable yes/no communication system (e.g., eye blink, head nod).
6.  **Manage Mood:** Initiate strategies to alleviate depressive symptoms and improve motivation for rehabilitation.

### Long-term goals (within 3-6 months):
1.  **Improve Motor Function:** Achieve independent sitting balance. Progress to performing sit-to-stand transfers with minimal assistance.
2.  **Enhance Mobility:** Achieve independent wheelchair propulsion on level surfaces. Aim for short-distance ambulation with a walker and moderate assistance.
3.  **Increase ADL Independence:** Achieve independence in feeding and grooming with setup assistance. Participate actively in upper and lower body dressing with moderate assistance. (Target Barthel Index: 25-40).
4.  **Improve Swallowing Function:** Tolerate a modified diet (e.g., minced & moist, thickened liquids) orally without signs of aspiration.
5.  **Improve Communication:** Use simple phrases or an augmentative communication device to express basic needs and ideas. Follow 2-step commands consistently.
6.  **Enhance Cognitive Function:** Improve sustained attention and orientation to person, place, and time.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy (PT)
*   **Positioning and Prevention:**
    *   Implement a strict 2-hour turning schedule in bed.
    *   Utilize pressure-relieving mattress and cushions for wheelchair.
    *   Proper limb positioning with pillows/splints to prevent contractures and manage mild upper limb tone.
*   **Range of Motion (ROM) and Stretching:**
    *   Passive ROM exercises for all four limbs, twice daily.
    *   Gentle, prolonged stretching for wrist and finger flexors to address Ashworth Grade 1 spasticity.
*   **Neuromuscular Re-education and Strengthening:**
    *   Active-assisted to active exercises for all major muscle groups (MMT Grade 3), focusing on antigravity movements.
    *   Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) techniques to facilitate movement patterns.
    *   Core stability exercises in supine and sitting positions (e.g., pelvic bridging, trunk stabilization against gentle perturbation).
*   **Bed Mobility and Transfer Training:**
    *   Systematic training for rolling, scooting, and moving from supine to sitting, initially with maximal assistance.
    *   Use of a mechanical lift for all transfers initially to ensure safety. Progress to sit-to-stand training using a tilt table or standing frame to promote weight-bearing and cardiovascular conditioning.
*   **Balance Training:**
    *   Initiate static sitting balance training on a mat table with maximal trunk support. Gradually reduce support as control improves.

### Occupational Therapy (OT)
*   **Upper Extremity Management:**
    *   Task-oriented training focusing on reaching and grasping objects of interest to the patient.
    *   Weight-bearing activities through the upper extremities in a supported sitting position to improve shoulder stability.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training:**
    *   Begin with basic self-care tasks such as facial grooming and self-feeding (once cleared by SLP) using adaptive equipment and hand-over-hand guidance.
    *   Break down tasks into single, manageable steps to accommodate cognitive and motor deficits.
*   **Cognitive and Perceptual Rehabilitation:**
    *   Implement structured sensory stimulation (visual, auditory, tactile) to improve arousal and environmental awareness.
    *   Simple, repetitive orientation activities (using clocks, calendars, family photos).
    *   Single-step command following exercises.
*   **Psychosocial Support:**
    *   Incorporate success-oriented, meaningful activities to improve mood and motivation.
    *   Provide positive reinforcement for all efforts and participation.
    *   Family education on how to interact and support the patient effectively.

### Speech-Language Pathology (SLP)
*   **Dysphagia Management:**
    *   **Immediate instrumental assessment:** Schedule a Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) or Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) to objectively assess swallow physiology and aspiration risk.
    *   **Diet Modification:** Based on assessment, recommend appropriate food texture and liquid consistency. If aspiration is significant with all consistencies, recommend NPO (nothing by mouth) and consult with the medical team regarding a temporary nasogastric or long-term percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for nutrition.
    *   **Swallowing Therapy:** If patient cooperation allows, initiate swallowing exercises (e.g., lingual resistance, effortful swallow) and compensatory strategies (e.g., chin tuck).
    *   Provide oral hygiene care to reduce the bacterial load and risk of aspiration pneumonia.
*   **Aphasia and Communication Therapy:**
    *   Establish a consistent and reliable non-verbal communication system (e.g., communication board with pictures/words, thumbs up/down, eye pointing).
    *   Work on improving auditory comprehension, starting with simple yes/no questions and one-step commands.
    *   Stimulate verbal expression through automatic speech tasks (e.g., counting, days of the week) and sentence completion tasks.

### Rehabilitation Nursing
*   **Bladder and Bowel Program:**
    *   Implement a timed voiding schedule every 2-3 hours to manage urinary incontinence.
    *   Monitor for signs of urinary tract infection.
    *   Establish a regular bowel program with scheduled toileting, adequate fiber (per dietary plan), and hydration to prevent constipation.
*   **Skin Integrity:**
    *   Perform daily skin inspections, especially over bony prominences.
    *   Ensure adherence to the turning and positioning schedule.
*   **Nutritional Support:**
    *   Supervise all meals to ensure adherence to SLP-recommended strategies and diet consistency.
    *   Monitor and document food and fluid intake.
*   **Patient and Family Education:**
    *   Educate the family on the patient's functional status, safety precautions, and the rationale behind the interventions.
    *   Train family members in basic care techniques such as positioning, assisting with ROM, and communication strategies.

### Psychological Intervention
*   **Mood and Adjustment:**
    *   Initiate supportive counseling to address depressed mood, frustration, and adjustment to disability.
    *   Consult with Psychiatry for consideration of antidepressant medication to manage depression and improve lethargy, which are significant barriers to participation.
    *   Address sleep disorder through sleep hygiene education and potential pharmacological intervention.
