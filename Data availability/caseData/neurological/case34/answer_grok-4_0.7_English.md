# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-Term Goals (1–4 Weeks)
- Improve swallowing safety to reduce aspiration risk (target: Rosenbek Penetration-Aspiration Scale ≤4).
- Enhance oropharyngeal muscle strength and coordination (target: improve MASA score to ≥100).
- Achieve safe oral intake of modified textures (target: FOIS Level 3–4).
- Reduce anxiety symptoms (target: SAS score <50).
- Optimize nutritional status (target: NRS2002 score <3).
- Improve phonation and articulation clarity (target: reduced dysarthria severity).

### Long-Term Goals (4–12 Weeks)- Achieve safe and independent oral feeding (target: FOIS Level 5–6).
- Restore functional swallowing with minimal aspiration risk (target: Rosenbek Penetration-Aspiration Scale ≤2).
- Improve speech intelligibility to near-normal levels.
- Maintain stable nutritional status without reliance on nasogastric tube feeding.
- Enhance emotional well-being and sleep quality.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Swallowing Rehabilitation
- **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**:  
  - Apply NMES to suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles to enhance hyolaryngeal excursion and pharyngeal contraction.  
  - Frequency: 5 sessions/week, 30 minutes/session, for 4 weeks.  
  - Parameters: Pulse width 200 µs, frequency 80 Hz, intensity adjusted to patient tolerance.  
- **Mendelsohn Maneuver**:  
  - Train sustained laryngeal elevation during swallowing to improve UES opening and cricopharyngeal relaxation.  
  - 10 repetitions/set, 3 sets/session, 5 sessions/week.  
- **Effortful Swallowing**:  
  - Strengthen pharyngeal muscles to improve bolus propulsion and reduce residue.  
  - 10 repetitions/set, 3 sets/session, 5 sessions/week.  
- **Shaker Exercise**:  
  - Enhance suprahyoid muscle strength to improve UES opening.  
  - 3 sets of 60-second isometric holds and 30 repetitions of dynamic head lifts, 5 sessions/week.  
- **Swallowing Trials with Modified Textures**:  
  - Initiate with thickened liquids (IDDSI Level 2–3) under supervision to minimize aspiration risk.  
  - Progress to pureed foods (IDDSI Level 4) as tolerated, guided by VFSS feedback.  
  - Frequency: Daily, supervised by speech-language pathologist (SLP).  
- **Thermal-Tactile Stimulation**:  
  - Stimulate pharyngeal sensory input to improve swallowing initiation.  
  - Apply cold touch to anterior faucial pillars, 10 repetitions/side, 3 sessions/day.  

### Speech and Phonation Therapy
- **Vocal Exercises**:  
  - Perform pitch glides and sustained phonation to improve vocal fold closure and reduce hoarseness.  
  - 10 repetitions/set, 3 sets/session, 5 sessions/week, guided by SLP  
- **Articulation Training**:  
  - Practice consonant-vowel combinations to enhance dysarthria clarity.  
  - Focus on bilial and lingual movements, 15 minutes/session, 5 sessions/week.  
- **Oral Motor Exercises**:  
  - Strengthen lips, tongue, and soft palate with resistance exercises (e.g., tongue depressor push, lip pursing).  
  - 10 repetitions/exercise, 3 sets/session, daily.  

### Nutritional Management
- **Dietary Plan**:  
  - nasogastric tube feeding to meet caloric needs (estimated 1800–2000 kcal/day, adjusted by dietitian).  
  - Gradually transition to oral intake based on FOIS progression, starting with thickened liquids and pureed foods.  
  - Monitor for weight stability and adjust intake accordingly.  
- **Nutritional Monitoring**:  
  - Weekly NRS2002 assessments to track malnutrition risk.  
  - Supplement with high-protein, high-calorie oral nutritional supplements if oral intake is insufficient.  

### Psychological Support
 **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**:  
  - Address anxiety and depressed mood with weekly 30-minute sessions led by a psychologist.  
  - Focus on coping strategies for postoperative recovery and dysphagia-related stress.  
- **Relaxation Techniques**:  
  - Train in progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing exercises to improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety.  
  - 10–15 minutes/day, guided by therapist or self-administered.  

### Physical and Functional Support
- **Positioning Training**:  
  - Educate on upright posture (90°) during swallowing attempts to minimize aspiration risk.  
  - Use chin-tuck or head-turn techniques as guided by SLP during swallowing trials.  
- **Aerobic and Mobility**:  
  - Light walking (10–15 minutes/day, as tolerated) to maintain general physical condition and support mood.  
  - Monitor BP and pulse to ensure cardiovascular stability.  

### Monitoring and Follow-Up
- **Weekly Assessments**:  
  - Conduct MASA, FOIS, and Rosenbek Penetration-Aspiration Scale to monitor swallowing progress.  
  - Reassess SAS score biweekly to track anxiety.  
- **VFSS Re-Evaluation**:  
  - Repeat VFSS at 4 weeks to assess improvements in swallowing mechanics and guide dietary progression.  
- **Multidisciplinary Team Coordination**:  
  - Weekly meetings with SLP, dietitian, psychologist, and neurosurgery team to adjust plan based on patient response.  
- **Patient and Caregiver Education**:  
  - Train caregivers on safe feeding techniques, aspiration precautions, and home exercise programs.  
  - Provide written instructions and demonstrations for swallowing and speech exercises.  

This plan will be adjusted dynamically based on the patient’s progress, with close monitoring to ensure safety and efficacy.
