# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (2-week timeframe)
- Achieve FOIS Level 3 (oral intake of single consistencies with tube supplement)
- Reduce Rosenbek Scale to ≤ Level 4 (penetration without aspiration)
- Improve RSST to ≥3 swallows/30 seconds
- Establish safe oral intake of thickened liquids (IDDSI Level 2-3)
- Initiate compensatory swallowing strategies training
- Address nutritional risk via modified enteral feeding protocol
- Reduce SAS score to <50 (below clinical anxiety threshold)

### Long-term Goals (6-8 week timeframe)
- Achieve FOIS Level 6 (full oral diet with special preparation)
- Eliminate aspiration on thin liquids (Rosenbek Level 1-2)
- Restore independent oral nutrition with IDDSI Level 7 regular diet
- Normalize hyolaryngeal excursion (>2 finger-width elevation)
- Establish protective cough reflex
- Discontinue NG tube dependence

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Dysphagia Therapy
1. **Sensory-Motor Retraining**  
   - Thermal-tactile stimulation (iced laryngeal mirror) to improve swallow initiation  
   - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (VitalStim®) at submental region (25-35mA, 80Hz)  
   - Bolus manipulation training with 1-3ml paste consistencies (IDDSI Level 4)  

2. **Physiologic Exercise Protocol**  
   - Shaker exercises (3x/day, 1-min holds/30-sec rest) for UES opening  
   - Masako maneuver with tongue protrusion during dry swallows  
   - Effortful swallow technique with laryngeal adduction  

3. **Compensatory Strategies**  
   - Chin tuck posture during swallowing trials  
   - Supraglottic swallow technique with breath-hold  
   - Alternating liquid/solid boluses to clear residue  

4. **Instrumental Biofeedback**  
   - Surface EMG-guided swallowing coordination training  
   - Weekly VFSS re-evaluations to adjust therapy parameters  

### Medical Management
- **Nutrition**: Modified NG formula (1.5kcal/ml high-protein) with scheduled 30° HOB elevation  
- **Aspiration Prevention**: Strict NPO for thin liquids, rigorous oral care Q4H  
- **GI Motility**: Consider prokinetic agents if UES dysfunction persists  

### Adjunctive Therapies
- **Psychological Support**: Daily relaxation breathing + cognitive restructuring for anxiety  
- **Vocal Cord Activation**: Laryngeal adduction exercises (5x10 reps/day)  
- **Environmental Modifications**: Silent dining area with 45° upright positioning  

### Monitoring Parameters
- Daily: SpO₂ monitoring during trials, secretion volume tracking  
- Biweekly: Repeat MASA, RSST, and 3ml water test (with pulse oximetry)  
- Weekly: Team conference (ENT, SLP, Nutrition) for aspiration risk reassessment  

### Precautions
- Continuous pulse oximetry during initial oral trials  
- Bedside suction available at all sessions  
- Defer ice chip trials until cough reflex improves
