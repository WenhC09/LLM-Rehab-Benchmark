# Medical Record Information

## I. Case Summary

### Basic Information
Male patient, 81 years old.

### Chief Complaint
Postoperative facial spasm with dysphagia and choking for 1 day.

### Present Illness
The patient experienced involuntary left eyelid twitching over the past decade, progressively spreading to the left face and oral commissure. Previous treatments including medications, botulinum toxin injections, and acupuncture provided suboptimal relief. Admitted to our neurosurgery department on July 22, 2023. Facial nerve MRI revealed close contact between the left trigeminal nerve prepontine segment and adjacent vessels; cranial MRI showed no abnormalities. On July 24, 2023, underwent "Microvascular Decompression (MVD) via Retrosigmoid Suboccipital Approach" under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, tortuous and hypertrophic Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA) compressed the facial nerve root, with left vertebral artery located posterosuperior to PICA. After neurovascular dissection and layered decompression, Teflon pledgets were placed between vessels and brainstem. On postoperative day 1, the patient developed dysphagia manifested as swallowing difficulty and choking, requiring nasogastric tube feeding. Cranial MRI showed no significant abnormalities. Rehabilitation consultation was requested. The patient is alert with depressed mood, dependent on NG tube feeding, experiencing poor sleep, with normal bowel/bladder function and stable weight.

### Past Medical History
Hypertension (max BP 170/100 mmHg), controlled within normal range with Beijing Antihypertensive No.0. Denies history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, or other chronic conditions.

### Family History & Personal History
Non-contributory.

### Physical Examination
- **Vital Signs**: Temp 36.3°C, Pulse 90 bpm, Resp 20/min, BP 136/78 mmHg.  
- **General Status**: Alert, oriented, cooperative. Slightly slurred speech with mild hoarseness. Moderate nutrition.  
- **Systemic Examination**: Clear lung sounds without rales. No significant cardiac or abdominal abnormalities.  

**Diagnoses:**  
* Severe Neurogenic Dysphagia  
* Aspiration  
* Phonation Disorder  
* Dysarthria  
* Left Facial Nerve Palsy (Postoperative)  
* Mild Anxiety State  
* Malnutrition Risk  
* Left Hemifacial Spasm (Postoperative Status)  
* Hypertension  
* Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (Fazekas Grade I)  

## II. Pre-Rehabilitation Quantitative Assessments

### Specialized Examination
- **Mental Status**: Alert, oriented. No significant facial spasms.  
- **Orofacial and Laryngeal Function**:  
    - **Oral Cavity**: Reduced sensation, right deviation, drooling, mildly impaired elevation.  
    - **Lips**: Mildly impaired elevation and retraction.  
    - **Tongue**: Mildly impaired elevation.  
    - **Larynx**: Elevation of 1 fingerbreadth.  
    - **Soft Palate**: Mildly impaired elevation.  
    - **Pharyngeal Reflex**: Absent.  
    - **Cough Reflex**: Absent.  
- **Swallowing Function Screening & Assessment**:  
    - **Repetitive Saliva Swallowing Test (RSST)**: 1 swallow/30 sec.  
    - **Water Swallowing Test**: Immediate choking with 1mL.  
    - **Kubota Water Swallowing Test**: Unable to complete.  
    - **Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10)**: 34 points.  
    - **Modified Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (MASA)**: 76 points.  
    - **Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS)**: Level 1.  
    - **Rosenbek Penetration-Aspiration Scale**: Level 6.  
- **Psychological & Nutritional Assessment**:  
    - **Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS)**: 56 points (Mild anxiety).  
    - **Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS2002)**: 3 points (Nutritional risk).  

### Auxiliary Examinations
1.  **Cranial MRI**: T₂/FLAIR hyperintensities in deep white matter (Fazekas Grade I). No other abnormalities.  
2.  **Facial Nerve MRI**: Close neurovascular contact at left trigeminal nerve prepontine cistern.  
3.  **Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS)**:  
    - Insufficient tongue propulsion/control  
    - Adequate soft palate elevation, no reflux  
    - Delayed swallowing initiation  
    - Reduced hyolaryngeal excursion  
    - Impaired epiglottic inversion  
    - Delayed laryngeal closure  
    - Reduced pharyngeal peristalsis/contraction  
    - Cricopharyngeal achalasia  
    - Upper Esophageal Sphincter (UES) failure to open; bolus transit obstructed.
