# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

### Patient: 81-year-old male
### Diagnosis: Severe Oropharyngeal Dysphagia post-Microvascular Decompression Surgery

---

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2-4 weeks):
1.  **Prevent Complications:** Maintain strict Nil Per Os (NPO) status to prevent aspiration pneumonia. Ensure adequate nutrition and hydration via nasogastric (NG) tube feeding.
2.  **Improve Oral and Pharyngeal Motor Function:** Enhance strength, range of motion, and coordination of labial, lingual, and laryngeal musculature through targeted exercises.
3.  **Enhance Airway Protection:** Re-establish or improve protective mechanisms, including voluntary cough and glottic closure.
4.  **Manage Psychological Distress:** Reduce patient anxiety and address depressive mood through education, support, and setting realistic expectations.
5.  **Maintain Oral Hygiene:** Implement a rigorous oral care protocol to minimize bacterial load.

### Long-term goals:
1.  **Achieve Safe Oral Intake:** Transition from NG tube feeding to safe oral intake of, at minimum, a modified texture diet (e.g., puree consistency, FOIS Level 4-5), with the ultimate aim of progressing to the least restrictive diet possible.
2.  **Restore Nutritional Independence:** Achieve full discontinuation of non-oral feeding while maintaining adequate nutritional status.
3.  **Improve Communication:** Enhance speech clarity and voice quality.
4.  **Improve Quality of Life:** Restore confidence in swallowing, reduce mealtime anxiety, and facilitate return to social dining.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Dysphagia Therapy (5-6 sessions/week)
*   **Status:** Strict NPO. All exercises are to be performed non-orally (i.e., "dry swallows" or with saliva only).
*   **Direct Rehabilitative Exercises:**
    1.  **Oral Motor Control:**
        *   Lip exercises: Puckering, smiling, closure against resistance.
        *   Lingual exercises: Protrusion, retraction, lateralization, and elevation against a tongue depressor to improve bolus control.
    2.  **Laryngeal Function & Airway Protection:**
        *   **Mendelsohn Maneuver:** To improve and prolong maximal hyolaryngeal excursion, aiding in UES opening.
        *   **Supraglottic & Super-Supraglottic Swallow:** To practice voluntary airway closure at the level of the true and false vocal folds before and during the swallow.
        *   **Effortful Swallow:** To increase tongue base retraction and pharyngeal pressure.
        *   **Vocal Fold Adduction Exercises:** Pushing/pulling exercises and effortful phonation on the vowel /i/ to improve glottic closure.
    3.  **Pharyngeal & UES Function:**
        *   **Shaker Exercise (Head-Lifts):** To strengthen suprahyoid musculature, which facilitates hyolaryngeal elevation and UES opening. *To be performed with caution given patient's age; monitor for neck strain. Consider Chin Tuck Against Resistance (CTAR) as an alternative.*
        *   **Masako Maneuver (Tongue-Hold):** To increase contraction of the posterior pharyngeal wall.
*   **Sensory Stimulation:**
    *   **Thermal-Tactile Stimulation (TTS):** Apply a chilled laryngeal mirror to the anterior faucial pillars prior to swallowing exercises to heighten sensory awareness and potentially reduce swallow initiation delay.

### B. Speech & Voice Therapy
*   **Articulatory Drills:** Practice exaggerated production of phonemes, syllables, and words to improve speech clarity.
*   **Vocal Function Exercises (VFE):** Implement a structured program of vocal exercises to improve laryngeal muscle strength and coordination, which will benefit both voice quality and airway protection.

### C. Modalities
*   **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES):** Application of surface electrodes to the submental (suprahyoid) region, synchronized with performance of the Mendelsohn maneuver and effortful swallows, to augment muscle contraction and hyoid movement.

### D. Nutritional Management
*   **Maintain NG Tube Feeding:** Continue as the sole source of nutrition and hydration.
*   **Dietitian Consultation:** Collaborate with a dietitian to ensure the enteral feeding formula and rate meet the patient's caloric, protein, and hydration needs for recovery.
*   **Monitoring:** Track body weight, hydration status, and any signs of feeding intolerance.

### E. Psychological Support
*   **Patient & Family Education:** Provide clear explanations about the current swallowing impairment, the rationale for NPO, the treatment plan, and a realistic prognosis.
*   **Anxiety Management:** Address patient's SAS score of 56. Teach simple relaxation and breathing techniques. Provide consistent reassurance and positive reinforcement for effort and small gains.

### F. Monitoring & Re-assessment Plan
*   **Daily:** Bedside assessment of oral motor function, saliva management, and strength of voluntary cough.
*   **Weekly:** Formal re-assessment of MASA score to track progress.
*   **2-4 Weeks:** A repeat Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) is indicated upon clinical evidence of improvement (e.g., improved hyolaryngeal elevation on palpation, stronger voluntary cough) to re-evaluate swallowing physiology and determine if trials of oral intake with specific consistencies and compensatory postures (e.g., chin tuck, head turn) are safe to initiate.
