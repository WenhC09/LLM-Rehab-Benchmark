# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (within 2–4 weeks)
- Improve safety of swallowing to reduce aspiration risk, aiming for gradual initiation of minimal oral trials under supervision.
- Enhance oral motor strength and coordination for lips, tongue, soft palate, and laryngeal structures.
- Initiate compensatory swallowing strategies suitable for current severe dysphagia.
- Maintain adequate nutrition and hydration via NG tube while preventing further weight loss.
- Reduce anxiety through psychological support and patient education.
- Prevent secondary complications such as aspiration pneumonia, contractures, or deconditioning.

### Long-term Goals (within 3–6 months)
- Achieve safe and efficient oral intake sufficient for nutritional needs, aiming for FOIS ≥ Level 5.
- Restore functional swallowing with minimized aspiration risk (Rosenbek Scale ≤ Level 2).
- Improve speech intelligibility and voice quality toward preoperative baseline.
- Optimize facial nerve function for symmetry and oral competence.
- Achieve independence in feeding and related self-care.
- Maintain stable blood pressure and overall health to support ongoing recovery.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Swallowing Function Rehabilitation
1. **Direct Therapy** (when safe per VFSS re-evaluation)
   - Begin with saliva swallows → progress to controlled small-volume puree trials.
   - Use ice chip trials to stimulate swallow reflex if safe.
2. **Indirect Therapy** (initial phase focus)
   - **Oral Motor Exercises**:  
     - Lip closure and retraction exercises.  
     - Tongue elevation, lateralization, and resistance against tongue depressor.  
     - Soft palate elevation drills.
   - **Pharyngeal and Laryngeal Exercises**:  
     - Effortful swallow.  
     - Mendelsohn maneuver for hyolaryngeal elevation.  
     - Masako maneuver to strengthen pharyngeal constrictors.  
     - Shaker exercise or chin tuck against resistance (CTAR) for suprahyoid muscles.
   - Thermal–tactile stimulation to faucial pillars to facilitate swallow onset.
3. **Compensatory Strategies**
   - Postural adjustments: chin-tuck position for thin liquids when trialed.  
   - Bolus modification: thickened liquids, pureed solids when oral trials begin.  
   - Multiple swallows per bolus.
4. **Cricopharyngeal Dysfunction Management**
   - Targeted swallowing maneuvers (Mendelsohn, effortful swallow) to improve UES opening.
   - Consider referral for balloon dilation or botulinum toxin injection to cricopharyngeus if no improvement after intensive therapy (decision with surgical team).

### B. Nutritional Support
- Continue NG feeding with dietitian-developed high-protein, high-calorie formula.
- Monitor weight, serum albumin, and prealbumin weekly.
- Gradual transition to partial oral feeding once swallowing safety confirmed via repeat VFSS.

### C. Speech and Voice Therapy
- Respiratory–phonatory coordination exercises.
- Pitch glides, sustained phonation tasks, and resonance training.
- Articulation drills focusing on bilabial and lingual consonants.

### D. Facial Nerve Rehabilitation
- Gentle facial muscle activation exercises: eyebrow lift, eye closure, smile, lip pursing.
- Mirror feedback to improve symmetry.
- Electrical stimulation only if indicated and safe (avoid excessive intensity to prevent synkinesis).

### E. Psychological Support
- Counseling sessions to address anxiety, promote coping strategies.
- Involve family in education to support emotional well-being.
- Teach relaxation techniques to improve sleep.

### F. Medical and Nursing Interventions
- Strict aspiration precautions: upright positioning during and after feeds, oral hygiene after each feed.
- Blood pressure monitoring and antihypertensive adherence.
- Pulmonary hygiene: incentive spirometry, chest physiotherapy if needed.

### G. Monitoring and Reassessment
- Weekly multidisciplinary review (rehab physician, SLP, dietitian, nursing).
- Repeat VFSS in 2–3 weeks to assess progress.
- Adjust rehabilitation plan according to functional gains and safety.
