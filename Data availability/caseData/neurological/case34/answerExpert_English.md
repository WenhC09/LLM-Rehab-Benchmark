# 1. Rehabilitation Goals

**Short-Term Goals:**
*   Improve orofacial motor and sensory function, reduce drooling, and enhance sequential coordination of swallowing movements.
*   Facilitate pharyngeal reflex initiation through effective intervention to promote swallowing onset, while strengthening airway protection to reduce food leakage and aspiration risk.
*   Enhance speech intelligibility, and improve patient confidence and compliance with rehabilitation therapy through psychological counseling, alleviating anxiety.

**Long-Term Goals:**
*   Focus on improving the amplitude and timeliness of cricopharyngeal muscle opening, ultimately achieving safe oral intake of certain food consistencies.
*   Progressively enhance the safety and efficacy of oral feeding, with the ultimate goal of removing the nasogastric tube and restoring normal oral feeding function.

# 2. Treatment Methods

## **Nutritional Management:**
*   Develop a detailed nutritional plan based on the patient's daily caloric requirement (9211-12979 kJ). For example, daily meals may include 100g egg, 200g lean pork, 100g fish, 300g rice, and 500g vegetables, or calorically equivalent alternatives.
*   Instruct caregivers to puree food using a blender and administer it via nasogastric tube in three divided meals. Adjust feeding methods based on ongoing rehabilitation assessments.
*   When initiating oral intake trials, adhere to the European Society for Swallowing Disorders (ESSD) recommendations: use 5mL per safe bolus and ensure complete swallowing of one bolus before administering the next.
*   For hydration, administer 200-300mL water via nasogastric tube in 4-5 divided doses daily, spaced 3 hours apart, adjusted according to liquid content in meals.

## **Swallowing Behavioral Therapy:**
*   **Oral Sensory Training:** Implement proprioceptive, gustatory, and thermal stimulation techniques intraorally to awaken and enhance oral sensory perception.
*   **Oral Motor Exercises:** Guide the patient through systematic orofacial muscle exercises to strengthen and improve coordination of the lips, tongue, and cheeks.
*   **Shaker Exercise:** Patient lies supine with shoulders flat on the bed, lifts head forcefully to visualize toes and holds the position. Repeat to strengthen suprahyoid muscles and promote laryngeal elevation.
*   **Airway Protection Training:** Employ the supraglottic swallow maneuver: instruct the patient to hold breath before swallowing, and cough voluntarily after swallowing to protect the airway and prevent aspiration.

## **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) Therapy:**
Apply VitalStim neuromuscular electrical stimulation to the suprahyoid muscles. Cleanse the anterior neck skin with medical alcohol or saline before treatment. Place electrodes bilaterally along the anterior midline, between the submental region and the suprahyoid area. Set stimulation intensity to the maximum tolerable dose eliciting definitive muscle contraction.

## **Balloon Dilation (BD) Synchronized with Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) Therapy:**
Initiate post-nasogastric tube removal. Insert a 14-French balloon catheter transnasally to the esophageal inlet. During suprahyoid muscle electrical stimulation, perform incremental water injections into the balloon (volume increasing progressively from 3mL on the 1st session to 9.5mL on the 5th session). At peak electrical sensation, instruct the patient to voluntarily swallow the balloon. The therapist then gently withdraws the balloon. Repeat to intermittently stretch the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), leveraging synergistic effects of electrical stimulation and active swallowing for functional recovery.

## **Rehabilitation Nursing Care:**
*   **Dietary and Oral Care:** Formulate appropriate dietary plans per nutritional guidelines and instruct caregivers on puree preparation. Guide safe oral intake techniques during trials and perform prompt oral hygiene post-meals.
*   **Psychological Support:** Enhance communication, provide psychological counseling to improve disease and rehabilitation process understanding, build confidence, and increase active participation and compliance with therapy.
