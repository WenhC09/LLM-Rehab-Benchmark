# 1. Rehabilitation Goals

*   **Short-term Goals:** Alleviate pain, improve anxiety levels and nutritional status, prevent complications such as venous thromboembolism (VTE), and enhance balance and coordination.
*   **Long-term Goals:** Restore the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) independently and improve social participation.

# 2. Treatment Methods

The patient's rehabilitation plan follows a Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) integrated intervention model. Specific treatments are detailed below:

## **I. Health Education and Complication Prevention**

1.  **Doctor-Patient Communication and Psychological Support:** Provide detailed disease education to the patient and family to enhance understanding. Utilize active listening and encouragement to convey positive emotions, reduce anxiety, build rehabilitation confidence, and improve treatment compliance.
2.  **Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prevention:** Implement education and preventive measures targeting the patient's moderate thrombotic risk.
    *   **Basic Prevention:** Lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation and ensuring daily fluid intake >2500 ml; Implement passive exercises such as calf-to-thigh massage; Instruct the patient in active ankle pump exercises to promote circulation.
    *   **Physical Prevention:** Apply intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices to mechanically enhance venous blood flow in the lower limbs and reduce deep vein thrombosis (DVT) risk.
3.  **Joint Contracture Prevention:** Perform active and passive full-range-of-motion (ROM) exercises for all joints, particularly targeting lower limb mobility limitations, to maintain normal joint function.
4.  **Safety Measures:** Educate the patient and family on fall prevention and bed safety.

## **II. Multidisciplinary Integrated Treatment Plan**

1.  **Nutritional Support Therapy:**
    *   **Dietary Modification:** Provide foods rich in B vitamins (e.g., whole grains, vegetables, animal liver). Ensure meals include eggs, dried fruits, fruits, and staple foods.
    *   **Targeted Nutritional Supplementation:** Administer 400g of specially formulated yogurt daily to improve gut microbiota; Supplement Vitamin D to enhance intestinal mucosal barrier function.
    *   **Pharmacotherapy:**
        *   Mecobalamin Injection 1000μg, once daily, intravenous drip.
        *   Thiamine (Vitamin B₁) 100mg, twice daily, intramuscular injection.
        *   Folic Acid Tablets 5mg, three times daily, oral.
    *   **Lifestyle Intervention:** Abstain from alcohol.

2.  **Pain Management:**
    *   **Pharmacotherapy:** Pregabalin 75mg, twice daily, oral.
    *   **Physical Agent Therapy:** Apply microwave therapy using a saddle-shaped radiator for non-contact irradiation of the plantar surface. Use low-level thermal energy (microthermal dose) for 10 minutes per session, once daily. 10 sessions constitute one course.

3.  **Psychological Intervention:**
    *   **Pharmacotherapy:** To avoid dependence and muscle relaxant side effects associated with benzodiazepines, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) Sertraline Hydrochloride is selected for anxiety management.
    *   **Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS):** Target the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Apply low-frequency (1Hz) stimulation using a figure-8 coil at 90% of motor threshold intensity. Deliver 1500 pulses per session (20 minutes duration), 5 times weekly.

4.  **Rehabilitation Therapy:**
    *   **Enhanced Sensory Training:** Increase sensory input via whole-body vibration, position sense training, and tactile brushing stimulation to promote motor output. Conduct sensory integration training to improve hand-eye-limb coordination.
    *   **Conventional Rehabilitation Training:**
        *   **Core and Lower Limb Strengthening:** Initiate with bridging exercises to train back muscles, enhance pelvic control, trunk strength, and balance.
        *   **Standing and Balance Training:** Perform weight-shifting exercises within parallel bars. Complete forward, backward, left, right leans, and rotations with therapist assistance. Gradually reduce support and progress to simultaneous bilateral lower limb weight-bearing.
        *   **Vestibular Function Training:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding bars while focusing on a target. Progressively narrow the base of support (e.g., reduce foot spacing).
        *   **Coordination Training:** Practice low-load, high-repetition alternating movements (e.g., alternating upper limb raises, forearm pronation/supination) and point-to-point tasks (e.g., finger-to-nose test, finger-to-finger test).
    *   **Anti-Gravity Treadmill Training:** Utilize the treadmill's positive pressure support system to provide progressive weight support reduction (60% to 20%). Employ visual feedback systems to correct abnormal gait patterns. Train for 20 minutes daily, 6 days weekly for 2 consecutive weeks.
    *   **Pro-kin Balance Assessment and Training System:**
        *   **Static Training:** Patient stands on a balance platform, controlling center of gravity to stabilize an on-screen cursor within a target zone.
        *   **Dynamic Training:** Stand on one leg on the balance platform against resistance (Level 5), controlling the cursor to reach targets via large-amplitude ankle movements.
        *   Protocol: 20 minutes per session, once daily, 6 days weekly for 10 consecutive days.
