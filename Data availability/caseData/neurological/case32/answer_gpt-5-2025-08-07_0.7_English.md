# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2–4 weeks)
- Relieve neuropathic pain to VAS ≤4 to improve comfort and participation in training.
- Improve sitting balance from level III to at least level IV; begin supported standing training.
- Increase bilateral lower limb proximal muscle strength by at least 0.5 MMT grade.
- Enhance ADL performance: Modified Barthel Index from 50 to ≥60 through training and adaptive strategies.
- Improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety symptoms (HAMA score reduction by ≥25%).
- Begin nutritional support to promote weight gain and improve albumin levels toward normal range.
- Educate patient and family about disease, rehabilitation process, home safety, and prevention of complications (pressure sores, VTE, falls).

### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
- Achieve independent sitting balance and standing balance to at least level II, with ability to walk short distances with assistive device.
- Further increase lower limb muscle strength to ≥grade 4 in key groups, and improve coordination.
- Reduce neuropathic pain to VAS ≤2 and minimize impact on daily function.
- Achieve Modified Barthel Index ≥80 (basic ADLs mostly independent).
- Improve cognitive function scores (MMSE ≥26, MoCA ≥24) and emotional stability.
- Achieve healthy BMI target (~65–70 kg) through nutritional rehabilitation.
- Return to basic household and light farm-related activities within safety limits.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### (1) Physical Therapy (PT)
- **Positioning & Passive Range of Motion (PROM):** Daily to maintain joint mobility, prevent contractures.
- **Muscle Strengthening:**  
  - Proximal lower limb muscles: resistive exercises for gluteals, quadriceps, hamstrings.  
  - Ankle dorsiflexors/plantarflexors: active-assisted progressing to resisted training.  
  - Upper limb strengthening to support transfers and ADL independence.
- **Balance & Coordination Training:**  
  - Sitting balance exercises with reaching tasks, progressing to dynamic trunk control.  
  - Supported standing frame training as tolerated to stimulate postural muscles, enhance bone density, and improve cardiovascular tolerance.  
  - Coordination drills (heel-to-shin in sitting, alternating movements) within safe limits.
- **Gait-related Training:** Once standing balance improves, initiate parallel bar gait training with orthoses if indicated.
- **Neuromuscular Re-education:** Proprioceptive and kinesthetic retraining using visual feedback, tactile cues.

### (2) Occupational Therapy (OT)
- **ADL Training:** Dressing, grooming, toileting practice with adaptive equipment; transfer techniques using sliding board or pivot transfer.
- **Fine Motor Training:** Improve hand dexterity for feeding, buttoning, and writing.
- **Energy Conservation & Work Simplification:** Teach pacing strategies.
- **Home & Worksite Modification:** Recommendations for accessibility and fall prevention.

### (3) Pain Management
- **Modalities:** Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for neuropathic pain in feet; warm compress to improve circulation.
- **Pharmacologic coordination:** Work with neurology for agents such as pregabalin or duloxetine if appropriate, monitor side effects.
- **Mind–body approaches:** Relaxation training, breathing exercises to reduce pain perception.

### (4) Cognitive & Psychological Intervention
- **Cognitive Training:** Memory, attention, and executive function exercises.
- **Psychological Support:** Counseling, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to address anxiety and mood instability.
- **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Optimize sleep environment, schedule, and relaxation techniques.

### (5) Nutritional Support
- **Dietitian Consultation:** High-protein, high-calorie diet with adequate vitamins, particularly vitamin B₁₂, folate, and other B vitamins as per deficiency.
- **Oral supplementation:** Vitamin B₁₂ replacement (parenteral initially if indicated) per neurology orders; folate supplementation.
- **Monitor weight, serum albumin, and micronutrient levels regularly.**

### (6) Medical Management & Monitoring
- **Blood Pressure Control:** Continue antihypertensive regimen, monitor regularly.
- **VTE Prophylaxis:** Mechanical (ankle pump exercises, compression stockings) and pharmacologic prophylaxis per physician orders considering moderate risk.
- **Skin Care:** Daily inspection, pressure relief measures (air cushion, regular repositioning).
- **Bladder Training:** Timed voiding, pelvic floor exercises if feasible, monitor for urinary tract infection.

### (7) Patient & Family Education
- Disease process, rehabilitation importance, home exercise program.
- Safe transfer techniques, fall prevention, and emergency handling.
- Importance of medication adherence and follow-up appointments.

### (8) Rehabilitation Schedule
- PT: 40–60 minutes/day, 5–6 days/week.
- OT: 30–40 minutes/day, 5 days/week.
- Cognitive/psychological session: 2–3 times/week.
- Home exercise program reinforced daily by patient/family.
