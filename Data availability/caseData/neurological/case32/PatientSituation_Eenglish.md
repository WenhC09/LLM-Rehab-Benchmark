# Medical Record Information

## I. Case Summary

**Patient**: Male, 43 years old, Uyghur ethnicity, farmer.  

**Chief Complaint**: Progressive limb pain and numbness with walking difficulty for 17 months.  

**History of Present Illness**:  
The patient reported persistent watery diarrhea occurring several times daily since December 2018. During this period, he experienced cold sensation in soles, unsteady gait ("walking on cotton" sensation), and occasional needle-like pain in soles while standing.  
After 1 month of unresolved diarrhea, he was admitted to a local hospital gastroenterology department. Diagnosed with "Functional Abdominal Pain Syndrome, Sepsis, Moderate Protein-Energy Malnutrition, Pulmonary Infection". Treated with fluid replacement, vitamin supplementation, and anti-inflammatory therapy. Bowel movements normalized upon discharge, but limb discomfort progressively worsened. Developed persistent burning pain in soles, lower limb numbness ascending to the abdomen, bilateral lower limb weakness, and unsteady gait.  
In July 2019, visited neurology department at a local hospital. Diagnosed with "Subacute Combined Degeneration of Spinal Cord". Received intravenous methylcobalamin, intramuscular vitamin B₁, and oral folic acid. Pain slightly improved; discharged with walking assistance.  
Post-discharge, failed to maintain regular medication due to various reasons. Pain worsened in both feet and upper limbs developed numbness after 5 months of discontinuation. Experienced difficulty turning over in bed. Bilateral lower limbs could elevate off bed surface but exhibited poor active ankle motion.  
Currently: Can sit independently but requires assistance from two persons to stand (exhibits forward trunk flexion). Unable to walk independently. Most activities of daily living (ADL) – transfers, toileting, bathing – require assistance, severely impacting normal life and work.  
Admitted to our hospital’s neurology department on April 29, 2020, for further management. Transferred to rehabilitation department on May 5, 2020, with "Subacute Combined Degeneration of Spinal Cord".  
**Course**: Alert, poor spirits, emotional instability, irritability. Normal appetite. Poor sleep due to nocturnal pain. Increased urinary frequency. Formed stools. Significant weight loss (20kg over the past year).  

**Past Medical History**:  
Hypertension for 1 year (peak BP 180/100 mmHg). Maintained on Amlodipine Besylate tablets. Denies history of infectious diseases, psychiatric disorders, or occupational diseases.  

**Family History**:  
Denies family history of genetic disorders or similar diseases.  

**Personal History**:  
Primary school education. No exposure to chemicals, radiation, or toxins. Denies high-risk sexual behavior or illicit drug use. Smoking and alcohol consumption for 25 years (~10 cigarettes/day; occasional white liquor intake 100-300mL/year).  

**Diagnoses**:
*   Subacute Combined Degeneration of Spinal Cord
*   Peripheral Neuropathy
*   Neuropathic Pain
*   Severe Ataxia and Balance Impairment
*   Moderate Dependence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL)
*   Mild Cognitive Impairment
*   Anxiety State
*   Malnutrition
*   Hypertension
*   Moderate Risk for Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)
