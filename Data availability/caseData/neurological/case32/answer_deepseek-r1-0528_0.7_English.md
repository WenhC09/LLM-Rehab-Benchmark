### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

#### 1. Rehabilitation Goals
**Short-term goals (4-6 weeks):**
- Reduce neuropathic pain intensity (VAS score from 6 to ≤4).
- Improve lower limb strength: Ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion from grade 3 to 4-, gluteus maximus from grade 2 to 3+.
- Achieve independent bed mobility (turning, sitting edge of bed).
- Progress standing balance from level 0 to level II (minimal assistance).
- Increase Berg Balance Scale score from 4 to ≥12.
- Enhance basic ADL independence: Modified Barthel Index from 50 to ≥65 (partial independence in grooming, dressing, toileting).
- Mitigate anxiety symptoms (HAMA score from 15 to ≤10).
- Prevent complications: VTE, pressure injuries, and falls.

**Long-term goals (3-6 months):**
- Attain assisted household ambulation (walker or crutches).
- Restore modified Barthel Index to ≥85 (minimal assistance for transfers/walking).
- Achieve standing balance level III (independent).
- Normalize Berg Balance Scale to ≥40 (low fall risk).
- Resolve neuropathic pain (VAS ≤2).
- Improve cognitive function (MoCA from 19 to ≥22).
- Restore weight to healthy range (target BMI ≥18.5, ~65kg).

#### 2. Treatment Methods
**A. Physical Therapy**  
- *Strength Training:*  
  - Progressive resistance exercises for lower limbs: Focus on gluteals (bridging, side-lying abduction), quadriceps (mini-squats), and ankle DF/PF (resistance bands).  
  - Frequency: 5×/week, 3 sets × 10 reps, low-load/high-repetition.  
- *Balance and Coordination:*  
  - Frenkel exercises for ataxia management (supine → sitting → standing progression).  
  - Static balance training: Weight-shifting in parallel bars, tandem stance.  
  - Dynamic balance: Ball throws while seated, heel-to-toe walking (assisted).  
- *Gait Training:*  
  - Partial weight-bearing treadmill training → overground walking with walker.  
  - Focus on cadence, step symmetry, and upright posture.  
- *Sensory Re-education:*  
  - Texture discrimination and proprioceptive training (joint positioning drills).  

**B. Occupational Therapy**  
- *ADL Retraining:*  
  - Task-specific training for grooming, dressing, and transfers (bed ↔ wheelchair).  
  - Adaptive equipment: Long-handled reacher, shower chair, raised toilet seat.  
- *Upper Limb Function:*  
  - Fine motor coordination exercises (pegboard, stacking cones).  
  - Desensitization techniques for hand numbness.  
- *Energy Conservation Education:* Pacing strategies for daily tasks.  

**C. Pain Management**  
- *Modalities:* Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) for bilateral soles.  
- *Therapeutic Activities:* Aquatic therapy (warm water) to reduce mechanical stress.  
- *Pharmacological Coordination:* Collaborate with physician for neuropathic pain agents (e.g., gabapentin).  

**D. Neuromotor Re-education**  
- Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) patterns for trunk/lower limbs.  
- Vestibular training: Eye-head coordination drills, optokinetic stimulation.  

**E. Cognitive and Psychological Support**  
- *Cognitive Rehabilitation:* Paper-pencil tasks for attention/executive function (e.g., trail-making).  
- *Anxiety Management:* Relaxation techniques (diaphragmatic breathing), graded activity scheduling.  

**F. Medical and Nutritional Management**  
- *VTE Prophylaxis:* Daily compression stockings + intermittent pneumatic compression.  
- *Nutritional Optimization:* High-protein/calorie diet + vitamin B12/folate supplementation (per neurology).  
- *Blood Pressure Monitoring:* Daily checks during therapy sessions.  

**G. Safety and Prevention**  
- Fall prevention: Bed alarms, non-slip footwear, home hazard assessment.  
- Skin integrity: Pressure relief education, 2-hour turning schedule.  
- Family training: Assisted transfer techniques, home exercise program (HEP).  

**Frequency:**  
- PT/OT: 60 mins × 5 days/week  
- Cognitive/psychological: 30 mins × 3 days/week  
- Re-assessment intervals: Biweekly for goals, monthly for biomarkers (B12, homocysteine).
