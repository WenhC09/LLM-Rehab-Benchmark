# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4-6 weeks):
*   **Pain Management:** Reduce bilateral foot pain from VAS 6 to â‰¤ 3 to improve sleep quality and participation in therapy.
*   **Bed Mobility and Transfers:** Achieve independence in turning over in bed and moving from lying to sitting. Achieve modified independence in transfers between bed, wheelchair, and toilet, possibly using a sliding board.
*   **Muscle Strength:** Improve strength of key lower limb muscles by at least 0.5-1 grade on the MMT scale, specifically targeting gluteus maximus (from 2 to 2+), ankle dorsiflexors, and plantarflexors (from 3 to 3+).
*   **Sitting Balance:** Improve static and dynamic sitting balance to allow for unsupported sitting for >15 minutes while performing upper limb activities.
*   **Complication Prevention:** Prevent venous thromboembolism, pressure sores, and joint contractures through regular repositioning, skin checks, and range of motion exercises.
*   **Patient Education:** Ensure the patient and his family can verbalize the diagnosis, the critical importance of lifelong vitamin B12 therapy, and the basic principles of fall prevention.
*   **Emotional Regulation:** Reduce anxiety symptoms and improve emotional stability to facilitate active participation in rehabilitation sessions.

### Long-term goals (within 3-6 months):
*   **Mobility:** Achieve supervised ambulation for household distances (approx. 15 meters) using a high walker or other appropriate assistive device, employing visual compensatory strategies.
*   **Balance:** Achieve the ability to stand with minimal assistance in parallel bars for at least 2 minutes. Improve Berg Balance Scale score to > 20 to decrease fall risk during assisted transfers and standing.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):** Achieve modified independence in all basic ADLs (MBI score > 75), including self-care, toileting, and dressing, with the use of adaptive equipment as needed.
*   **Functional Independence:** Establish a safe and effective home exercise program to maintain strength, range of motion, and cardiovascular fitness.
*   **Cognitive Function:** Improve functional cognition for managing daily routines and medication schedules independently with the use of compensatory aids.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### (A) Medical Management
1.  **Nutritional and Vitamin Therapy:**
    *   Immediate and aggressive Vitamin B12 supplementation as per neurology protocol (initially intramuscular, transitioning to a sustainable long-term regimen).
    *   Nutritional consultation to address malnutrition (BMI 17.3). Implement a high-protein, high-calorie diet. Monitor weight and albumin levels.
2.  **Pharmacotherapy:**
    *   **Neuropathic Pain:** Initiate medication such as gabapentin or pregabalin, titrating the dose for optimal pain relief and minimal side effects.
    *   **Anxiety:** Provide psychological support. Consider short-term use of anxiolytics if anxiety (HAMA 15) significantly impedes rehabilitation.
    *   **VTE Prophylaxis:** Continue prophylactic measures (e.g., low-molecular-weight heparin or intermittent pneumatic compression devices) until mobility improves significantly, based on reassessment of VTE risk.

### (B) Physical Therapy (PT)
1.  **Strength Training:**
    *   Progressive resistance exercises for all four limbs, with emphasis on the lower extremities.
    *   **Lower Limbs:** Focus on hip extensors and abductors (gluteus maximus/medius), knee extensors (quadriceps), and ankle dorsiflexors/plantarflexors. Start with active-assisted or active exercises in gravity-eliminated positions, progressing to against-gravity and resistance training as strength improves.
    *   **Core Stability:** Intensive training for trunk muscles (abdominals, obliques, back extensors) in sitting and supine positions to provide a stable base for limb movement.
2.  **Balance and Coordination Training:**
    *   **Sitting Balance:** Start with static sitting on a firm surface, progressing to dynamic activities (reaching, turning) and sitting on unstable surfaces (e.g., foam cushion).
    *   **Standing Balance:** Begin with supported standing in a standing frame or parallel bars to ensure safety. Focus on static standing, weight shifting, and visual feedback using a mirror.
    *   **Frenkel's Exercises:** Implement systematic, slow, and repetitive coordination exercises for both upper and lower limbs, emphasizing intense visual concentration to compensate for proprioceptive loss.
3.  **Sensory Compensation Training:**
    *   Explicitly train the patient to use vision to guide limb placement during all movements (e.g., looking at his feet while transferring or walking).
    *   Use sensory stimulation techniques (e.g., brushing, different textures) on the feet and legs to potentially enhance any residual sensory input, though primary reliance will be on visual substitution.
4.  **Mobility and Gait Training:**
    *   **Transfer Training:** Practice transfers (bed-to-chair, chair-to-toilet) with correct technique, progressing from sliding board to stand-pivot transfers as lower limb strength and balance improve.
    *   **Pre-gait Activities:** In parallel bars, practice weight shifting, marching in place, and taking single steps.
    *   **Gait Training:** When sufficient standing balance is achieved, initiate gait training in parallel bars, progressing to a high walker. Emphasize a wide base of support and conscious visual monitoring of foot placement.
5.  **Range of Motion and Flexibility:**
    *   Daily passive and active-assisted range of motion exercises for all major joints, with particular attention to preventing ankle plantarflexion contractures (Achilles tendon tightness).

### (C) Occupational Therapy (OT)
1.  **ADL Retraining:**
    *   Train in self-care tasks (grooming, dressing, bathing) using adaptive strategies and equipment (e.g., long-handled shoe horn, sock aid, buttonhook, long-handled sponge, shower chair, grab bars).
    *   Focus on energy conservation and work simplification techniques.
2.  **Upper Limb Function:**
    *   Address upper limb ataxia and poor fine motor skills with specific activities (e.g., theraputty exercises, pegboards, stacking cones, writing practice) to improve dexterity for functional tasks.
3.  **Cognitive Rehabilitation:**
    *   Address cognitive deficits (MoCA 19) with targeted interventions.
    *   Introduce compensatory strategies such as a memory notebook, daily planner, and alarms for medication and appointment reminders.
    *   Break down complex tasks into simple, manageable steps.
4.  **Environmental Assessment and Modification:**
    *   Provide recommendations for home modifications to ensure safety and accessibility, including installing grab bars, removing throw rugs, improving lighting, and obtaining a raised toilet seat.
    *   Prescribe and train in the use of a suitable wheelchair for community mobility.

### (D) Psychological Support
1.  **Counseling:** Provide individual and family counseling to address emotional lability, irritability, anxiety, and the psychological impact of a severe chronic illness.
2.  **Behavioral Strategies:** Teach coping mechanisms and relaxation techniques to manage anxiety and pain.
3.  **Education:** Involve the family in the rehabilitation process to build a strong support system and ensure understanding and adherence to the treatment plan post-discharge.
