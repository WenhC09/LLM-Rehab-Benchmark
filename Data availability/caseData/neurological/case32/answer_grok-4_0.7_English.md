# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks):
- **Pain Management**: Reduce neuropathic pain (VAS score) from 6 to ≤4 in bilateral feet.
- **Motor Function**: Improve lower limb muscle strength (MMT) by at least 0.5–1 grade in key muscle groups (gluteus maximus, ankle dorsiflexors/plantarflexors).
- **Balance and Coordination**: Achieve sitting balance Level IV and standing balance Level I with assistive devices.
- **ADL Independence**: Increase Modified Barthel Index score to ≥65, enabling partial independence in grooming, dressing, and transfers.
- **Mood and Sleep**: Reduce Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) score to ≤12 and improve sleep quality by addressing nocturnal pain.
- **Nutritional Status**: Stabilize weight and improve albumin levels to ≥40 g/L through nutritional support.

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
- **Pain Control**: Achieve sustained neuropathic pain reduction (VAS ≤2–3) to support functional activities.
- **Motor Recovery**: Attain MMT grade ≥4 in lower limb key muscle groups to support assisted ambulation with a walker.
- **Balance and Mobility**: Achieve standing balance Level II and initiate assisted ambulation for short distances (≥10 meters).
- **ADL Independence**: Achieve Modified Barthel Index score ≥80, enabling near-complete independence in basic ADLs (excluding stair climbing).
- **Cognitive and Mood Improvement**: Improve MoCA score to ≥22 and HAMA score to ≤10, supporting emotional stability and cognitive function.
- **VTE Prevention**: Maintain moderate VTE risk (Caprini score ≤4) with no clinical evidence of thromboembolism.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### (1) Pharmacological and Nutritional Interventions
- **Vitamin B12 Supplementation**: Continue intravenous methylcobalamin (1 mg/day for 2 weeks, then 500 µg/week) to address severe vitamin B12 deficiency (91 pg/mL) and elevated homocysteine (>50 µmol/L).
- **Folic Acid**: Oral folic acid (5 mg/day) to correct low serum folate (4.52 ng/mL) and support neurological recovery.
- **Neuropathic Pain Management**: Initiate gabapentin (start 300 mg/day, titrate to 900–1800 mg/day in divided doses) to target burning pain and hyperesthesia in soles (VAS 6).
- **Nutritional Support**: High-protein, high-calorie diet (2000–2500 kcal/day, 1.5 g/kg protein) with dietician consultation to address malnutrition (albumin 38 g/L, 20 kg weight loss). Supplement with multivitamins and trace elements.
- **Hypertension Control**: Continue amlodipine besylate (5 mg/day) to maintain BP ≤140/90 mmHg.
- **VTE Prophylaxis**: Low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 40 mg/day subcutaneously) for 4 weeks, combined with compression stockings, given moderate VTE risk (Caprini score 4).

### (2) Physical Therapy
- **Strength Training**: 
  - Passive range of motion (ROM) exercises for lower limbs (10–15 reps/joint, 2 sessions/day) to maintain joint mobility.
  - Progressive resistance training for lower limbs (gluteus maximus, quadriceps, ankle dorsiflexors/plantarflexors) using body weight or light resistance (1–2 kg, 10 reps/set, 2–3 sets/day) to improve MMT grades.
  - Upper limb strengthening with light dumbbells (0.5–1 kg, 10–15 reps/set, 2 sets/day) to support transfers.
- **Balance and Coordination Training**:
  - Sitting balance exercises (e.g., weight shifting, reaching tasks) on stable surfaces (30 min/day) to progress to Level IV.
  - Standing balance training with parallel bars and assistive devices (10–15 min/day) to achieve Level I.
  - Coordination exercises (e.g., finger-to-nose, heel-to-shin practice) to address ataxia (15 min/day).
- **Transfer Training**: Practice bed-to-chair transfers with sliding board and one-person assistance (10–15 reps/day) to enhance ADL independence.

### (3) Occupational Therapy
- **ADL Training**: Focus on grooming, dressing, and toileting with adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled tools, raised toilet seat) to improve Modified Barthel Index score (30 min/day).
- **Fine Motor Skills**: Hand-eye coordination tasks (e.g., pegboard exercises, buttoning practice) to address clumsy rapid alternating movements (15–20 min/day).
- **Cognitive Training**: Task-specific exercises (e.g., memory games, simple problem-solving) to improve MoCA score (20 min/day, 5 days/week).

### (4) Psychological and Behavioral Interventions
- **Anxiety Management**: Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions (1 hour/week) to address anxiety (HAMA 15) and emotional instability.
- **Sleep Hygiene**: Educate on sleep hygiene practices (e.g., consistent sleep schedule, avoiding stimulants) combined with pain management to reduce nocturnal pain interference.
- **Motivational Support**: Weekly counseling to improve patient engagement and address poor spirits (30 min/session).

### (5) Assistive Devices and Orthotics
- **Mobility Aids**: Provide a lightweight wheelchair for mobility and a four-point walker for standing balance training.
- **Orthotics**: Bilateral ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) to support weak ankle dorsiflexors/plantarflexors (MMT grade 3) during standing and transfer activities.

### (6) Monitoring and Follow-up
- **Weekly Assessments**:
  - Pain: Monitor VAS score and adjust gabapentin dosage as needed.
  - Muscle Strength: Reassess MMT scores for lower limbs.
  - Balance: Evaluate sitting/standing balance levels and Berg Balance Scale.
  - ADL: Track Modified Barthel Index score.
- **Monthly Assessments**:
  - Nutritional Status: Monitor weight, albumin, and homocysteine levels.
  - Cognitive/Mood: Reassess MoCA and HAMA scores.
  - VTE Risk: Review Caprini score and clinical signs of thromboembolism.
- **Adjustments**: Modify exercise intensity and assistive device use based on progress. Transition to oral vitamin B12 (1000 µg/day) if laboratory parameters improve.

### (7) Patient and Family Education
- Educate patient and caregivers on subacute combined degeneration, emphasizing adherence to vitamin supplementation and medication.
- Train family on safe transfer techniques and use of assistive devices to support ADL.
- Provide dietary guidance to ensure adequate caloric and protein intake.
