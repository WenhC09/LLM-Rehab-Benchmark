# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Improve pain management to reduce Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score from 6 to 3 within 4 weeks.
- Enhance lower limb muscle strength, aiming for a minimum increase of one grade in gluteus maximus and gluteus medius strength within 6 weeks.
- Achieve independent sitting balance and improve standing balance to level I within 6 weeks.
- Increase the Modified Barthel Index score by at least 10 points within 4 weeks.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve independent ambulation with or without assistive devices within 6 months.
- Improve overall functional independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) to a Modified Barthel Index score of 80 or above within 6 months.
- Enhance cognitive function, aiming for a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 26 or above within 6 months.
- Address emotional well-being, reducing Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) score to below 10 within 6 months.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### A. Pain Management
- Initiate a multimodal pain management approach including:
  - Pharmacological interventions: Continue methylcobalamin, vitamin B1, and folic acid supplementation. Consider adding gabapentin or pregabalin for neuropathic pain management.
  - Non-pharmacological interventions: Implement transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy for pain relief.

### B. Physical Rehabilitation
- **Strength Training**: 
  - Focus on progressive resistance exercises for lower limbs, targeting gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, quadriceps, and hamstrings.
  - Incorporate functional exercises such as sit-to-stand and step-ups to enhance strength and stability.

- **Balance and Coordination Training**:
  - Utilize balance training exercises such as standing on one leg, tandem walking, and dynamic balance activities.
  - Implement coordination exercises like finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tasks to improve fine motor skills.

- **Gait Training**:
  - Initiate gait training with parallel bars or a walker, focusing on weight shifting and stepping patterns.
  - Gradually progress to overground walking as strength and balance improve.

### C. Occupational Therapy
- Provide training in activities of daily living (ADLs) to promote independence, including grooming, dressing, and toileting.
- Introduce adaptive equipment as needed to facilitate independence in daily tasks.

### D. Cognitive and Emotional Support
- Implement cognitive rehabilitation strategies to enhance cognitive function, including memory exercises and problem-solving tasks.
- Provide psychological support through counseling or cognitive-behavioral therapy to address anxiety and emotional instability.

### E. Nutritional Support
- Collaborate with a dietitian to develop a nutritional plan aimed at addressing protein-energy malnutrition and promoting weight gain.
- Monitor dietary intake and provide education on balanced nutrition to support recovery.

### F. Monitoring and Follow-up
- Schedule regular follow-up assessments every 2 weeks to monitor progress towards rehabilitation goals and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.
- Conduct interdisciplinary team meetings to ensure comprehensive care and address any emerging issues promptly.
