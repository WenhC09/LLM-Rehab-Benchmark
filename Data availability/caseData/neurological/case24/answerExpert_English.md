### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

*   **Short-term Goals:**
    *   Improve patient's orientation and short-term memory;
    *   Achieve independent bed-chair transfer, feeding, and dressing abilities.
*   **Long-term Goals:**
    *   Improve patient's attention and long-term memory;
    *   Achieve assisted ambulation ability;
    *   Achieve basic activities of daily living (ADL) independence, including community activities such as supermarket shopping;
    *   Ultimate goal: Return to normal family life and resume occupational duties.

### 2. Treatment Methods

A comprehensive, individualized rehabilitation plan focusing on cognitive rehabilitation and motor rehabilitation, combined with psychological support, is formulated to address the patient's issues including cognitive impairment, motor dysfunction, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia.

**I. Cognitive Rehabilitation**

Adopt a comprehensive training model centered on cognitive training, integrated with risk factor management, lifestyle intervention, exercise and nutrition prescription, sleep and mood adjustment. Supplemented with music therapy and repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). Cognitive training combines computer-assisted systems and manual training sessions, administered 5 days per week, twice daily, for over 30 minutes per session, over a 2-month period. Specific training includes:

*   **Orientation Training:** Utilize cueing tools such as calendars and clocks to assist the patient in distinguishing dates and estimating time points.
*   **Attention Training:** Follow a stepwise progression: vigilance training, selective and shifting attention training, concluding with divided and integrated attention training. Incorporate eye movement training and visual search exercises to simultaneously train ophthalmoplegia function while improving attention.
*   **Memory Training (Core Focus):** Progress from simple to complex tasks. Initial phase: Basic exercises like card memory, immediate recall, picture matching. Intermediate phase: Increase difficulty using daily life scenarios, e.g., simulated phone answering and message recording, prospective memory training (e.g., reminding self to take medication on time). Advanced phase: Apply training effects to real life, requiring the patient to remember daily rehabilitation schedules, medication status, and independently complete complex tasks like supermarket shopping.
*   **Executive Function Training:** Initiate after improvement in memory and attention. Includes inhibitory control training and timed switching task training.

**II. Motor Function Rehabilitation**

A phased Occupational Therapy (OT) and Physical Therapy (PT) program addresses poor trunk and limb muscle strength/endurance, sensory diminution, ataxia, and impaired balance and ambulation.

*   **Phase I:**
    *   **Occupational Therapy (OT):** Focus on improving sitting endurance and upper limb function. Training includes seated ball throwing/catching in various directions, upper limb bar exercises with progressive weight increase, and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) training (e.g., supine-to-sit rolling, bed-wheelchair transfer, grooming, dressing).
    *   **Physical Therapy (PT):** Focus on improving core control and lower limb strength. Training includes trunk/core muscle strengthening (e.g., double bridge exercises, suspension system training), quadriceps isometric contractions, and static balance training (applying loads in different positions to stimulate postural reflexes).
    *   **Assessment & Adjustment:** Balance platform assessment revealed poor right ankle Average Track Error (ATE), weaker posterior ankle strength compared to anterior, and overall poor proprioception and strength. Targeted right ankle strength and proprioception training was added to the plan, emphasizing safety during transfers and ambulation.

*   **Phase II:**
    *   **Occupational Therapy (OT):** Enhance upper limb coordination, wrist flexibility, and sitting endurance. Training includes seated ball throwing/catching with weights, ring tossing, rapid bilateral upper limb clapping overhead, and higher-level ADL training (e.g., sit-to-stand transfers, toilet training).
    *   **Physical Therapy (PT):** Focus on improving ankle control and ambulation ability. Training includes unilateral weight-bearing and stepping drills in standing, ankle proprioception training (using Bobath ball and balance device ankle modules), advanced trunk/core strengthening (e.g., single bridge exercises), and initiation of ambulation training with a walker.

*   **Phase III:**
    *   **Occupational Therapy (OT):** Continue strengthening upper limb strength and wrist flexibility. Training includes weighted ring tossing, rapid bilateral arm raises with weights, and consolidation of ADL abilities like sit-to-stand transfers and toileting.
    *   **Physical Therapy (PT):** Address persistent weakness in ankle control, standing balance, and ambulation ability, alongside fear of walking. Continue joint proprioception training, quadriceps maximal contraction training, standing ball throwing/catching to improve dynamic balance, and advanced core strengthening using the suspension system.

**III. Psychological Intervention & Discharge Guidance**

*   **Psychological Intervention:** Provide timely psychological counseling during rehabilitation to address the patient's fear and excessive anxiety related to ambulation training.
*   **Discharge Guidance:** Instruct the patient on continuing rehabilitation in the home environment. Encourage using tools and daily events to improve time orientation; enhance attention and memory through games; actively participate in household chores and attempt outdoor activities to enrich environmental stimulation; and continue proprioception, core/lower limb strength, and ambulation training to prepare for eventual community reintegration and return to work.
