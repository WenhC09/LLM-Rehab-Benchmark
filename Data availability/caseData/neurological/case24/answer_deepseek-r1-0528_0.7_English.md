# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (4-6 weeks):
- Improve lower limb strength: Achieve MMT left LE 4-/5, right LE 4+/5
- Achieve standing balance with bilateral support for 30 seconds
- Increase ADL independence: Barthel Index to 50/100 (specifically: independent feeding, minimal assistance dressing, supervised toileting)
- Enhance sensory discrimination in left palmar region and bilateral lower limbs
- Improve working memory: Digit Span Backward to 6 items
- Reduce fatigue impact: FSS score ≤35/63
- Initiate weight-bearing progression: Stand with parallel bar support

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve functional ambulation: Walk 10m with rolling walker and minimal assistance
- Restore ADL independence: Barthel Index ≥85/100
- Improve dynamic balance: Ambulate on level surfaces without assistive device supervision
- Normalize right ankle proprioception: Balance platform error <40%
- Resolve diplopia through compensatory strategies or recovery
- Return to community participation: Independent household management

## 2. Treatment Methods
### Physical Therapy
- **Neuromuscular Re-education**  
  - Progressive resistance training: Focus on quadriceps (isometric→isotonic) using ankle weights (start 0.5kg)  
  - Proprioceptive training: Right ankle perturbations on unstable surfaces (foam→wobble board)  
  - Weight-bearing progression: Parallel bar standing → weight shifting → step training  
- **Gait Training**  
  - Body-weight supported treadmill training (BWS 40% initial)  
  - Overground ambulation training with front-wheel walker  
- **Balance Training**  
  - Static→dynamic sitting balance on therapy ball  
  - Standing balance with bilateral upper limb support  
- **Sensory Re-education**  
  - Texture discrimination training for left hand  
  - Joint position sense training for ankles  

### Occupational Therapy
- **ADL Retraining**  
  - Task-specific dressing training (adaptive clothing techniques)  
  - Toileting transfers with grab bar simulation  
  - Energy conservation strategies for grooming/bathing  
- **Upper Extremity Function**  
  - Fine motor coordination: Pegboard tasks with sensory feedback  
  - Writing rehabilitation: Graded graphomotor exercises  
- **Cognitive Rehabilitation**  
  - Attention training: Computerized attention process training (CAPT)  
  - Memory compensation: External memory aid implementation (smartphone reminders)  
  - Executive function: Meal planning and preparation tasks  

### Vision Rehabilitation
- Oculomotor training: Smooth pursuit and saccadic eye exercises  
- Prism adaptation trial for diplopia management  
- Visual scanning strategies during mobility tasks  

### Medical Management
- **Nutritional Optimization**  
  - High-calorie/high-protein diet (1.5g protein/kg/day) with thiamine supplementation  
  - Diabetes-appropriate meal timing for exercise sessions  
- **Seizure Precautions**  
  - Environmental modification (reduce strobing lights)  
  - Activity pacing to prevent hyperventilation-induced events  
- **Neuropathic Pain Prevention**  
  - Sensory desensitization protocols  
  - Night splinting for ankle positioning  

### Adjunctive Therapies
- **Aquatic Therapy**  
  - Buoyancy-assisted lower limb strengthening  
  - Hydrodynamic balance challenges  
- **Functional Electrical Stimulation**  
  - Quadriceps and tibialis anterior stimulation during gait training  
- **Psychological Support**  
  - Cognitive-behavioral strategies for activity pacing  
  - Relaxation training for fatigue management  

### Parameters & Precautions
- **Frequency**: PT 5x/week, OT 5x/week, Vision 2x/week  
- **Precautions**:  
  - Cardiac monitoring during aerobic activities (baseline HR 65bpm)  
  - Blood glucose monitoring pre/post therapy (Type 2 DM)  
  - Fall prevention: Mandatory gait belt during transfers  
  - Seizure response protocol during all sessions  
- **Progress Indicators**:  
  - Biweekly MMT and balance platform reassessment  
  - Weekly Barthel Index and FSS tracking  
  - Monthly EMG for neuropathic recovery monitoring
