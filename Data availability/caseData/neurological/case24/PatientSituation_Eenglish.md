# Patient Medical Record

## I. Clinical Summary

**Basic Information**: Male, 31 years old, college-educated, right-handed.

**Chief Complaint**: Impaired mobility and numbness in both lower limbs for over 2 months.

**Present Illness**:  
The patient was admitted to the Gastroenterology Department on August 13, 2021, for recurrent acute pancreatitis. During hospitalization, he experienced recurrent vomiting and reduced oral intake (primarily plant-based diet). On day 6 of admission (August 18, 2021), he developed lethargy, drowsiness, incoherent speech, dysphagia, bilateral lower limb weakness with numbness (left > right). Both lower limbs could still be lifted off the bed spontaneously. He reported urinary retention.  
Emergency cranial MRI revealed abnormal signal in the splenium of corpus callosum, suggestive of reversible splenial lesion syndrome. The next day, lower limb weakness worsened significantly (unable to lift limbs off bed, only minimal sliding movements). Upper limb motor function remained intact, but distal numbness developed (distal to elbows).  
Neurology consultation considered "Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis? Reversible Splenial Lesion Syndrome? Wernicke's Encephalopathy?". Transferred to Neurology Department for intravenous immunoglobulin, B-complex vitamins supplementation, anti-infection therapy, fluid resuscitation, and electrolyte correction.  
Following consultation with Huashan Hospital experts, "Wernicke's Encephalopathy" was confirmed. Consciousness gradually improved. Further tests included electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), and repeat cranial MRI. Complications during admission: epileptic seizures, diabetes mellitus, anemia, electrolyte disturbances; managed with antiepileptics, hypoglycemic agents, iron supplementation, and electrolyte correction.  
Bedside rehabilitation commenced during neurology admission (passive limb mobilization, active lower limb strengthening). After 4 days of training (September 10, 2021), gradual functional recovery noted: normal daily communication, no dysphagia, mild recent memory decline. Upper limb numbness improved (residual palmar numbness in left hand). Mild upper limb weakness with writing difficulty. Lower limb numbness slightly improved; both limbs liftable off bed (left > right). Able to sit independently. Unable to stand alone. Normal bowel/bladder function. Moderate assistance required for dressing/eating; full dependence for bathing, grooming, toileting, and bed-chair transfers. Discharged thereafter.  
Readmitted on October 22, 2021, for rehabilitation with diagnosis of "Wernicke's Encephalopathy". Throughout course: mild lethargy, normal sleep, normal bowel/bladder function, significant weight loss (~30 kg).

**Past History**:  
- Hospitalized for pancreatitis (June 4, 2021 & August 8, 2021)  
- Grade II meniscus injury (3 years prior)  
- Appendectomy (17 years prior)  
- Tonsillectomy (5 years prior)  
- Non-smoker, non-drinker  

**Family History**: Denies family history of genetic or similar disorders.

**Physical Examination**:  
Temp 36.8Â°C, HR 65 bpm, RR 14/min, BP 116/71 mmHg. Conscious, normally developed, malnourished, emaciated appearance. Wheeled in on gurney. Oriented and cooperative. Clear lung sounds, no rales. Cardiac exam unremarkable. Old surgical scar on abdomen. Remainder unremarkable.

**Neurological Examination**:  
Conscious, alert. Spontaneous speech fluent/clear. Follows 2-step commands. Normal reading/repetition. Symmetric forehead wrinkles. Pupils equal/round (2.5mm), reactive to light. Bilateral abduction limitation with horizontal nystagmus. Gross visual fields intact. Normal hearing. Symmetric nasolabial folds. Tongue midline. Normal cheek puffing/teeth showing. Normal gag reflex.  
*ROM*: Full passive ROM bilaterally.  
*Muscle Tone (Modified Ashworth)*: Normal throughout.  
*Sensation*: Hypoesthesia in left upper limb and both lower limbs (superficial); intact right upper limb. Normal deep sensation bilaterally.  
*Coordination*: Left finger-nose test unsteady. Impaired heel-shin test bilaterally (limited by strength).  
*Reflexes*: Reduced left biceps/knee/ankle jerks. Negative bilateral plantar reflexes.

**Diagnoses**:  
1.  Wernicke's Encephalopathy  
2.  Peripheral Neuropathy  
3.  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  
4.  Symptomatic Epilepsy (Secondary Epilepsy)  
5.  Malnutrition  
6.  Anemia  
7.  Electrolyte Imbalance  

**Functional Impairments**:  
1.  Cognitive Impairment  
2.  Extraocular Muscle Palsy  
3.  Motor Dysfunction  
4.  Hypoesthesia  
5.  Ataxia  
6.  Impaired Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
7.  Impaired Social Participation

*   **Attention Tests**:  
    *   *Attention Span (Digit Span)*: Forward: 8; Backward: 5  
    *   *Sustained Attention (Cancellation Test: digit '3')*: Net score 32, error rate 0%, time 158s  
    *   *Selective Attention (Cancellation: digit before '3')*: Net score 23.5, error rate 12.96%, time 171s

*   **EEG (Aug 26, 2021)**: Moderately abnormal (generalized background slowing, increased slow waves).  
*   **EEG (Oct 9, 2021)**: Normal (alpha rhythm).  
*   **Functional MRI**: Reduced activation in relevant brain regions during short-term (memorizing 15 target images) and long-term memory tasks (recognizing targets from 30 images). Prolonged reaction time (Patient: 1303ms vs Control: 842ms). Reduced correct responses (Patient: 8 vs Control: 14).  
*   **Balance Platform Assessment**: Impaired right ankle multi-axis proprioception. Average Tracking Error (ATE): 92% (Normal <20%). Force vector diagram shows weaker posterior ankle strength. **Conclusion**: Poor right ankle ATE, proprioception, and overall strength. Recommend targeted right ankle strengthening/proprioception training. Safety precautions during transfers/ambulation.
