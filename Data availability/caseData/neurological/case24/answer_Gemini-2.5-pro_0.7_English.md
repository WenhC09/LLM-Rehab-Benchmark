### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### **Short-term goals (within 4-6 weeks):**

1.  **Mobility & Transfers:**
    *   Achieve independent transfers from bed to wheelchair using a sliding board.
    *   Achieve standing in parallel bars with minimal assistance for at least 2 minutes, maintaining balance.
    *   Improve lower limb muscle strength to a Manual Muscle Test (MMT) grade of at least 4/5 (Left) and 4+/5 (Right).
2.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):**
    *   Achieve independence in feeding and grooming (modified independence with setup).
    *   Perform upper body dressing with minimal assistance and lower body dressing with moderate assistance.
    *   Improve Barthel Index score from 30 to at least 50.
3.  **Cognitive Function:**
    *   Independently use external memory aids (e.g., daily planner, smartphone reminders) to recall therapy schedules and daily tasks with >80% accuracy.
    *   Improve performance on selective attention tasks, reducing error rate by 50%.
4.  **Balance & Coordination:**
    *   Improve sitting balance to allow for reaching outside the base of support without loss of balance.
    *   Improve right ankle proprioception as measured by a decrease in tracking error on balance platform assessment.
5.  **Health & Safety Management:**
    *   Patient and family will be able to verbalize and demonstrate understanding of fall prevention strategies, skin integrity checks for numb areas, and signs/symptoms of hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia.
    *   Stabilize nutritional status and achieve a weight gain of 2-4 kg.

#### **Long-term goals (within 3-6 months):**

1.  **Ambulation:**
    *   Achieve independent ambulation indoors for at least 15 meters, potentially with a walker or cane.
    *   Achieve Holden Functional Ambulation Classification Level 3 or higher.
2.  **ADL Independence:**
    *   Achieve modified independence in all basic ADLs (bathing, dressing, toileting, transfers).
    *   Achieve a Barthel Index score of >85.
3.  **Cognitive & Social Function:**
    *   Integrate compensatory memory strategies into daily routines to manage personal appointments and medication schedules.
    *   Participate in simple community-based activities with supervision or assistance.
4.  **Physical Fitness:**
    *   Improve cardiovascular endurance to tolerate 20 minutes of continuous low-intensity exercise.
    *   Regain muscle mass with limb circumference measurements approaching pre-illness baseline.

### 2. Treatment Methods

#### **A. Physical Therapy (PT)**

1.  **Muscle Strengthening:**
    *   **Lower Limbs:** Progressive resistance training focusing on quadriceps, gluteals, hamstrings, and ankle dorsiflexors/plantarflexors. Start with active-assisted and active range of motion exercises, progressing to resistance bands and light weights as tolerated.
    *   **Core:** Mat-based exercises including bridging, pelvic tilts, and trunk rotation to improve core stability essential for balance and transfers.
2.  **Balance and Coordination Training:**
    *   **Sitting Balance:** Seated exercises on a therapy ball or edge of mat, involving reaching for objects in multiple planes to challenge trunk control.
    *   **Standing Balance:** Begin in parallel bars, progressing from static standing to weight shifting, tandem stance, and mini-squats. Incorporate visual feedback using mirrors.
    *   **Proprioception:** Targeted training for the right ankle using wobble boards (initially with support), foam surfaces, and single-leg stance attempts in the parallel bars.
    *   **Ataxia Management:** Emphasize slow, controlled movements. Use visual cues (e.g., targets on the floor) and proprioceptive input (e.g., light weighting of limbs if helpful) to improve motor control.
3.  **Functional Mobility Training:**
    *   **Transfer Training:** Intensive, repetitive practice of sit-to-stand, bed-to-chair, and chair-to-toilet transfers. Initially with maximal assistance and sliding board, progressing towards less assistance and no equipment.
    *   **Pre-gait and Gait Training:** Begin in parallel bars focusing on proper weight shift, step initiation, and heel-strike. Progress to using a standard walker when standing balance and strength improve.
4.  **Endurance Training:**
    *   Utilize an arm ergometer or recumbent stepper, starting with short intervals (5-10 minutes) and progressing duration and resistance based on tolerance and fatigue levels (monitoring FSS).

#### **B. Occupational Therapy (OT)**

1.  **Cognitive Rehabilitation:**
    *   **Memory:** Focus on compensatory strategy training. Intensive training in the use of a daily planner, digital calendars/alarms, and checklists for ADLs and medication. Employ errorless learning principles.
    *   **Executive Function & Attention:** Computer-based and functional tasks to improve sustained/selective attention, planning, and problem-solving (e.g., planning a simple meal, managing a mock budget).
2.  **ADL Retraining:**
    *   Break down complex tasks (dressing, bathing) into manageable steps.
    *   Introduce and train in the use of adaptive equipment: long-handled shoe horn, sock aid, shower chair, grab bars.
    *   Implement energy conservation and work simplification techniques to manage fatigue.
3.  **Upper Limb and Fine Motor Training:**
    *   Activities to improve left-hand coordination and dexterity (e.g., therapeutic putty, pegboards, writing practice).
    *   Sensory re-education for the left palm, using different textures and temperatures to stimulate sensory pathways.
4.  **Visual Perceptual Training:**
    *   Provide strategies to compensate for extraocular muscle palsy, such as scanning the environment by turning the head, and ensuring tasks are performed in well-lit, uncluttered spaces.

#### **C. Medical and Nutritional Management**

1.  **Nutritional Support:**
    *   Dietitian consultation is mandatory for a high-calorie, high-protein diet to reverse malnutrition and support muscle synthesis.
    *   Strict adherence to B-vitamin supplementation, especially high-dose thiamine, as per primary team's orders.
    *   Diet plan must be coordinated with the diabetes management plan to ensure stable blood glucose levels. Regular blood glucose monitoring before and after therapy sessions.
2.  **Medical Monitoring:**
    *   Continue prescribed antiepileptic and hypoglycemic medications.
    *   Monitor for anemia and electrolyte status.
    *   Regularly assess for skin breakdown, especially on lower limbs and buttocks, due to impaired sensation and mobility.

#### **D. Patient and Family Education**

1.  **Disease Process:** Educate the patient and family on Wernicke's Encephalopathy, emphasizing that cognitive recovery (especially memory) is often slower and less complete than motor recovery.
2.  **Safety:** Comprehensive training on fall prevention, home modification recommendations, and emergency procedures for seizures or severe hypoglycemia.
3.  **Therapeutic Alliance:** Involve the patient in goal setting to foster motivation. Provide regular, honest feedback on progress.
4.  **Psychosocial Support:** Monitor for signs of depression or anxiety. Provide supportive counseling and connect the patient and family with psychological services or support groups as needed.
