# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (within 4 weeks)
- Improve lower limb muscle strength by at least 1 MMT grade, especially left lower limb (target: L 4/5, R 5/5).
- Achieve independent sitting balance and progress to supported standing with assistive devices.
- Reduce lower limb hypoesthesia and improve proprioception, particularly at right ankle.
- Enhance performance in basic ADLs: improve Barthel Index from 30 to ≥50.
- Improve cognitive function: MoCA score increase by ≥3 points, with focus on attention shifting and delayed recall.
- Establish safe transfer techniques with minimal assistance.
- Reduce fatigue severity score by ≥10% through pacing and conditioning.

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months)
- Achieve independent ambulation on level surfaces with or without assistive device (Holden ≥ Level 3).
- Regain ability to perform most ADLs independently (Barthel Index ≥85).
- Restore near-normal proprioception and balance to enable safe community mobility.
- Improve cognitive function to pre-morbid levels or compensate effectively for memory/executive deficits.
- Achieve full participation in social and occupational activities within physical limits.
- Maintain seizure control and stable metabolic/nutritional status.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 Physical Therapy (PT)
- **Strengthening**:
  - Progressive resistance training for lower limbs, starting with isometric and isotonic exercises in supine/sitting, progressing to closed kinetic chain in standing.
  - Emphasis on left quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals, and ankle dorsiflexors/plantarflexors.
- **Balance & Proprioception**:
  - Static and dynamic sitting balance training → supported standing balance.
  - Proprioceptive training for right ankle using balance boards, tilt boards, and ankle joint position reproduction tasks under therapist supervision.
  - Gradual integration of visual feedback reduction to enhance somatosensory reliance.
- **Gait Training**:
  - Initiate with parallel bars, progressing to walker/crutches as tolerated.
  - Incorporate step training, weight shifting, and patterned walking drills.
- **Coordination**:
  - Targeted lower limb coordination exercises (heel-shin sliding in supine, stepping in marked patterns).
- **Endurance**:
  - Low-intensity cycling or recumbent stepper with gradual duration increase, monitoring fatigue.

### 2.2 Occupational Therapy (OT)
- **ADL Training**:
  - Task-specific practice for dressing, grooming, feeding, and toileting using adaptive techniques/devices.
  - Energy conservation and pacing strategies.
- **Upper Limb Function**:
  - Fine motor coordination exercises for left hand (pegboards, putty manipulation, writing practice).
- **Instrumental ADLs**:
  - Gradual reintroduction of complex tasks (meal preparation, light housework) as safety allows.

### 2.3 Cognitive Rehabilitation
- **Memory Training**:
  - Use of spaced retrieval, mnemonic devices, and external memory aids (notebooks, smartphone reminders).
- **Attention & Executive Function**:
  - Computer-based cognitive exercises targeting selective attention, divided attention, and task switching.
  - Real-life simulations for problem-solving and planning.
- **Orientation**:
  - Daily orientation sessions to time, place, and situation.

### 2.4 Speech & Oculomotor Therapy
- **Oculomotor Training**:
  - Eye movement exercises to improve bilateral abduction and reduce nystagmus (slow pursuit, saccadic training).
  - Visual scanning tasks to enhance visual attention.
- **Speech-Language**:
  - Language exercises focusing on areas of MoCA loss (naming, repetition) if residual deficits persist.

### 2.5 Sensory Re-education
- **Tactile Stimulation**:
  - Graded textures, temperature differentiation, and light touch/pressure discrimination for hypoesthetic limbs.
- **Proprioceptive Facilitation**:
  - Weight-bearing activities, joint compression techniques.

### 2.6 Nutrition & Medical Management
- **Nutritional Support**:
  - High-calorie, high-protein diet with vitamin supplementation (especially thiamine, B-complex).
  - Regular dietitian follow-up to address malnutrition and weight restoration.
- **Metabolic Control**:
  - Close monitoring of blood glucose; coordinate with endocrinology for diabetic management during rehab.
- **Seizure Prevention**:
  - Maintain antiepileptic medication; avoid overstimulation and fatigue triggers.

### 2.7 Psychological Support
- **Counseling**:
  - Individual sessions to address adjustment, coping strategies, and motivation.
- **Mood Monitoring**:
  - Regular assessment for depression/anxiety; involve psychiatry if scores increase.

### 2.8 Safety & Education
- **Fall Prevention**:
  - Educate patient and caregivers on safe transfer techniques, use of assistive devices, and environmental modifications.
- **Home Exercise Program**:
  - Structured, illustrated exercise plan for daily practice outside therapy sessions.

### 2.9 Frequency & Duration
- **Inpatient Setting**:
  - PT: 40–60 min, 5–6 days/week
  - OT: 30–45 min, 5 days/week
  - Cognitive rehab: 30 min, 5 days/week
  - Oculomotor/visual therapy: 15 min, 5 days/week
- **Progress Review**: Every 2 weeks to adjust goals and interventions.
