# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Improve lower limb strength to achieve the ability to stand with minimal assistance.
- Enhance cognitive function, aiming for a score of at least 24 on the MMSE.
- Increase independence in activities of daily living (ADLs), targeting a Barthel Index score of 50/100.
- Address nutritional needs to improve overall health and weight.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve independent ambulation with the use of assistive devices (e.g., walker) by the end of the rehabilitation program.
- Improve cognitive function to a level where the patient can manage daily tasks and participate in social activities.
- Attain a Barthel Index score of 80/100, indicating significant independence in ADLs.
- Stabilize blood glucose levels and manage diabetes effectively.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### Physical Rehabilitation:
- **Strength Training**: 
  - Focus on progressive resistance exercises for lower limbs (e.g., leg presses, squats) to improve muscle strength.
  - Incorporate functional training to practice standing and transferring with assistance.

- **Balance and Proprioception Training**: 
  - Use balance boards and stability exercises to enhance proprioception, particularly for the right ankle.
  - Implement gait training with a focus on weight shifting and stability.

- **Mobility Training**: 
  - Begin with assisted standing and progress to ambulation with a walker.
  - Utilize parallel bars for safety during initial walking attempts.

### Cognitive Rehabilitation:
- **Cognitive Exercises**: 
  - Engage in memory training activities (e.g., memory games, recall tasks) to improve memory function.
  - Implement attention and executive function tasks to enhance cognitive processing.

- **Occupational Therapy**: 
  - Focus on strategies to improve ADLs, including adaptive techniques for dressing, grooming, and feeding.
  - Provide education on energy conservation techniques to manage fatigue.

### Nutritional Support:
- **Dietary Consultation**: 
  - Develop a high-calorie, nutrient-dense meal plan to address malnutrition and promote weight gain.
  - Monitor blood glucose levels and adjust dietary intake accordingly to manage diabetes.

### Psychological Support:
- **Counseling and Support Groups**: 
  - Provide access to psychological support to address anxiety and depression.
  - Encourage participation in support groups for individuals with similar conditions.

### Monitoring and Evaluation:
- Regularly assess progress in strength, mobility, cognitive function, and ADLs.
- Adjust the rehabilitation plan based on the patient's response to treatment and any emerging needs.
