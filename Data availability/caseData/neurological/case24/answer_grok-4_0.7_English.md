# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4-8 weeks):
- Improve lower limb strength to MMT 4/5 bilaterally to enhance bed mobility and supported standing.
- Enhance sitting balance and trunk control to achieve independent transfers with minimal assistance.
- Improve cognitive function, targeting MoCA score ≥24/30, with focus on delayed recall and executive function.
- Reduce sensory deficits in lower limbs and left hand to improve functional sensation for ADL tasks.
- Increase Barthel Index score to ≥50/100, enabling partial independence in dressing, feeding, and grooming.
- Manage fatigue (FSS <30) and maintain stable mood (SDS <35, SAS <25) to support rehabilitation engagement.
- Prevent secondary complications (e.g., pressure ulcers, contractures) through positioning and passive ROM exercises.

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve independent ambulation with assistive devices (e.g., walker) and progress to Holden Functional Ambulation Classification Level 3.
- Restore full independence in basic ADLs (Barthel Index ≥80/100) for bathing, toileting, and transfers.
- Improve cognitive function to MMSE ≥28/30 and MoCA ≥26/30, with near-normal memory and executive function.
- Minimize sensory deficits to near-normal sensation in all limbs, supporting coordinated movements.
- Enhance social participation and quality of life (QoL score ≥90) through community reintegration and vocational planning.
- Maintain stable glycemic control and nutritional status to support physical and cognitive recovery.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy
- **Lower Limb Strengthening**: Progressive resistance exercises (e.g., leg presses, seated knee extensions) 3x/week, 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps at 50-60% 1RM, adjusted per MMT progress. Focus on right lower limb (MMT 4/5) and left (MMT 3/5) to address asymmetry.
- **Balance and Proprioception Training**: Right ankle-specific exercises (e.g., wobble board, resisted ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion) 3x/week, 15-20 min, guided by balance platform feedback (target ATE <50%). Seated balance tasks progressing to supported standing with parallel bars.
- **Gait Training**: Initiate with body-weight-supported treadmill training (30% unloading), 20 min/session, 3x/week, progressing to walker-assisted ambulation as strength improves.
- **Passive/Active-Assisted ROM**: Daily for all limbs to prevent contractures, 10-15 min, emphasizing hip, knee, and ankle joints.

### Occupational Therapy
- **ADL Training**: Task-specific training for dressing, feeding, and grooming, 30 min/day, 5x/week, using adaptive equipment (e.g.,-handled utensils) to reduce dependence. Progress to unsupported tasks as upper limb coordination improves.
- **Fine Motor Skills**: Left-hand dexterity exercises (e.g., pegboard, writing practice) to address residual palmar numbness and writing difficulty, 15-20 min/day, 4x/week.
- **Cognitive Retraining**: Memory and attention exercises (e.g., digit span tasks, cancellation tests) tailored to RBMT-2 deficits, 20 min/day, 5x/week. Use compensatory strategies (e.g., memory aids, structured routines) support delayed recall.

 Cognitive Rehabilitation
- **Structured Cognitive Therapy**: Computer-based training (e.g., Lumosity or similar) targeting visuospatial, executive, and memory deficits, 30 min/day, 4x/week. Include real-world tasks (e.g., planning daily schedules) to improve functional cognition.
- **Attention Training**: Graded tasks for sustained and selective attention (e.g., digit cancellation Stroop tasks), 15-20 min/day, 4x/week, progressing in complexity based on test performance.
- **Group Therapy**: Weekly 1-hour sessions for social interaction and problem-solving to address mild disorientation and executive dysfunction.

### Speech and Language Therapy
- **Oculomotor Training**: Exercises horizontal nystagmus and bilateral abduction limitation (e.g., tracking moving objects, saccadic eye movements), 10-15 min/day, 5x/week, guided by a neuro-optometrist.
- **Cognitive-Communication Support**: Address mild memory decline with structured conversation tasks and repetition exercises, 15 min/day, 3x/week.

### Nutritional and Medical Management
- **Nutritional Support**: Consult dietitian for high-protein, high-calorie diet (2000-2500 kcal/day) to address malnutrition and 30 kg weight loss. Include thiamine supplementation (100 mg/day IV or oral) to prevent Wernicke’s recurrence.
- **Diabetes Management**: Coordinate with endocrinologist for glycemic control (target HbA1c <7%) using hypoglycemic agents and regular glucose monitoring.
- **Epilepsy Management**: Continue antiepileptic therapy (e.g., levetiracetam) as prescribed, with regular neurology follow-up to monitor seizure control and EEG.
- **Anemia and Electrolyte Correction**: Iron supplementation and electrolyte monitoring (weekly labs) to stabilize hemoglobin and prevent imbalances.

### Psychosocial Support
- **Psychological Counseling**: Weekly 30-min sessions to address mild depression (SDS 39) and support emotional adjustment to functional limitations.
- **Family Education**: Train caregivers on safe transfer techniques and home modifications (e.g., grab bars, wheelchair accessibility) to support ADL independence.
- **Vocational Planning**: Begin discussions with occupational therapist for return-to-work strategies, focusing on cognitive and physical capacity, starting at 6 weeks.

### Monitoring and Progression
- **Weekly Assessments**: Re-evaluate MMT, Barthel Index, and MoCA every 2 weeks to adjust exercise intensity and cognitive tasks.
- **Safety Precautions**: Use transfer belts and supervision during ambulation attempts to prevent falls, given poor right ankle proprioception and balance platform results.
- **Interdisciplinary Team Meetings**: Biweekly reviews with neurologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and dietitian to ensure coordinated care.

### Home Exercise Program
- **Daily Regimen**: 10 min of seated leg lifts, 5 min of ankle circles, and 10 min of memory games (e.g., matching cards) to maintain progress between sessions.
- **Caregiver Support**: Provide written instructions for passive ROM and positioning to prevent secondary complications at home.
