# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan for Bilateral Knee Osteoarthritis

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4-8 weeks):
- Reduce bilateral knee pain at rest to VAS ≤ 3/10.
- Improve knee range of motion (ROM) to 0°–130° bilaterally.
- Enhance knee extension strength to grade 4/5 bilaterally.
- Improve standing balance to grade IV (normal
- Increase Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score for stair climbing and toileting to 8/10.
- Reduce anxiety related to pain and mobility limitations.

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve pain-free or minimal pain (VAS ≤ 1/10) during daily activities, including stair climbing and squatting.
- Restore full knee ROM (0°–135°) bilaterally.
- Maintain knee extension strength at grade 5/5 bilaterally.
- Resume regular swimming and leisure activities without restrictions.
- Achieve full independence in activities of daily living (MBI score 100/100).
- Promote psychological well-being with no anxiety related to mobility.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Pain Management
- **Physical Modalities**:
  - **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)**: Apply TENS to bilateral knees, 20 minutes/session, 3 times/week for 4 weeks to reduce pain (VAS target ≤ 3/10).
  - **Therapeutic Ultrasound**: Administer pulsed ultrasound (1 MHz, 0.5–1 W/cm²) to medial knee joint lines, 10 minutes/session, 3 times/week for 4 weeks to reduce inflammation and pain.
  - **Hot Packs**: Apply moist heat to bilateral knees, 15 minutes/session before exercises, 5 times/week to relax muscles and improve joint mobility.
- **Pharmacological Support** (in coordination with referring physician):
  - Continue oral ibuprofen (400 mg as needed, max 3 times/day) for pain relief, with monitoring for gastrointestinal side effects.
  - Consider intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections (if recommended by orthopedist) to lubricate joints and reduce pain.

### Therapeutic Exercise
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4)**:
  - **Isometric Quadriceps Strengthening**: Perform quadriceps sets (10 seconds hold, 10 repetitions, 3 sets/day) to improve knee extension strength without joint loading.
  - **Gentle ROM Exercises**: Active-assisted knee flexion/extension in supine position, 10 repetitions, 2 sets/day, within pain-free range (target 0°–120°).
  - **Ankle Pumps**: 20 repetitions, 3 sets/day to improve circulation and prevent stiffness.
  - **Seated Straight Leg Raises**: 10 repetitions, 3 sets/day to strengthen quadriceps and reduce knee stress.
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8)**:
  - **Progressive Resistance Training**: Introduce low-resistance elastic band exercises for quadriceps and hamstrings (10 repetitions, 3 sets/day, 3 times/week) to enhance strength to grade 4/5.
  - **Partial Weight-Bearing Exercises**: Mini-squats (0°–30° knee flexion) with support, 10 repetitions, 2 sets/day, to improve functional mobility.
  - **Balance Training**: Single-leg stance with hand support, 30 seconds/side, 3 sets/day, to improve grade III standing balance to grade IV.
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 9–24)**:
  - **Functional Training**: Step-ups (low step, 15 cm) with handrail support, 10 repetitions, 3 sets/day, 3 times/week, to improve stair climbing (MBI target 8/10).
  - **Closed Kinetic Chain Exercises**: Wall sits (30° knee flexion, 20 seconds hold, 10 repetitions, 2 sets/day) to enhance knee stability.
  - **Aquatic Therapy**: Resume swimming (30 minutes/session, 3 times/week) to promote low-impact aerobic conditioning and joint mobility (target full ROM 0°–135°).

### Manual Therapy
- **Joint Mobilization**: Grade I–II Maitland mobilizations to bilateral patellofemoral and tibiofemoral joints, 5 minutes/session, 2 times/week for 4 weeks, to improve ROM and reduce pain.
- **Soft Tissue Massage**: Apply gentle massage to quadriceps and hamstrings, 10 minutes/session, 2 times/week for 4 weeks, to reduce muscle tension and improve flexibility.

### Patient Education and Lifestyle Modification
- **Pain Management Education**: Teach pacing techniques to avoid overexertion during activities like stair climbing. Advise avoiding squatting and prolonged standing until pain decreases.
- **Joint Protection Strategies**:
  - Use knee braces or sleeves during activities to provide support and reduce joint stress.
  - Recommend supportive footwear with cushioning to minimize impact during walking.
- **Home Exercise Program**: Provide written instructions and demonstrations for daily exercises, emphasizing consistency and proper technique.
- **Environmental Modifications**: Advise using elevator when available to reduce stair climbing. Suggest handrails for home stairs to enhance safety.

### Psychological Support
- **Cognitive Behavioral Strategies**: Introduce relaxation techniques (deep breathing, 5 minutes/day) to manage anxiety related to pain and mobility limitations.
- **Counseling**: Refer to a psychologist or counselor for 1–2 sessions to address anxiety, focusing on coping strategies for chronic pain.

### Follow-Up and Monitoring
- **Weekly Assessments**: Monitor VAS pain scores, knee ROM, and muscle strength weekly for 8 weeks to adjust treatment intensity.
- **MBI Re-evaluation**: Reassess MBI at 4 and 8 weeks to track progress in stair climbing and toileting (target 8/10).
- **Long-Term Follow-Up**: Schedule follow-up at 3 and 6 months to evaluate pain, ROM, strength, and resumption of swimming/leisure activities.
- **Orthopedic Consultation**: Coordinate with orthopedist if pain or ROM does not improve after 8 weeks to consider further imaging or interventions.
