# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks)
- Reduce knee pain at rest and during activity by at least 2 points on the VAS scale.
- Improve knee joint range of motion to near functional levels (target ROM: extension 0°, flexion ≥125°) without aggravating symptoms.
- Enhance quadriceps and hip muscle strength to facilitate pain-free walking on level ground.
- Improve standing balance from Grade III to Grade II.
- Educate patient on joint protection, activity modification, and home exercise program.
- Reduce anxiety level through education and graded activity.

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months)
- Achieve independent and pain-minimized stair climbing (≥8/10 on activity scale).
- Maintain or improve MBI score to 100/100 with full participation in desired leisure activities (e.g., swimming).
- Establish sustainable self-management strategies for bilateral knee osteoarthritis, including weight management, exercise routine, and flare-up control.
- Maintain stable joint function, delay disease progression, and prevent secondary musculoskeletal complications.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 Physical Therapy
- **Pain management**
  - Local physiotherapy: Intermittent cryotherapy post-activity for pain relief; moist heat prior to exercise to reduce stiffness.
  - Low-frequency TENS (20–30 min, 1–2×/day) over knee joint for analgesia.
- **Range of motion training**
  - Gentle active-assisted and active ROM exercises (heel slides, seated knee flexion/extension) within pain-free range, 2–3 sets/day.
- **Muscle strengthening**
  - Isometric quadriceps contractions (quadriceps setting) and straight leg raises, progressing to closed-chain exercises (mini-squats ≤30°) as tolerated.
  - Hip abductors and extensors strengthening to improve lower limb alignment.
- **Balance training**
  - Standing weight shift, tandem stance, and single-leg stance with support as needed, progressing from stable to unstable surfaces.

### 2.2 Occupational Therapy
- Functional task training to improve stair climbing technique: step-to pattern, use of handrails.
- Education on activity pacing, joint protection strategies, and avoidance of high-impact activities (running, jumping).
- Home environment modification advice to reduce strain on knees (e.g., minimize stair use during elevator outage).

### 2.3 Hydrotherapy
- Utilize patient’s preference for swimming: 
  - Aquatic exercises in chest-deep warm water to reduce joint load while performing walking, gentle squats, and leg lifts.
  - Swimming styles avoiding excessive knee stress (prefer backstroke or freestyle over breaststroke).

### 2.4 Patient Education & Self-Management
- Disease education: nature of osteoarthritis, importance of regular low-impact exercise, weight control (if relevant).
- Pain flare-up management: rest, ice/heat, temporary activity adjustment.
- Home exercise program: daily 20–30 min of strengthening/stretching, 3–4×/week low-impact aerobic activity.

### 2.5 Psychological Support
- Counseling or supportive conversation to address anxiety related to pain and functional limitation.
- Incorporate relaxation techniques (deep breathing, mindfulness) into daily routine.

### 2.6 Medical Coordination
- Coordinate with physician for optimal pharmacologic pain control (e.g., NSAIDs as needed, topical agents).
- Monitor for changes in symptoms or adverse effects of medications.

### 2.7 Follow-up & Evaluation
- Reassess pain (VAS), ROM, muscle strength, balance, and MBI every 2–4 weeks.
- Adjust intensity and type of exercises according to progress and tolerance.
- Long-term follow-up every 3–6 months to reinforce self-management and modify program as needed.
