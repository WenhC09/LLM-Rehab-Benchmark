# Patient Medical Record

## I. Clinical Summary

**Patient**: Male, 61 years old.

**Chief Complaint**: Right knee pain for over 5 years, left knee pain for over 2 years, aggravated for over 1 month.

**Present Illness**: Over 5 years ago, the patient developed right knee pain after prolonged walking during travel, characterized by a distending sensation within the joint without stabbing pain or locking. Symptoms worsened during stair climbing, long-distance walking, and squatting but alleviated with rest and oral ibuprofen. Since then, right knee pain recurred intermittently, relieved by rest and aggravated by walking. Over 2 years ago, left knee pain developed without obvious cause, similarly relieved by rest and ibuprofen. Pain recurred irregularly without systematic treatment. Over 1 month ago, frequent stair climbing due to elevator malfunction exacerbated bilateral knee pain with increased intensity and duration, limiting stair climbing and squatting. Local hospital X-ray revealed "osteophyte formation on bilateral intercondylar eminences and slight narrowing of medial joint spaces." Symptoms showed no significant improvement after acupuncture and medication (details unknown). Admitted to our hospital for further treatment with a diagnosis of "bilateral knee osteoarthritis." Since onset: Normal mental status, appetite, sleep, bowel/bladder function, and stable weight.

**Past History**: Previously healthy. Denies chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease). Denies surgical history, blood transfusion, or drug allergies.

**Personal History**: Born and resides in urban Chengdu. Regular exercise (â‰¥6 times/week, ~1 hour/session, mainly swimming). College-educated. Calm temperament. Financially stable. Resides on the 7th floor.

**Physical Examination**:  
Temp $37^{\circ}C$, HR 80 bpm, RR 20/min, BP 116/78 mmHg.  
General condition good, alert, fluent speech. No jaundice, petechiae, or ecchymosis on skin/mucosa. No palpable superficial lymphadenopathy. Clear lung sounds bilaterally, no rales. Heart borders normal, HR 80 bpm, regular rhythm, no murmurs. Abdomen soft, non-tender, no rebound tenderness. Liver/spleen non-palpable. No lower limb edema.

**Specialized Examination**:  
Bilateral knees: Mild swelling, no obvious erythema, normal skin temperature. Local tenderness over medial aspects, more pronounced on left. Left knee: Pain on movement with significant aggravation and limited mobility. Right knee: Pain on movement with normal range. Normal muscle strength/tone in lower limbs. Positive patellar ballottement test. Normal bilateral tendon reflexes. No pathological reflexes elicited.

**Auxiliary Examinations**:  
Lab tests: Unremarkable.  
X-ray: Left knee - Osteophyte formation on intercondylar eminence, slight narrowing of medial joint space.  
X-ray: Right knee - Osteophyte formation on intercondylar eminence, slight narrowing of medial joint space.

**Clinical Diagnosis**: Bilateral Knee Osteoarthritis.

## II. Rehabilitation Assessment

**1. Structure Assessment**  
Bilateral knee osteophyte formation on intercondylar eminences with slight medial joint space narrowing, K-L grade 2.  
*   **Imaging**: X-ray shows osteophyte formation on left intercondylar eminence and slight medial joint space narrowing.  
*   **Imaging**: X-ray shows osteophyte formation on right intercondylar eminence and slight medial joint space narrowing.  

**2. Activity Assessment**  
Modified Barthel Index (MBI): ADL score 90/100. Stair climbing: 5/10, Toileting: 5/10, other items full score.  

**3. Participation Assessment**  
Retired, no occupational impact. College-educated with regular lifestyle. Frequent physical exercise (prefers swimming). Significant limitation in leisure/entertainment since illness onset.  

**4. Environmental & Personal Factors**  
(1) Urban residence with convenient shopping access. Resides on 7th floor with elevator; outdoor activities restricted during elevator malfunction.  
(2) College-educated with calm temperament. Good compliance and cooperation.  

**5. Functional Diagnosis**  
(1) Sensory impairment: Mild pain at rest (bilateral knees), severe pain during activity (VAS 8/10).  
(2) Motor impairment: Limited knee flexion/extension due to pain (ROM $0^{\circ} \sim 120^{\circ}$). Knee extension strength reduced bilaterally due to pain.  
(3) Balance impairment: Grade III standing balance with mild limitation.  
(4) Psychological dysfunction: Anxiety state.
