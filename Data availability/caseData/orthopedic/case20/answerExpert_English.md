### 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
**Short-term Goals:**
Alleviate pain in both knee joints, restore knee extensor muscle strength. Assist the patient in regaining standing balance function, eliminate anxiety related to the condition, and improve the ability to ascend/descend stairs and perform toileting activities.

**Long-term Goals:**
Fully restore the patient's ability to ascend/descend stairs and perform toileting activities, enabling re-engagement in pre-morbid leisure and recreational activities. Additionally, delay the progression of degenerative changes in both knee joints through rehabilitation interventions.

### 2. Treatment Methods:
The patient's rehabilitation treatment plan is a systematic and comprehensive strategy formulated based on a thorough assessment, including the following aspects:

**Physical Therapy:**
This component integrates physical agent modalities and therapeutic exercise.
*   **Physical Agent Modalities:** Aim to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and promote tissue repair. Specific modalities applied include:
    *   **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS):** Used to effectively alleviate knee joint pain and prevent disuse muscle atrophy due to pain.
    *   **Shortwave Diathermy:** Utilizes its thermal and non-thermal effects to improve local blood circulation, reduce inflammation and edema, and provide analgesia.
    *   **Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Therapy:** Used to relieve pain, release tissue adhesions, reduce inflammation and edema, and promote the repair of damaged tissues.
    *   **Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT):** Improves symptoms by elevating the pain threshold, reducing inflammation and swelling, and promoting tissue repair.
*   **Therapeutic Exercise:** Aims to enhance joint function and stability.
    *   **Aerobic Exercise:** Instruct the patient in low-load active isotonic exercises, such as swimming, stationary cycling, and limb linkage training, to safely improve cardiopulmonary function and endurance within the physiological range of motion.
    *   **Muscle Strength Training:** Focuses on isometric, isotonic, and isokinetic contraction training for the quadriceps femoris muscle to strengthen the muscles surrounding the knee joint.
    *   **Neuromuscular Training:** Improves the patient's control of joint movement through integrated sensorimotor control training.

**Occupational Therapy (OT):**
Aims to improve the patient's Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and social participation. Utilizes therapeutic and functional activities, such as targeted ADL training and balance function training, to enhance self-management skills and prevent disease progression and complications.

**Application of Rehabilitation Assistive Devices:**
Fitted the patient with knee braces for support and protection. Simultaneously recommended the use of elbow crutches when necessary, particularly during long-distance walking, to offload weight-bearing on the knee joints.

**Psychological Therapy:**
Primarily employed psychological counseling and supportive therapy to address the patient's anxiety related to the condition and help build confidence in rehabilitation.

**Rehabilitation Nursing and Education:**
Provided systematic education on knee osteoarthritis by a specialized rehabilitation nurse, with emphasis on teaching energy conservation techniques.

**Energy Conservation Techniques Instruction:**
As a critical method to prevent further joint damage, instructed by both the occupational therapist and rehabilitation nurse on the following principles:
*   Avoid maintaining the same weight-bearing posture for prolonged periods.
*   Learn and maintain correct body postures to reduce load on specific joints.
*   Maintain normal knee joint alignment during activities.
*   The intensity of all work or activities should adhere to the principle of not exacerbating or causing pain.

**Knee Joint Regenerative Rehabilitation:**
Administered intra-articular injection of Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP). This therapy aims to utilize PRP to modulate inflammatory mediators within the joint, promote differentiation of chondrocyte precursor cells into chondrocytes, and facilitate the repair and filling of cartilage matrix, thereby fundamentally improving joint condition.
