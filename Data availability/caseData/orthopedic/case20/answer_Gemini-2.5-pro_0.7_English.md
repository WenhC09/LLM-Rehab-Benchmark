# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4 weeks):
1.  **Pain Control:** Reduce activity-induced pain in both knees from VAS 8/10 to ≤ 4/10.
2.  **Inflammation and Swelling Reduction:** Resolve clinical effusion in both knees (negative ballottement test).
3.  **Improve Range of Motion (ROM):** Increase active knee flexion ROM from 120° to at least 130° bilaterally, without significant pain.
4.  **Muscle Activation:** Achieve pain-free isometric contraction of quadriceps and gluteal muscles.
5.  **Improve Balance:** Improve static standing balance from grade 3 to grade 4 (able to maintain single-leg stance for >5 seconds).
6.  **Patient Education:** Ensure the patient understands the diagnosis, joint protection principles, and the rationale for the home exercise program to alleviate anxiety.

### Long-term goals (within 3-6 months):
1.  **Pain Management:** Maintain pain at rest at VAS 0/10 and during daily activities (including stair climbing) at ≤ 2/10.
2.  **Restore Muscle Function:** Increase lower limb muscle strength, particularly quadriceps and hip abductors, to Grade 5/5 to provide dynamic joint stability.
3.  **Optimize Activities of Daily Living (ADL):** Achieve independence and pain-free performance in stair climbing and toileting, improving MBI score to 100/100.
4.  **Enhance Functional Endurance:** Be able to walk on level ground for at least 30 minutes continuously without significant pain or fatigue.
5.  **Return to Participation:** Safely and confidently resume recreational swimming at least 3 times per week.
6.  **Self-Management:** Empower the patient with a comprehensive home exercise program and strategies to independently manage symptoms and prevent future exacerbations.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Physical Therapy

1.  **Pain and Inflammation Management (Physiotherapy):**
    *   **Cryotherapy:** Apply cold packs to the anterior and medial aspects of both knees for 15-20 minutes, 2-3 times daily, especially after exercise, to control pain and swelling.
    *   **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS):** Apply to the most painful areas around the knees (primarily medial left knee) for 30 minutes, 1-2 times daily, for pain modulation.
    *   **Therapeutic Ultrasound:** Pulsed ultrasound over the tender medial joint lines to promote tissue healing and reduce inflammation.

2.  **Manual Therapy:**
    *   **Soft Tissue Mobilization:** Gentle massage to the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calf muscles to reduce tightness and improve flexibility.
    *   **Patellar Mobilization:** Medial, lateral, superior, and inferior glides to improve patellofemoral joint mobility and reduce anterior knee pain.
    *   **Joint Mobilization:** Gentle Grade I-II tibiofemoral traction and glides to inhibit pain and improve joint nutrition.

3.  **Therapeutic Exercise:**
    *   **Range of Motion Exercises:**
        *   Active and active-assisted heel slides in supine or seated positions.
        *   Stationary cycling with high seat height and no resistance, focusing on smooth motion.
    *   **Strengthening Exercises (Progressive):**
        *   **Initial Phase (Non-weight bearing):** Isometric quadriceps sets, gluteal sets, straight leg raises, and short-arc quad exercises to activate muscles without joint stress.
        *   **Progressive Phase (Closed-chain & Resistance):** As pain allows, progress to:
            *   Mini-squats (0-45° flexion), leg press (limited ROM).
            *   Hip abduction, adduction, and extension exercises (e.g., side-lying leg raises, bridges) to improve pelvic and knee stability.
            *   Seated leg extensions with light resistance.
    *   **Stretching Program:** Gentle, prolonged stretching (30-second holds) for hamstrings, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius-soleus complex.

4.  **Balance and Proprioception Training:**
    *   Static balance training: Progress from double-leg stance to tandem and single-leg stance on a firm surface.
    *   Dynamic balance training: Weight shifting exercises, controlled lunges.

5.  **Aquatic Therapy:**
    *   Strongly recommended given the patient's interest in swimming.
    *   Utilize water's buoyancy to perform walking, gentle jogging, squats, and ROM exercises with minimal joint impact.
    *   Focus on freestyle or backstroke swimming, avoiding the whip kick of breaststroke which can stress the medial knee.

### B. Patient Education

1.  **Disease Education:** Explain the nature of osteoarthritis as a "wear-and-tear" condition manageable with exercise and lifestyle changes. Address patient's anxiety by focusing on the positive prognosis with active management.
2.  **Joint Protection Strategies:**
    *   Teach activity modification: Avoid high-impact activities, deep squats, and prolonged standing.
    *   Instruct on proper stair negotiation: "Up with the good, down with the bad" leg, using the handrail.
    *   Advise on pacing activities and incorporating rest periods.
3.  **Home Exercise Program (HEP):** Provide a detailed, written, and illustrated program of the exercises listed above. Emphasize the importance of consistency over intensity, especially initially.

### C. Assistive Devices and Environmental Modification

1.  **Footwear:** Advise on wearing supportive, well-cushioned shoes to attenuate ground reaction forces.
2.  **Cane:** Recommend the use of a single-point cane, held in the right hand, to offload the more symptomatic left knee during community ambulation or when experiencing flare-ups.
3.  **Knee Support:** A simple neoprene sleeve may be beneficial for compression and proprioceptive feedback, providing a sense of security. An offloader brace is not indicated at this stage.
