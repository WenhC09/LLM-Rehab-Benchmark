# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan for Bilateral Knee Osteoarthritis

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
**Short-term goals (4-6 weeks):**
- Reduce resting knee pain to VAS ≤3/10 and activity-related pain to VAS ≤5/10
- Improve bilateral knee ROM to 0°-135° flexion
- Increase quadriceps strength by 1 MMT grade bilaterally
- Achieve independent pain-free toileting and ascend/descend 7 stairs with single rail support
- Reduce anxiety through coping strategies education

**Long-term goals (12+ weeks):**
- Maintain pain ≤2/10 during ADLs and recreational swimming
- Restore full functional ROM (0°-140°) without motion pain
- Normalize quadriceps strength (5/5 MMT)
- Resume pre-morbid exercise frequency (6x/week swimming)
- Develop sustainable joint protection habits

## 2. Treatment Methods
**A. Pain Management**
1. *Cryotherapy*: 15-min ice packs post-activity (BID)
2. *Electrotherapy*: TENS for pain modulation (20 min/session, QD)
3. *Pharmacotherapy Coordination*: NSAID timing optimization around activities
4. *Activity Pacing Education*: 30-min activity intervals with seated rests

**B. Therapeutic Exercise**
1. *Quadriceps Activation*: 
   - Isometric quad sets (10s hold × 15 reps, TID)
   - SLR with ankle weight (1lb start, 3×10 reps, BID)
2. *ROM Training*:
   - Heel slides (supine, 3×15 reps, BID)
   - Prone hangs (gravity-assisted extension, 5 min BID)
3. *Aquatic Therapy*:
   - Water walking (buoyancy-assisted, 20 min alternate days)
   - Terminal knee extension against water resistance

**C. Functional Training**
1. *Stair Negotiation*: 
   - Step training (4-inch block) with proper biomechanics ("up with good, down with bad")
   - Eccentric descent control drills
2. *Sit-Stand Transfers*: 
   - Chair rise practice (height adjustment from 50→40cm)
   - Toileting adaptation strategies (raised seat trial)

**D. Balance Training**
- Tandem stance (30s × 5 reps)
- Single-leg stance (progression from 10→30s)
- Foam surface balance (eyes open→closed)

**E. Psychosocial Intervention**
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques for pain-anxiety cycle
- Activity diaries to document pain-contingent pacing
- Relaxation training (diaphragmatic breathing)

**F. Environmental Modification**
- Temporary stair rail installation recommendation
- Home exercise program integration with daily routines (e.g., heel slides during TV time)

**G. Education**
1. *Joint Protection*: 
   - Avoid squatting/kneeling
   - Swimming stroke modification (avoid whip-kick)
2. *Load Management*: 
   - 30-min daily walking limit with trekking poles
   - Elevator outage contingency plan

**Progression Criteria:** 
- Advance exercises when pain ≤3/10 during activity 
- Re-assess MBI stair/toileting scores biweekly

*Based on structural evidence of K-L grade 2 OA, significant activity-related pain, and functional limitations in stair negotiation/toileting. Plan prioritizes quadriceps strengthening (key biomechanical deficit), pain-contingent pacing, and task-specific training. Aquatic therapy leverages patient's exercise preference while reducing joint loading. Environmental adaptations address specific barrier (7th floor residence).*
