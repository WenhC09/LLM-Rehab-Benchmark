# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Reduce bilateral knee pain to a VAS score of 4/10 or lower within 4 weeks.
- Improve range of motion (ROM) in both knees to 0째-130째 within 4 weeks.
- Enhance knee extensor strength to at least 3/5 bilaterally within 4 weeks.
- Increase modified Barthel Index (MBI) score for stair climbing and toileting to 7/10 within 4 weeks.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve pain-free ambulation and stair climbing within 3 months.
- Restore full range of motion (ROM) in both knees (0째-140째) within 3 months.
- Improve knee extensor strength to 4/5 bilaterally within 3 months.
- Enhance overall functional independence and participation in leisure activities within 3 months.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### A. Pain Management:
- **Modalities**: Apply ice packs for 15-20 minutes post-exercise to reduce inflammation and pain.
- **Medication**: Continue oral Ibuprofen as needed for pain control, monitoring for side effects.

### B. Physical Therapy:
- **Therapeutic Exercises**:
  - **Range of Motion (ROM) Exercises**: Gentle passive and active-assisted ROM exercises for both knees, focusing on flexion and extension.
  - **Strengthening Exercises**: 
    - Isometric quadriceps exercises (e.g., straight leg raises) to improve knee extensor strength.
    - Resistance band exercises for knee flexors and extensors.
  - **Balance Training**: Incorporate standing balance exercises (e.g., single-leg stands) to improve stability.

### C. Functional Training:
- **Gait Training**: Practice walking with a focus on proper mechanics and pain management.
- **Stair Climbing Training**: Gradual exposure to stair climbing with assistance as needed, focusing on proper technique.

### D. Education:
- **Patient Education**: Provide information on knee osteoarthritis, self-management strategies, and the importance of maintaining an active lifestyle.
- **Home Exercise Program**: Develop a tailored home exercise program to encourage continued progress outside of therapy sessions.

### E. Psychological Support:
- **Counseling**: Offer support for anxiety management, possibly through referral to a psychologist or counselor if needed.
- **Mindfulness Techniques**: Introduce relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or guided imagery to help manage anxiety and pain perception.

### F. Follow-up:
- Schedule regular follow-up appointments every 2 weeks to assess progress, adjust the treatment plan as necessary, and ensure adherence to the rehabilitation program.
