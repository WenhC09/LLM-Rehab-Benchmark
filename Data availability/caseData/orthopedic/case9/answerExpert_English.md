# 1. Rehabilitation Goals

## Short-term Goals:
*   **Initial Phase (4-8 weeks postoperatively):**
    *   Protect the repaired Achilles tendon, control swelling and pain.
    *   Reduce adhesion of the surgical incision scar and prevent joint stiffness.
    *   Activate and strengthen the calf and proximal lower limb muscles to prevent muscle atrophy.
    *   Initiate partial weight-bearing and weight-shifting exercises to improve weight-bearing capacity of the affected limb.
    *   Gradually increase active and passive range of motion (ROM) of the ankle joint.

*   **Intermediate Phase (10-12 weeks postoperatively):**
    *   Further increase ankle joint ROM in all planes, striving for symmetry with the contralateral side.
    *   Strengthen leg muscle groups and enhance proprioception.
    *   Gradually normalize gait pattern, aiming for independent ambulation without the Achilles boot.

## Long-term Goals:
*   Complete functional restoration of the left Achilles tendon, regaining normal left ankle joint function including strength, ROM, and stability.
*   Resume pain-free activities of daily living (ADLs) and walking ability.
*   Final return to home, social activities, and work participation.

# 2. Treatment Methods

### **Initial Rehabilitation Phase (4-8 weeks postoperatively)**

*   **Physical Modalities:**
    *   **Swelling and Pain Control:** Utilize intermittent pneumatic compression to promote circulation, manual lymphatic drainage to reduce edema, combined with cryotherapy and magnet therapy for edema reduction and analgesia.
    *   **Kinesio Taping:** Apply "I" or fan-shaped Kinesio tape along the lymphatic drainage pathways around the ankle and calf to promote swelling reduction.
    *   **Paraffin Wax Therapy:** Apply paraffin wax therapy to the ankle joint and peritendinous area, utilizing its thermal effect to loosen soft tissue adhesions and soften the surgical scar.

*   **Manual Therapy:**
    *   **Scar Mobilization:** The therapist applies pressure with both thumbs to opposite ends of the surgical scar, gently stretching in opposing directions to reduce deep tissue adhesions.
    *   **Triceps Surae Relaxation and Activation:** Utilize massage, myofascial release, and other techniques to relax the tense gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, followed by gentle muscle activation exercises.
    *   **Passive Stretching:** With protection of the Achilles tendon, the therapist performs gentle passive stretching of the patient's ankle joint, focusing on the triceps surae and Achilles tendon to improve dorsiflexion ROM.

*   **Therapeutic Exercise:**
    *   **Proximal Lower Limb Muscle Strengthening:** Perform active range of motion (AROM) and resistance exercises for the hip and knee joints (e.g., straight leg raises) to maintain thigh muscle strength.
    *   **Ankle Joint Active Range of Motion (AROM) Exercises:** Guide the patient to perform active plantarflexion, inversion, and eversion of the ankle within a pain-free range.
    *   **Isometric and Isotonic Strength Training:** Perform isometric contractions (without joint movement) for the triceps surae and tibialis anterior muscles, gradually progressing to isotonic resistance training using elastic bands.
    *   **Active Stretching:** The patient uses tools like a stretching strap to perform active stretching of the posterior calf muscles to increase flexibility.
    *   **Weight-Shifting Training:** The patient stands on two body weight scales, learning to shift and distribute weight between the feet by observing numerical changes, preparing for weight-bearing ambulation.
    *   **Core Muscle Training:** Perform exercises such as supine bridging to enhance trunk stability, supporting lower limb functional recovery.
    *   **Proprioception Training:**
        *   **Vibration Input:** Use a Deep Muscle Stimulator (DMS) to apply vibratory stimulation to the calf and plantar muscles to activate neural receptors.
        *   **Position Sense Input:** The therapist provides manual stimulation to the patient's plantar surface to enhance perception of foot position.

### **Intermediate Rehabilitation Phase (10-12 weeks postoperatively)**

*   **Joint Range of Motion (ROM) Training:**
    *   **Active Exercise Training:** Encourage the patient to perform active dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, and eversion of the ankle through the maximal available range.
    *   **Passive Joint Mobilization:** The therapist performs specialized passive joint mobilizations (e.g., Maitland grades) on the talocrural (ankle), subtalar, and midfoot joints to restore accessory motions and further improve ROM.

*   **Lower Limb Muscle Strength and Flexibility Training:**
    *   **Posterior Calf Muscle Stretching:** Utilize positions like standing lunge stretches to specifically target the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles.
    *   **Triceps Surae Strengthening:** Perform standing bilateral and unilateral heel raises to enhance Achilles tendon function.
    *   **Tibialis Anterior Strengthening:** Perform ankle dorsiflexion exercises with elastic band resistance.
    *   **Quadriceps Stretching:** Actively pull the heel towards the buttocks in prone or standing positions to stretch the anterior thigh muscles.
    *   **Hip Flexor Stretching:** Perform kneeling lunge stretches to target the anterior hip musculature, improving pelvic alignment and gait.

*   **Functional Training:**
    *   **Balance Training:** Perform standing and single-leg stance exercises on unstable surfaces (e.g., balance pads, BOSU ball) to challenge and improve ankle stability and overall balance.
    *   **Weight-Bearing Training:** Gradually increase the duration and stability of single-leg stance weight-bearing on the affected side within a pain-free range.
    *   **Gait Training:** Conduct supervised ambulation training to correct abnormal gait patterns (e.g., limping), focusing on coordinated movement of the hip, knee, and ankle joints during gait, particularly the stance phase function of the affected limb.
