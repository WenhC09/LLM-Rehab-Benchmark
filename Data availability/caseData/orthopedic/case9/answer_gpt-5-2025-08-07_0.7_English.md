# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2–4 weeks)
1. Reduce left ankle and foot swelling by at least 2 cm (figure-of-eight measurement).
2. Decrease resting pain from VAS 5 to ≤3.
3. Improve passive dorsiflexion from -5° to neutral (0°) and plantarflexion to ≥35°.
4. Increase left calf muscle activation (AEMG) by ≥15% compared to baseline.
5. Improve Berg Balance Scale standing balance from level 2 to level 3.
6. Progress ambulation from Holden FAC 2 to FAC 3 (with single-point cane on level surfaces).
7. Achieve Modified Barthel Index score ≥75 through improved transfers and basic mobility.

### Long-term goals (8–12 weeks)
1. Achieve near-symmetrical ankle ROM compared to the right side: dorsiflexion ≥10°, plantarflexion ≥40°, inversion/eversion ≥10°.
2. Restore left calf muscle strength to ≥85% of right side (AEMG and functional testing).
3. Ambulate independently without assistive device (Holden FAC ≥5) on level surfaces and stairs.
4. Eliminate significant gait asymmetry (<3% difference in limb weight-bearing).
5. Regain full independence in ADLs (Modified Barthel Index ≥95).
6. Resume pre-injury participation in work, social, and recreational activities without functional limitation.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Pain and Swelling Management
- **Cryotherapy**: Apply ice packs to the ankle 15–20 min, 2–3×/day, post-training.
- **Pneumatic compression therapy**: Intermittent sessions (30 min, 1–2×/day) to assist venous and lymphatic return.
- **Elevation**: Ankle elevated above heart level when resting.
- **Manual lymphatic drainage**: By therapist to promote fluid clearance.

### B. Scar and Soft Tissue Management
- Gentle scar mobilization after wound healing confirmed (avoid excessive tension on repair site).
- Soft tissue massage for surrounding structures to reduce adhesions.

### C. Range of Motion (ROM) Training
- **Passive and active-assisted ROM**: Focus on dorsiflexion, plantarflexion within pain-free limits; avoid forced stretching to protect repair.
- **Joint mobilization (Grade I–II)**: For talocrural and subtalar joints to reduce stiffness.
- **Progressive stretching**: Gastrocnemius–soleus complex stretching introduced gradually once tendon load tolerance improves.

### D. Muscle Strengthening
- **Isometric exercises**: Early-phase submaximal isometrics for plantarflexors and dorsiflexors in neutral ankle position.
- **Active exercises**: Gradually progress to active plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion without resistance.
- **Theraband resistance training**: Introduce at 4–6 weeks post-rehabilitation start when tendon healing and pain allow.
- **Closed kinetic chain exercises**: Partial weight-bearing heel raises, mini-squats as tolerance improves.

### E. Neuromuscular Re-education
- **sEMG biofeedback**: To enhance activation of gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis anterior.
- **Proprioceptive training**: Seated/standing weight shifts, progressing to single-leg stance on stable then unstable surfaces.

### F. Balance Training
- **Static balance**: Double-leg stance progressing to tandem and single-leg stance on firm and foam surfaces.
- **Dynamic balance**: Step training, reaching tasks, weight shift with visual and vestibular challenges.

### G. Gait Training
- **Assistive device progression**: From cane with AFO to cane without AFO, then unaided as stability and strength improve.
- **Treadmill walking**: With partial body-weight support initially, focusing on symmetrical step length and stance time.
- **Overground gait drills**: Emphasize heel-to-toe progression, proper push-off from forefoot.

### H. Functional and ADL Training
- Task-oriented practice: Transfers, stair negotiation (starting with step-to pattern), bathing and toilet transfers.
- Simulated community mobility tasks.

### I. Patient Education
- Importance of adherence to load progression guidelines to avoid re-injury.
- Home exercise program: Gentle ROM, swelling control, and prescribed strengthening.
- Footwear advice: Supportive shoes to accommodate orthosis transition.

### J. Adjunctive Modalities
- **Low-level laser therapy or ultrasound**: To promote tendon healing and reduce inflammation.
- **Electrical stimulation (NMES)**: For plantarflexor and dorsiflexor activation if voluntary contraction remains weak.

**Precautions**:  
- Avoid excessive dorsiflexion stretching in early rehabilitation to protect tendon repair integrity.  
- Progress loading gradually, monitoring for increased pain, swelling, or warmth around the tendon.  
- Coordinate with surgical team regarding healing status before advancing to high-load activities.
