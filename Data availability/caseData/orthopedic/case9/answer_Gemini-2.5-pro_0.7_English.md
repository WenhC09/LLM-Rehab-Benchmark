### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-term goals (to be achieved within 4 weeks):

1.  **Pain and Swelling Control:**
    *   Reduce resting and activity-related pain in the left ankle, with a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score of ≤ 3/10.
    *   Decrease left ankle swelling, aiming for a reduction in the figure-of-8 measurement by at least 2 cm (from 59.3 cm towards 57.3 cm or less).

2.  **Range of Motion (ROM) Improvement:**
    *   Achieve passive dorsiflexion of the left ankle to at least a neutral position (0°).
    *   Increase passive plantar flexion to at least 40°.
    *   Increase active plantar flexion to at least 30°.
    *   Initiate pain-free active and passive inversion/eversion movements.

3.  **Muscle Strength and Activation:**
    *   Improve voluntary activation of the left gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis anterior muscles, as demonstrated by an increase in Average Electromyography (AEMG) values during isometric contractions.
    *   Halt the progression of left calf muscle atrophy.

4.  **Functional Mobility:**
    *   Achieve symmetrical weight-bearing in static standing with the ankle-foot orthosis (AFO).
    *   Progress from wheelchair mobility to independent ambulation indoors for short distances (e.g., 50 meters) using a single cane or crutch, with improved gait mechanics (reduced trunk lean, improved push-off).
    *   Improve static balance to maintain single-leg stance on the left leg with support for >15 seconds.

5.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):**
    *   Achieve independence in transfers (bed-chair-toilet).
    *   Improve ADL score (Modified Barthel Index) to ≥ 80 points.

#### Long-term goals (to be achieved within 3-6 months):

1.  **Full Functional Recovery:**
    *   Achieve pain-free (VAS 0/10) full ROM in the left ankle, comparable to the right side.
    *   Restore left lower extremity muscle strength to >90% of the contralateral side.

2.  **Balance and Gait Normalization:**
    *   Achieve independent, stable walking on various surfaces (inclines, uneven ground) without assistive devices or an AFO.
    *   Demonstrate a symmetrical gait pattern on digitized analysis, with normal joint kinematics and weight distribution.
    *   Regain the ability to ascend and descend stairs with a reciprocal pattern.

3.  **Return to Pre-injury Activity Level:**
    *   Return to all pre-injury ADLs and social participation activities without limitation (Modified Barthel Index 100, ICF score < 10).
    *   Safely return to recreational activities, including the ability to perform activities requiring rapid directional changes and jumping.

### 2. Treatment Methods

The rehabilitation program will be comprehensive, progressive, and criterion-based, conducted 5 days per week.

#### Phase I: Pain/Swelling Control and Foundational Recovery (Weeks 1-4)

1.  **Physiotherapy (PT):**
    *   **Pain and Edema Management:**
        *   **Cryotherapy:** Application of a cryo-cuff or ice packs to the left ankle for 15 minutes, 2-3 times per session, especially after exercise.
        *   **Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD):** 20 minutes of gentle MLD for the left foot and lower leg to reduce swelling.
        *   **Interferential Current (IFC) Therapy:** 20 minutes for pain relief around the ankle joint.
        *   **Patient Education:** Instruct on frequent elevation of the left leg and use of compression garments when not in the AFO.
    *   **Range of Motion:**
        *   **Joint Mobilization:** Gentle Grade I-II talocrural and subtalar joint mobilizations to decrease pain and improve accessory motions.
        *   **Soft Tissue Mobilization:** Myofascial release for the calf muscles and gentle friction massage around the scar to prevent adhesions.
        *   **Stretching:** Therapist-assisted passive stretching for dorsiflexion (knee straight and bent) and plantar flexion, held for 30 seconds, 3-5 repetitions. All stretches must be slow and pain-free to protect the tendon repair.
    *   **Neuromuscular Re-education and Strengthening:**
        *   **sEMG Biofeedback:** 20 minutes of targeted training for the left tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and soleus to improve muscle activation during isometric contractions.
        *   **Isometric Exercises:** Sub-maximal isometric contractions for plantarflexors, dorsiflexors, invertors, and evertors (hold 10s, 10 reps, 3 sets).
        *   **Proximal Strengthening:** Exercises for hip and core muscles (e.g., glute bridges, clamshells, quadruped hip extension) to build a stable base for gait.
    *   **Balance and Gait Training:**
        *   **Weight-Bearing Progression:** Start with static bilateral stance in parallel bars, focusing on achieving symmetrical weight distribution using visual feedback (mirror or force plate). Progress from partial to full weight-bearing as tolerated.
        *   **Gait Training:** Begin walking in parallel bars, focusing on heel strike and weight transfer. Progress to using a single crutch. Utilize the digitized treadmill at low speeds with body-weight support if needed to provide real-time feedback on weight-bearing symmetry.

2.  **Occupational Therapy (OT):**
    *   **ADL Training:** Focus on safe techniques for bathing (using a shower chair), dressing, and toileting to improve the Barthel Index score.
    *   **Adaptive Equipment:** Prescription and training for any necessary equipment (e.g., long-handled shoe horn, sock aid).
    *   **Home Program:** Develop and instruct the patient on a detailed home exercise program focusing on elevation, icing, and gentle ROM exercises.

#### Phase II: Strength and Functional Restoration (Progression based on meeting Phase I goals)

1.  **Physiotherapy (PT):**
    *   **Range of Motion:**
        *   Progress to Grade III-IV joint mobilizations to increase capsular mobility.
        *   Introduce active-assisted and active ROM exercises through the full available range.
    *   **Strengthening:**
        *   **Isotonic Exercises:** Begin concentric exercises with resistance bands for PF, DF, inversion, and eversion.
        *   **Eccentric Loading:** Cautiously introduce eccentric calf strengthening (e.g., seated calf raises, progressing to double-leg standing, then negative-only single-leg calf raises) as this is critical for tendon remodeling.
        *   **Closed-Chain Exercises:** Progress to functional exercises like mini-squats, lunges, and step-ups, ensuring proper form.
    *   **Proprioception and Balance Training:**
        *   Progress to single-leg stance on the affected side.
        *   Introduce dynamic balance challenges: standing on unstable surfaces (foam pads, wobble boards), reaching outside the base of support, and tandem walking.
    *   **Gait Training:**
        *   Focus on weaning off the single assistive device.
        *   Continue treadmill training to normalize gait parameters (step length, stance time, push-off).
        *   Begin training on varied surfaces, inclines, and stair climbing (starting non-reciprocally).

2.  **Occupational Therapy (OT):**
    *   **Instrumental ADL (IADL) Simulation:** Begin activities related to home management and community mobility.
    *   **Vocational/Recreational Counseling:** Discuss patient's goals and develop a plan for a graded return to work and leisure activities.

#### Phase III: Return to High-Level Activity (Progression based on meeting Phase II goals)

1.  **Physiotherapy (PT):**
    *   **Advanced Strengthening:** Introduce plyometric exercises (e.g., hopping, skipping, box jumps) starting with bilateral and progressing to unilateral movements.
    *   **Sport-Specific Training:** Simulate activities relevant to the patient's goals, such as running, cutting, and jumping drills.
    *   **Endurance Training:** Incorporate cardiovascular exercise (e.g., stationary bike, elliptical) to improve overall fitness.

**Re-evaluation:**
Formal re-assessment of pain, swelling, ROM, strength (sEMG/dynamometry), balance, and gait will be conducted every 2-4 weeks to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. The plan will be progressed based on the patient's tolerance and achievement of specific functional criteria, not solely on time.
