# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (0-4 weeks):
- Reduce left ankle VAS pain score from 5 to ≤2
- Decrease left ankle swelling (Figure-of-8 measurement) from 59.3cm to ≤56cm
- Improve passive dorsiflexion from -5° to ≥0°
- Increase active plantarflexion from 20° to ≥25°
- Improve standing balance from level 2 to level 3 (moderate support)
- Increase Modified Barthel Index from 65 to ≥75

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- Restore functional ROM: Active dorsiflexion ≥10°, plantarflexion ≥35°
- Achieve bilateral calf symmetry (≤1cm circumference difference)
- Restore >80% plantarflexor strength (sEMG normalization)
- Independent community ambulation without assistive devices
- Modified Barthel Index ≥95 (independent ADL)
- ICF Mobility domain score improvement from 18 to ≤5

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Phase 1: Protection & Inflammation Control (Weeks 1-2)
- **Modalities**:
  - Cryotherapy: 15-min ice packs 4x/day post-exercise
  - Compression therapy: Figure-8 wrapping with progressive compression
  - Elevation protocol: 30-min sessions 5x/day
- **Manual Therapy**:
  - Gentle scar mobilization (Grade I-II)
  - Retrograde lymphatic drainage
  - Passive ROM within pain-free range (focus dorsiflexion to -5°)
- **Exercise**:
  - Toe towel curls/extension (3x15 reps)
  - Submaximal isometric plantarflexion (20% MVC)
  - Quadriceps/hamstring sets in AFO
  - Seated weight shifting drills

### Phase 2: Early Mobilization (Weeks 3-4)
- **Orthotic Management**:
  - Progressive AFO angle adjustment (5° increments/week)
  - Partial weight-bearing gait training (25-50% PWB)
- **Therapeutic Exercise**:
  - Active-assisted ROM using towel/strap
  - Aquatic therapy: Buoyancy-assisted dorsiflexion
  - Closed-chain mini-squats (0-30° knee flexion)
  - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to triceps surae (30Hz, 10s on/50s off)
- **Balance Training**:
  - Double-limb stance on firm surface (2-min bouts)
  - Weight-shifting drills in parallel bars

### Phase 3: Strength & Proprioception (Weeks 5-8)
- **Advanced Exercise**:
  - Eccentric loading program (3s lowering phase)
  - Resistance band exercises (plantarflexion/inversion/eversion)
  - Single-leg stance progression (eyes open→closed)
  - Treadmill gait training (0.8-1.2m/s, 0% incline)
- **Neuromuscular Re-education**:
  - Perturbation training on unstable surfaces
  - sEMG biofeedback for muscle recruitment
  - Stair negotiation training (step-to pattern)
- **Functional Training**:
  - Sit-to-stand transfers (progress to single-limb emphasis)
  - Obstacle course navigation

### Phase 4: Sport-Specific Training (Weeks 9-12+)
- **Plyometrics**:
  - Double-leg jumping → single-leg hopping
  - Lateral bounding drills
- **Advanced Gait**:
  - Inclined treadmill walking (5-10% grade)
  - Retro-walking for dorsiflexion
- **Proprioceptive Enhancement**:
  - Wobble board training
  - Reactive direction-change drills
- **Strength**:
  - Heel raise progression (double→single leg)
  - Isokinetic dynamometry (concentric/eccentric)

### Adjunctive Interventions
- **Pain Management**:
  - TENS (80-100Hz) for activity-related pain
  - Activity pacing education
- **Education**:
  - Home exercise program (HEP) with daily logs
  - Swelling management protocol
  - Footwear modification guidance
- **Outcome Measures**:
  - Biweekly: ROM, swelling, VAS
  - Monthly: sEMG, gait analysis, Barthel Index
  - Discharge: Functional Foot Index (FFI), calf circumference
