# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks):
- Reduce left ankle pain to VAS score ≤3.
- Decrease left ankle swelling (figure-of-eight measurement reduction by ≥1 cm).
- Increase active left ankle ROM: dorsiflexion to 0°, plantarflexion to ≥30°, inversion/eversion to ≥5°.
- Improve left lower limb muscle strength (soleus, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior) by ≥10% in AEMG values.
- Enhance static balance to Berg Balance Scale Level 3 (able to stand independently with supervision).
- Improve ambulation to Holden Functional Ambulation Classification Level 3 (ambulation with supervision, minimal assistance).
- Increase ADL score to ≥75 on Modified Barthel Index, improving transfers and ambulation independence.

### Long-term Goals (12–24 weeks):
- Achieve pain-free status (VAS score 0–1).
- Normalize left ankle girth (figure-of-eight measurement within 0.5 cm of right ankle).
- Restore left ankle active ROM to within 90% of right ankle (dorsiflexion ≥15°, plantarflexion ≥40°, inversion/eversion ≥10°).
- Restore left lower limb muscle strength to within 90% of right side AEMG values.
- Achieve Berg Balance Scale Level 4 (independent standing balance).
- Attain Holden Functional Ambulation Classification Level 5 (independent ambulation on level surfaces without assistive devices).
- Achieve ADL score ≥90 on Modified Barthel Index, enabling full independence in self-care.
- Improve ICF Activities and Participation Scale score to ≤30 points, with significant improvement in mobility and societal participation.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Pain and Swelling Management
- **Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD)**: 20-minute sessions, 3 times/week, reduce left ankle swelling by promoting lymphatic flow. Focus on gentle, rhythmic massage proximal to distal.
- **Cryotherapy**: Apply cold packs to the left ankle for 15 minutes, 2–3 times/day, to reduce pain and swelling. Ensure skin protection to prevent frostbite.
- **Compression Therapy**: Use elastic compression bandage (30–40 mmHg) during the day, removed at night, to control swelling. Monitor skin integrity.
- **Elevation**: Instruct patient to elevate left leg above heart level for 20–30 minutes, 3–4 times/day, during rest periods.

### Range of Motion (ROM) Restoration
- **Passive ROM Exercises**: Perform therapist-assisted passive stretching of the left ankle, focusing on dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, 10–15 repetitions, 2 sets/day, holding each stretch for 15–20 seconds. Avoid pain or excessive resistance.
- **Active-Assisted ROM Exercises**: Use a resistance band for dorsiflexion and plantarflexion exercises, 10–15 repetitions, 2 sets/day, progressing to active ROM as tolerated.
- **Joint Mobilization**: Grade I–II mobilizations of the talocrural and subtalar joints, 5 minutes/session, 3 times/week, to improve joint mobility and reduce stiffness.

### Muscle Strength Training
- **Isometric Exercises**: Initiate with isometric contractions of the soleus, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior (5-second holds, 10 repetitions, 2 sets/day) in neutral ankle position to minimize tendon stress.
- **Progressive Resistance Exercises**: Introduce low-resistance isotonic exercises using resistance bands for dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, and eversion, 10–12 repetitions, 2 sets/day, 3 times/week. Progress resistance as strength improves (monitor AEMG improvements).
- **Calf Muscle Activation**: Perform seated calf raises with partial weight-bearing, 10–15 repetitions, 2 sets/day, to address muscle atrophy. Progress to standing calf raises when balance improves.

### Balance and Proprioception Training
- **Static Balance Exercises**: Practice standing with bilateral support (e.g., parallel bars), progressing to single-leg stance on the right leg with left leg supported, 30 seconds, 3–5 repetitions, 3 times/week. Use AFO for stability.
- **Proprioceptive Training**: Use wobble board or foam pad for controlled weight-shifting exercises, 5 minutes/session, 3 times/week, with supervision to prevent falls.
- **Dynamic Balance**: Initiate weight-shifting tasks in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions, 10 repetitions/direction, 2 sets/day, progressing to tandem walking when Berg Balance Scale reaches Level 3.

### Gait and Ambulation Training
- **Gait Training with Assistive Devices**: Use a cane or walker for partial weight-bearing gait training on level surfaces, 10–15 minutes/day, focusing on equal weight distribution and reducing right-sided dominance. Monitor via instrumented treadmill feedback.
- **Treadmill Training**: Low-speed (0.5–1 km/h) treadmill walking with handrail support, 10–15 minutes, 3 times/week, to improve hip extension, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion during terminal stance.
- **Orthosis Adjustment**: Gradually reduce AFO dorsiflexion restriction as ROM and strength improve, transitioning to a lighter orthosis by week 8 if clinically appropriate.

### Functional and ADL Training
- **Transfer Training**: Practice bed-to-chair and chair-to-toilet transfers with minimal assistance, 5–10 repetitions/day, focusing on proper body mechanics and weight distribution.
- **ADL Skill Training**: Simulate daily tasks (e.g., bathing, dressing) with adaptive techniques, 15–20 minutes/day, to improve Modified Barthel Index scores for self-care.
- **Stair Training**: Begin with step-to pattern using handrails, 5–10 repetitions, 2 times/week, progressing to reciprocal stair climbing as balance and strength improve.

### Patient Education and Home Program
- **Education**: Provide instruction on Achilles tendon healing stages, importance of adhering to weight-bearing restrictions, and proper use of AFO and compression bandages. Emphasize avoiding high-impact activities for at least 12 weeks.
- **Home Exercise Program**: Provide a written plan for daily ROM, isometric, and elevation exercises, with clear instructions and illustrations. Include 10–15 minutes of cryotherapy and elevation twice daily.
- **Self-Monitoring**: Teach patient to monitor swelling (figure-of-eight measurement) and pain (VAS score) weekly, reporting changes to the rehabilitation team.

### Monitoring and Progression
- **Weekly Assessments**: Re-evaluate VAS score, figure-of-eight measurement, active/passive ROM, and AEMG every week to track progress and adjust intensity.
- **Biweekly Assessments**: Reassess Berg Balance Scale and Holden Functional Ambulation Classification to guide balance and gait training progression.
- **Follow-up Ultrasonography**: Schedule at 8 weeks to monitor Achilles tendon healing (tendon thickness, fiber continuity).
- **Team Collaboration**: Coordinate with physical therapist, occupational therapist, and orthopedic surgeon to ensure cohesive care and timely orthosis adjustments.

### Precautions
- Avoid aggressive stretching or high-resistance exercises to prevent re-rupture of the Achilles tendon.
- Monitor for signs of excessive swelling, skin breakdown, or infection at the surgical site.
- Limit weight-bearing to partial until cleared by the orthopedic surgeon (typically 6–8 weeks post-op).
- Ensure all exercises are performed within pain-free ranges to avoid aggravating joint stiffness or pain.
