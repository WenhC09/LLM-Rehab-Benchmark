# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Reduce left ankle swelling and pain (VAS score to decrease to 3 points or less within 4 weeks).
- Improve active range of motion (ROM) of the left ankle: aim for dorsiflexion to -5째 and plantar flexion to 30째 within 4 weeks.
- Increase muscle strength in the left distal lower extremity by 10% as measured by sEMG within 4 weeks.
- Enhance balance and stability to allow for independent standing for at least 30 seconds without support within 4 weeks.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve full active range of motion in the left ankle (dorsiflexion 0째, plantar flexion 40째) within 12 weeks.
- Restore muscle strength in the left calf to at least 80% of the right side as measured by sEMG within 12 weeks.
- Improve ambulation function to Holden Functional Ambulation Classification Level 4 (independent ambulation without assistive devices) within 12 weeks.
- Enhance ADL performance to a total score of 85 points or higher on the Modified Barthel Index within 12 weeks.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### A. Pain and Swelling Management:
- **Cryotherapy**: Apply ice packs to the left ankle for 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times daily to reduce swelling and pain.
- **Compression**: Use compression bandages or garments to manage swelling.
- **Elevation**: Encourage elevation of the left foot above heart level when resting.

### B. Range of Motion and Strengthening Exercises:
- **Passive Range of Motion (PROM) Exercises**: Initiate gentle PROM exercises for the left ankle to improve flexibility, focusing on all planes of motion.
- **Active Range of Motion (AROM) Exercises**: Gradually introduce AROM exercises as tolerated, emphasizing dorsiflexion and plantar flexion.
- **Strengthening Exercises**: Begin isometric strengthening exercises for the left ankle dorsiflexors, plantarflexors, and invertors/evertors, progressing to resistance bands as strength improves.

### C. Balance and Gait Training:
- **Balance Training**: Implement static balance exercises (e.g., single-leg stands) and dynamic balance exercises (e.g., weight shifting) to improve stability.
- **Gait Training**: Utilize a treadmill with body weight support to practice gait mechanics, focusing on proper weight distribution and reducing reliance on the right side.

### D. Functional Training:
- **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training**: Incorporate functional tasks such as transfers, toileting, and stair climbing into therapy sessions to enhance independence.
- **Assistive Device Training**: Educate the patient on proper use of the ankle-foot orthosis and cane to promote safe ambulation.

### E. Education and Self-Management:
- **Patient Education**: Provide information on the healing process, importance of adherence to rehabilitation exercises, and strategies for pain management.
- **Home Exercise Program**: Develop a tailored home exercise program to reinforce rehabilitation efforts and encourage compliance.

### F. Follow-Up and Reassessment:
- Schedule regular follow-up appointments every 2 weeks to monitor progress, adjust the treatment plan as necessary, and reassess pain, swelling, ROM, strength, balance, and functional abilities.
