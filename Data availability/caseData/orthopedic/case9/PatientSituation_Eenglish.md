# Case Information and Initial Assessment

## I. Case Summary

*   **Basic Information**: Male, 33 years old.
*   **Chief Complaint**: Left ankle swelling, pain, and limited mobility for over 1 month following trauma.
*   **Present Illness**: Approximately one month ago, the patient sustained a left foot injury after missing a step while descending stairs, experiencing immediate severe pain in the left heel with restricted movement and weak plantarflexion. He presented to our hospital's Emergency Surgery Department, underwent ankle radiographs and ultrasonography, and was admitted with a diagnosis of "Achilles tendon rupture." On October 13, 2023, he underwent "open Achilles tendon repair" under spinal anesthesia. The surgery was successful. Postoperatively, a "long leg cast (above-knee cast)" was applied for fixation. After 4 weeks, this was changed to an "adjustable ankle-foot orthosis (AFO)." No standardized functional training was performed. The patient currently presents with persistent left foot swelling, pain, and limited left ankle motion, prompting admission to our department for rehabilitation.

*   **Physical Examination**: Alert, conscious, in good spirits, wheelchair-bound upon entry.
*   **Specialized Examination**:
    *   Bilateral hip, knee, and right ankle range of motion (ROM) are normal.
    *   A surgical scar approximately $5\mathrm{cm}$ long is visible posterior to the left ankle joint. Healing is good, no significant exudate observed. Local skin temperature around the scar is slightly elevated.
    *   Light touch and pinprick sensation are symmetric around both ankles.
    *   Significantly restricted active ROM of the left ankle joint: Dorsiflexion $-10^{\circ}$, Plantarflexion $20^{\circ}$, Inversion $0^{\circ}$, Eversion $0^{\circ}$. Passive ROM: Dorsiflexion $-5^{\circ}$, Plantarflexion $30^{\circ}$, Inversion $0^{\circ}$, Eversion $0^{\circ}$.
    *   Significant swelling of the left foot and ankle. Figure-of-eight ankle measurement: Left $59.3\mathrm{cm}$, Right $54.9\mathrm{cm}$.
    *   Muscle atrophy visible in the left calf. Circumferential measurement at 10cm above the lateral malleolus: Left $33.3\mathrm{cm}$, Right $35.6\mathrm{cm}$.
    *   Muscle strength in the left distal lower limb is weaker than the right. Bilateral tendon reflexes are symmetric. Babinski sign negative.
    *   VAS Score: 5 points. ADL Score: 65 points.

*   **Auxiliary Examinations**:
    *   **Ankle Anteroposterior and Lateral Radiographs (Oct 12, 2023)**: Results show no significant fracture in the left ankle joint.
    *   **Ankle Ultrasonography (Oct 12, 2023)**: Results show swelling and thickening of the left Achilles tendon near its insertion point (approx. $8\mathrm{mm}$ thick). A complete discontinuity of the tendon is observed approximately $60\mathrm{mm}$ from the insertion point. The proximal (muscle belly) stump shows hyperechoic changes with thickened fiber texture. The gap between the two stumps is approx. $14\mathrm{mm}$, filled with hypoechoic material. No fluid is seen in the Achilles tendon bursa.

*   **Clinical Diagnosis**:
    1.  Status post left Achilles tendon rupture repair
    2.  Left ankle joint stiffness
    3.  Left ankle joint pain

*   **Functional Diagnosis**:
    1.  Left foot/ankle pain and swelling
    2.  Restricted left ankle joint ROM
    3.  Decreased muscle strength in the left distal lower limb
    4.  Balance dysfunction
    5.  Ambulation dysfunction
    6.  Activities of Daily Living (ADL) impairment
    7.  Restricted social participation capacity

## II. Post-admission Functional Assessments

1.  **Assessment of Left Foot/Ankle Pain and Swelling**
    *   VAS Score: 5 points.
    *   Figure-of-eight ankle measurement: Left $59.3\mathrm{cm}$, Right $54.9\mathrm{cm}$.
    *   Ankle Ultrasonography (Nov 21, 2023): Status post left Achilles tendon repair. Tendon swelling noted, significant swelling at the surgical repair site (approx. $16\mathrm{mm}$ thick). Fiber texture is thickened at this site with multiple short rod-like hyperechoic foci. Blood flow signals visible. No significant fluid around the Achilles tendon.
2.  **Assessment of Left Ankle Joint Range of Motion (ROM)**
    *   Active: Dorsiflexion $-10^{\circ}$, Plantarflexion $20^{\circ}$, Inversion $0^{\circ}$, Eversion $0^{\circ}$.
    *   Passive: Dorsiflexion $-5^{\circ}$, Plantarflexion $30^{\circ}$, Inversion $0^{\circ}$, Eversion $0^{\circ}$.
3.  **Initial Surface Electromyography (sEMG) Assessment of Ankle Dorsiflexor and Plantarflexor Muscle Groups**
    *   **Average Electromyography (AEMG) (Î¼V)**:
        *   Soleus: Left 74.95, Right 143.35.
        *   Gastrocnemius: Left 44.86, Right 128.27.
        *   Tibialis Anterior: Left 93.31, Right 108.53.
    *   **Analysis**: The median frequency (MF) and mean power frequency (MPF) of the left soleus, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior are lower than the right side, indicating poorer fatigue resistance in the left calf muscles. The AEMG values of the left soleus, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior are lower than the right side, indicating weaker muscle strength in the left calf.
4.  **Pulmonary Function Assessment**
    *   Pulmonary function testing: Breathing pattern is predominantly diaphragmatic. Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) is $109.61 \mathrm{~cmH}_{2}\mathrm{O}$, higher than the predicted normal value ($106 \mathrm{~cmH}_{2}\mathrm{O}$).
5.  **Balance Function Assessment**
    *   Currently wearing a foot orthosis on the left foot and requires a cane for standing and walking. Exhibits standing balance impairment. Berg Balance Scale score: Level 2 standing balance.
    *   Dynamic and static balance testing: Unable to complete dynamic balance tasks. Static balance shows center of gravity deviated to the right. Single-leg stability and balance on the left foot are significantly worse than the right.
6.  **Ambulation Function Assessment**
    *   Currently requires assistive devices for ambulation. Holden Functional Ambulation Classification: Level 2.
    *   Instrumented treadmill gait analysis: Right limb dominant weight-bearing ($8.3\%$ difference). Trunk deviation to the right greater than left. Insufficient hip extension, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion observed during terminal stance phase.
7.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assessment**
    *   Significant left foot/ankle pain and swelling, wearing an AFO. Modified Barthel Index score indicates difficulties with: Toilet use (5 points), Transfers (10 points), Ambulation (10 points), Stairs (0 points), and Bathing (0 points). Total score: 65 points. Basic self-care independence with mild functional impairment.
8.  **Social Participation Capacity Assessment**
    *   ICF Activities and Participation Scale score: 55 points (moderate impairment). Specific scores:
        *   Understanding and Communication: Normal (0 points).
        *   Mobility: Impaired (18 points).
        *   Self-Care: Impaired (11 points).
        *   Getting Along with People: Normal (0 points).
        *   Life Activities: Impaired (7 points).
        *   Participation in Society: Impaired (19 points).
