# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks)
- Relieve cervical pain and muscle tension (VAS ↓ by ≥2 points).
- Improve cervical mobility within pain-free range (extension ≥25°, flexion ≥45°).
- Enhance lower limb muscle strength to ≥4+/5 and improve walking stability.
- Reduce upper and lower limb paresthesia and improve fine motor control of hands.
- Educate patient on cervical protection, ergonomics, and self-management strategies.
- Maintain stable blood pressure during rehabilitation activities.

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months)
- Maximize neurological function recovery and prevent progression of myelopathy.
- Restore lower limb muscle strength to 5/5 and improve gait endurance (walk ≥500 m without significant fatigue or instability).
- Achieve near-normal cervical ROM without pain during ADLs.
- Improve JOA score by ≥20% from baseline.
- Enable independent performance of all ADLs and return to normal social participation.
- Prevent recurrence or aggravation through lifestyle modification and long-term cervical health maintenance.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 Physical Therapy
- **Cervical traction (mechanical or manual):** Low-load intermittent traction within tolerance to reduce disc pressure and relieve neural compression; avoid excessive force due to myelopathy risk.
- **Thermotherapy:** Local moist heat to cervical and shoulder muscles 20 min/day to reduce muscle spasm and improve circulation.
- **Electrotherapy:** TENS at cervical and upper back regions for analgesia (15–20 min/day).
- **Therapeutic exercises:**
  - Gentle cervical isometric exercises in neutral position; avoid extreme extension or rotation.
  - Active-assisted ROM exercises for cervical spine within pain-free range.
  - Upper limb coordination and dexterity training (e.g., pegboards, putty exercises).
  - Progressive lower limb strengthening: quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals; start with seated/lying positions, then progress to standing.
  - Balance and gait training: parallel bars → overground walking → obstacle negotiation.

### 2.2 Occupational Therapy
- ADL retraining to compensate for sensory deficits (e.g., using visual feedback for fine motor tasks).
- Ergonomic education: optimal desk height, monitor position, and micro-break strategies.
- Cervical orthosis education for short-term use during exacerbations or travel.

### 2.3 Sensory Re-education
- Tactile and proprioceptive stimulation for hands and lower limbs using graded textures and vibration.
- Safety training to prevent injury due to sensory loss.

### 2.4 Patient Education
- Pathophysiology of CSM and importance of avoiding high-risk neck movements.
- Home exercise program: daily gentle stretching, postural correction, and walking program.
- Fall prevention strategies given lower limb weakness and sensory changes.

### 2.5 Medical Management Support
- Continue antihypertensive therapy; monitor BP pre- and post-rehabilitation sessions.
- Analgesics or muscle relaxants as prescribed for pain control.
- Regular neurological reassessment to monitor for deterioration; educate patient to report any worsening symptoms promptly.

### 2.6 Psychological Support
- Counseling to address anxiety or fear of movement due to chronic symptoms.
- Encourage gradual resumption of social and recreational activities.

### 2.7 Follow-up and Reassessment
- Weekly assessment of pain, muscle strength, ROM, and gait.
- Monthly JOA score reassessment to track neurological recovery.
- Adjust therapy intensity and methods based on progress and symptom stability.
