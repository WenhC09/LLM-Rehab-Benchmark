# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (4 weeks)
- Reduce cervical VAS score from 4 to ≤2
- Improve bilateral lower limb strength from 4/5 to 4+/5
- Achieve independent bed-to-chair transfers
- Normalize cervical paraspinal muscle tension
- Prevent hypertension exacerbation during therapy (maintain BP <140/90 mmHg)
- Educate on spinal cord protection strategies

### Long-term goals (12 weeks)
- Restore independent community ambulation without gait aids
- Achieve JOA score improvement to ≥12/17
- Normalize light touch sensation in hands
- Establish sustainable home exercise program
- Enable safe return to modified desk work
- Prevent myelopathy progression

## 2. Treatment Methods
### Cervical Stabilization & Protection
- **Rigid cervical collar** during upright activities
- **Isometric neck exercises**: Chin tucks, scapular retractions (3 sets × 10 reps, 2x/day)
- **Postural re-education**: Mirror training for neutral cervical alignment
- **Ergonomic modification**: Adjust workstation to maintain neutral gaze (15° downward)

### Neuromotor Rehabilitation
- **Balance training**: Tandem standing → single-leg stance progression (5 min/session, 2x/day)
- **Gait training**: Parallel bars → quad cane progression with weight shift control
- **Lower limb strengthening**: Seated leg presses → mini-squats (60% 1RM, 3 sets × 12 reps)
- **Proprioceptive training**: Foam surface standing with supervision

### Pain & Sensory Management
- **Modalities**: Interferential current for paraspinal muscles (80 Hz, 15 min daily)
- **Manual therapy**: Grade I-II cervical mobilizations avoiding end-range rotation
- **Sensory re-education**: Textured object identification drills (10 min, 3x/day)
- **Thermotherapy**: Moist heat pre-exercise (20 min, <40°C)

### Cardiopulmonary Integration
- **Aerobic conditioning**: Recumbent cycling (RPE 11-13, 20 min/day)
- **BP response monitoring**: Pre/post-activity checks with auto-inflate cuff
- **Breathing exercises**: Diaphragmatic patterning for intra-abdominal pressure control

### Activity Modification
- **ADL training**: Energy conservation techniques during dressing/bathing
- **Sleep hygiene**: Cervical pillow trial with neutral alignment verification
- **Contraindication enforcement**: Strict avoidance of cervical manipulation, heavy lifting (>5kg), and high-impact activities

### Education & Self-Management
- **Myelopathy precaution signs** (bladder changes, grip deterioration)
- **Hypertension log** with exercise response documentation
- **Sedentary behavior breaks**: Timed standing/stretching every 30 minutes
- **Home exercise video library** for technique reinforcement
