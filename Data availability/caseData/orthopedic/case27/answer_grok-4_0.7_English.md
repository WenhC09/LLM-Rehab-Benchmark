# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks):- Reduce cervical pain (target score ≤2).
- Improve cervical range of motion (ROM) to near-normal extension (0°–35°) and flexion (0°–50°).
- Enhance lower limb strength to 5/5aterally.
- Improve sensory function in upper and lower limbs ( numbness and improve pinprick sensation).
- Enhance ability to basic activities of daily living (ADL) with minimal discomfort, such as dressing and grooming.

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
- Achieve sustained relief (VAS score 0–1).
- Restore full cervical ROM and maintain cervical stability.
- Normalize lower limb motor function and eliminate "walking on cotton" sensation.
- Restore normal sensory function in quadrilimbs.
- Improve social participation, enabling return to light work-related activities and hobbies (e.g., reading without discomfort).
- Prevent further progression of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) symptoms through lifestyle modifications.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Pain Management
- **Manual Therapy**: Gentle cervical mobilization (Grade I–II) by a trained physiotherapist to reduce paraspinal muscle tension and improve joint mobility. Avoid high-velocity manipulations due to spinal cord involvement. Frequency: 2–3 sessions/week for 4 weeks.
- **Modalities**:
  - Low-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to cervical paraspinal muscles for pain relief. Settings: 80–100 Hz, 20 minutes/session, 3 times/week for 4 weeks.
  - Intermittent cervical traction (10–15 kg, 15 minutes/session) to reduce disc pressure and alleviate nerve root irritation. Frequency: 3 times/week for 4 weeks.
- **Thermal Therapy**: Moist heat packs to cervical region for 15–20 minutes before therapy to relax muscles and improve local circulation. Frequency: Daily during therapy sessions.

### B. Motor Function Restoration
- **Lower Limb Strengthening**:
  - Isometric quadriceps and hamstring exercises (e.g., straight leg raises, seated leg presses with low resistance). Perform 3 sets of 10–12 repetitions, 3 times/week.
  - Progressive resistance training (start with body weight, progress to light resistance bands) for hip flexors/extensors and ankle dorsiflexors/plantarflexors to address 4/5 strength. Frequency: 3 times/week.
- **Balance and Coordination Training**:
  - Standing balance exercises (e.g., tandem stance, single-leg stance with support) to address "walking on cotton" sensation. Perform 3 sets of 30 seconds, 3 times/week.
  - Proprioceptive training (e.g., wobble board exercises under supervision) to enhance lower limb sensory feedback. Frequency: 2 times/week for 6 weeks.

### C. Sensory Retraining
- **Desensitization Techniques**: Tactile stimulation with graded textures (e.g., cotton, soft brush, textured fabrics) to hands and lower limbs to improve cutaneous sensation. Perform 10–15 minutes/day, 5 days/week.
- **Sensory Discrimination Training**: Pinprick and light touch exercises with therapist guidance to retrain sensory pathways. Frequency: 10 minutes/session, 3 times/week for 6 weeks.

### D. Cervical Mobility and Stability
- **Active ROM Exercises**: Gentle cervical flexion, extension, and lateral flexion within pain-free range. Perform 2 sets of 10 repetitions, 2 times/day.
- **Postural Training**: Education on proper neck and shoulder posture during sitting and reading. Use of ergonomic chair and desk adjustments to reduce forward head posture. Daily practice with therapist feedback 1 time/week.
- **Cervical Stabilization Exercises**: Deep neck flexor strengthening (e.g., chin tucks) to improve cervical lordosis and stability. Perform 3 sets of 10 repetitions, 3 times/day.

### E. Functional Training for ADL
- **Task-Specific Training**: Practice dressing, grooming, and light household tasks with adaptive techniques to minimize cervical strain. Frequency: 2 sessions/week with occupational therapist for 6 weeks.
- **Energy Conservation Techniques**: Education on pacing activities to avoid fatigue, especially during prolonged reading or desk work. Incorporate 5–10 minute breaks every 30 minutes of sedentary activity.

### F. Lifestyle and Home Exercise Program
- **Home Exercise Program**:
  - Daily cervical ROM and stabilization exercises as described above.
  - Lower limb strengthening and balance exercises (3 times/week).
  - Sensory retraining with home-based tactile stimulation (10 minutes/day).
- **Lifestyle Modifications**:
  - Avoid prolonged sedentary positions; use a low, firm pillow to maintain cervical alignment during sleep.
  - Encourage light aerobic activity (e.g., walking 15–20 minutes/day, 5 days/week) to improve general circulation and endurance, avoiding high-impact activities.
- **Hypertension Management**: Continue Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide as prescribed, with regular BP monitoring (target <140/90 mmHg). Coordinate with primary care physician to ensure stable BP during exercise.

### G. Monitoring and Follow-Up
- Weekly physiotherapy assessments to monitor VAS score, cervical ROM, and lower limb strength.
- Re-evaluate JOA score and sensory function at 4 weeks to adjust treatment intensity.
- Repeat cervical MRI in 3 months to assess spinal cord signal changes, in consultation with orthopedic team.
- Monthly follow-up with rehabilitation physician to review progress and modify plan as needed.

### Precautions
- Avoid activities that exacerbate symptoms (e.g., heavy lifting, prolonged neck flexion).
- Monitor for worsening neurological symptoms (e.g., increased weakness, bowel/bladder dysfunction); immediate orthopedic consultation if present.
- Ensure therapist supervision for all manual therapy and traction to prevent spinal cord irritation.
