# Medical Record Information

## I. Clinical Summary

**Patient:** Male, 53 years old.  

**Chief Complaint:** Neck pain with bilateral upper limb numbness for over 6 years, aggravated with lower limb weakness for over 2 months.  

**Present Illness:**  
The patient, an office worker with a long history of sedentary desk work (often sitting for half a day continuously), developed neck pain and bilateral hand numbness without obvious cause over 6 years ago. Symptoms worsened with fatigue or cold exposure and partially relieved with rest. Diagnosed with "cervical spondylosis" via cervical anteroposterior/lateral radiographs at an external hospital, he reported symptom improvement after acupuncture and tuina (Chinese therapeutic massage).  
Over 2 months ago, upper limb numbness aggravated without trauma or clear triggers, accompanied by bilateral lower limb weakness and a "walking on cotton" sensation. Symptoms showed no significant improvement after rest or local acupuncture/tuina therapy. Cervical MRI at our hospital revealed:  
- Disc herniation at C3/4 to C5/6 levels;  
- Left-posterior disc herniation at C6/7;  
- Abnormal intramedullary signal at C4/5 level, suggesting spinal cord injury with possible mild softening.  
Orthopedic consultation recommended surgery, but the patient declined and requested conservative rehabilitation. Admitted with "Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy (CSM)."  
During the course, the patient remained alert, enjoyed reading with limited outdoor activities, used a normal-height pillow, and maintained stable diet, sleep, bowel/bladder function, and weight.  

**Past Medical History:**  
Hypertension (highest BP 180/100 mmHg), currently controlled with Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Self-monitored BP remains stable.

## II. Pre-Rehabilitation Examination

### Physical Examination  
*   **Vital Signs:** Temp 36.6°C, HR 72 bpm, RR 19/min, BP 135/70 mmHg.  
*   **General Status:** Alert, fair mental state.  
*   **Cervical Examination:** Neck stiffness, loss of cervical lordosis, no scoliosis. Bilateral cervical paraspinal muscle tension and tenderness (+). Tenderness (+) over C3–7 spinous/inter-spinous processes and mild bilateral paravertebral tenderness (+).  
*   **Cervical ROM:** Mildly limited: Extension 0°–20°, Flexion 0°–40°. Normal bilateral rotation/lateral flexion.  
*   **Special Tests:**  
    - Bilateral Foraminal Compression Test (–)  
    - Bilateral Brachial Plexus Traction Test (+)  
    - Cervical Rotation Test (–)  
    - Neck Lift Test (–)  
    - Neck Compression Test (+)  
*   **Neurological Examination:**  
    *   **Reflexes:**  
        - Biceps reflexes: Normal  
        - Triceps reflexes: Brisk  
        - Knee reflexes: Hyperreflexic  
        - Hoffmann's sign (+), bilaterally  
        - Ankle clonus: Absent  
        - Babinski sign: Negative, bilaterally  
    *   **Muscle Strength & Tone:**  
        - Upper limbs: Normal strength/tone  
        - Lower limbs: Strength 4/5, Normal tone  
    *   **Sensation:**  
        - Reduced cutaneous sensation in both hands  
        - Decreased pinprick sensation below mid-anterior thigh bilaterally; light touch intact  

*   **Quantitative Assessments:**  
    - Cervical VAS Score: 4  
    - JOA Score (Japanese Orthopaedic Association Assessment Scale): 92  

### Imaging Findings  
Cervical MRI: Loss of cervical lordosis. Disc herniation at C3/4–C5/6; Left-posterior herniation at C6/7; Abnormal intramedullary signal at C4/5 level, suggesting spinal cord injury with mild softening.  

### Diagnosis  
*   **Clinical Diagnosis:**  
    1. Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy (CSM)  
    2. Hypertension Stage 3 (Very High Risk)  
*   **Functional Diagnosis:**  
    1. Lower limb motor dysfunction  
    2. Quadrilimb sensory dysfunction  
    3. Cervical pain  
    4. Impaired activities of daily living (ADL)  
    5. Decreased social participation capacity
