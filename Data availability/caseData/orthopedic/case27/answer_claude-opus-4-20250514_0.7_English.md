# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Reduce neck pain (Cervical Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score to 2 or below) within 4 weeks.
- Improve cervical range of motion (ROM) by 20% within 4 weeks.
- Enhance lower limb muscle strength to grade 5/5 in 6 weeks.
- Improve sensory function in both hands and lower limbs, aiming for normal light touch sensation within 6 weeks.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve a Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) Score of 12/17 or higher within 3 months.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### Physical Therapy:
- **Manual Therapy:** Gentle mobilization techniques to improve cervical ROM and reduce muscle tension.
- **Therapeutic Exercises:**

  - Lower limb strengthening exercises focusing on quadriceps and hamstrings to enhance muscle strength.
  - Balance and proprioception training to improve lower limb function.
  
### Pain Management:
- **Modalities:** Application of heat or cold therapy to reduce pain and inflammation.
- **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS):** To manage pain and improve sensory function.

### Neurological Rehabilitation:
- **Sensory Re-education:** Techniques to enhance sensory perception in the upper and lower limbs.
- **Functional Training:** Activities of daily living (ADL) training to improve independence and participation.

### Education and Lifestyle Modification:
- **Patient Education:** Information on posture correction, ergonomic adjustments at the workplace, and the importance of regular breaks during sedentary activities.
- **Hypertension Management:** Counseling on dietary modifications (low sodium diet), regular physical activity, and adherence to medication.
