# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan for Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

*   **Short-term Goals:**  
    Alleviate cervical pain symptoms, reduce limb numbness and lower limb weakness to improve activities of daily living (ADL) independence.
*   **Long-term Goals:**  
    Provide health education regarding cervical spondylosis, guide correction of poor lifestyle and work habits, enhance cervical stability, prevent symptom exacerbation or recurrence, and ultimately improve quality of life and social participation.

### 2. Treatment Methods

The patient's rehabilitation employs a comprehensive strategy as follows:

*   **General Treatment & Pharmacological Intervention:**
    *   **Cervical Immobilization:**  
        Cervical collar fixation initiated upon admission to protect the cervical spine and prevent secondary injury from improper movement.
    *   **Pharmacotherapy:**  
        Oral NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) to reduce inflammation and pain: Celecoxib capsules 0.2g once daily.  
        Concurrent neurotrophic medication: Mecobalamin tablets 0.5mg three times daily to promote neural function recovery.
    *   **Health Education & Monitoring:**  
        Intensify health education for the patient and family members. Instruct caregivers to provide close supervision to prevent falls due to lower limb weakness.

*   **Physical Modality Therapy:**  
    Administered once daily, targeting cervical pain:
    *   **Infrared Therapy:**  
        Apply infrared lamp (250-300W) to the cervical region. Lamp distance: 30-40 cm from skin surface, adjusted to produce comfortable warmth. Duration: 20 minutes per session.
    *   **Ultrashort Wave Therapy:**  
        Apply using the opposing electrode method to the cervical region at microthermal dosage. Duration: 15 minutes per session.
    *   **Medium Frequency Electrotherapy:**  
        Place electrodes parallel over the posterior cervical region. Intensity: Maximum tolerable dose. Duration: 20 minutes per session.

*   **Traditional Rehabilitation Therapy:**
    *   **Acupuncture Therapy:**  
        Target limb numbness. Administered once daily with needle retention for 20 minutes per session.
    *   **Tui Na (Chinese therapeutic massage):**  
        Apply gentle manual techniques to the cervicoscapular region to relax tense muscle groups and improve cervical range of motion.

*   **Exercise Therapy:**
    *   **Functional Training:**  
        Address lower limb muscle weakness and limb numbness through lower limb coordination training and motor control training to improve motor function.
    *   **Cervical Stabilization Training:**  
        Enhance cervical stability by strengthening cervical musculature to improve motor control, thereby facilitating recovery of lower limb motor function.

*   **Pre-discharge Health Education:**  
    Detailed discharge instructions to consolidate therapeutic effects and prevent deterioration:
    *   **Maintain Proper Posture:**  
        Emphasize correct sitting and sleeping postures during work and daily activities. Reduce prolonged forward head posture during desk work. Avoid using excessively high pillows. Correct habits like reading or using mobile phones while lying in bed or on a sofa.
    *   **Avoid High-Risk Movements:**  
        Avoid abrupt neck jerking motions. Ensure neck warmth to prevent cold exposure.
    *   **Travel Protection:**  
        Recommend wearing a cervical collar during transportation to prevent potential cervical injury in case of accidents.
    *   **Adherence to Rehabilitation Exercises:**  
        Instruct the patient to consistently perform isometric neck muscle strengthening exercises to increase paravertebral muscle strength and enhance intrinsic cervical stability.
