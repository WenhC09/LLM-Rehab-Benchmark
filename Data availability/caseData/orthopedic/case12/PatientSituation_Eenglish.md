# Patient Medical Record

## I. Medical Summary

**Patient:** Male, 15 years old.  

**Chief Complaint:** Restricted limb mobility with speech impairment for over 8 months following a traffic accident.  

**Present Illness:** Eight months ago, the patient was struck by a vehicle, resulting in immediate unconsciousness and unresponsiveness without active bleeding. Emergency cranial CT at a local hospital revealed intracranial hemorrhage. He underwent "intracranial burr hole drainage" followed by ICU management. Post-discharge while still comatose, the patient was admitted to our hospital on August 13 for comprehensive rehabilitation including arousal therapy, neurotrophic agents, hyperbaric oxygen, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and physical therapy. Consciousness resumed on February 19 with residual memory decline, dysarthria, and bilateral ankle stiffness with talipes equinovarus deformity. Current status: Able to lift upper limbs and grasp objects but unable to sit/stand/walk independently. Highly dependent for activities of daily living (ADL). Admitted for systematic rehabilitation under diagnosis of "Recovery phase of traumatic brain injury."  

**Past Medical History:** Secondary epilepsy, bilateral pulmonary infection, urinary tract infection. Currently on antiepileptic therapy with sodium valproate.  

**Physical Examination:**  
- Vital signs: Temp 36.3°C, Pulse 70/min, Resp 18/min, BP 111/66 mmHg  
- Cardiopulmonary/abdominal: Unremarkable  
- Neurological: Conscious with mixed aphasia, poorly cooperative.  
  - Symmetrical forehead wrinkles, no ptosis.  
  - Pupils: Bilateral isocoria (~4mm diameter), left pupillary light reflex sluggish, right prompt.  
  - Extraocular movements intact.  
  - Nasolabial folds grossly symmetric; deviation of mouth angle to right when showing teeth. Able to puff cheeks. Tongue protrusion to right. Uvula midline, normal gag reflex.  
- Musculoskeletal: No soft tissue swelling. Symmetric muscle atrophy in lower limbs.  
  - Sensory exam: Non-cooperative.  
  - Reflexes:  
    - Left biceps/triceps/brachioradialis ++  
    - Left patellar/achilles +++  
    - Left ankle clonus (+)  
  - Muscle strength:  
    - Upper limbs: 4+  
    - Lower limbs: 3+  
  - Muscle tone: Hypertonia in lower limbs.  
  - Pathological signs: Bilateral Babinski (+), no others elicited.  
  - Coordination: Unsteady finger-nose test.  

## II. Rehabilitation Assessment  

1.  **Manual Muscle Testing:**  
    - Upper limbs: 4+  
    - Ankle dorsiflexion (tibialis anterior): 3  
    - Plantarflexion (gastrocnemius): 3  
    - Plantarflexion (soleus): 3  
    - Inversion (tibialis posterior): 3  
    - Eversion (peroneus brevis/longus): 3  

2.  **Left Ankle Passive ROM:**  
    - Dorsiflexion: 0°–5°  
    - Plantarflexion: 0°–10°  
    - Inversion: 0°–5°  
    - Eversion: 0°–5°  
    *(Limited range)*  

3.  **Lower Limb Pain:** VAS 7/10.  

4.  **Modified Ashworth Scale:**  
    - Upper limbs: Flexor/extensor tone Grade 1  
    - Lower limbs: Tibialis anterior tone Grade 2; Gastrocnemius/soleus tone Grade 2  

5.  **Brunnstrom Stages:**  
    - Upper limb: Stage V  
    - Hand: Stage V  
    - Lower limb: Stage III  

6.  **Reflexes:**  
    - Left biceps/triceps/brachioradialis: ++  
    - Left patellar/achilles: +++  
    - Left ankle clonus: (+)  

7.  **Motor Function:** Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) score: 18.  

8.  **Speech Assessment:** Mixed aphasia.  

9.  **ADL:** Modified Barthel Index: 40.  

## III. Auxiliary Examinations  

- **Cranial CT (Aug 30, 2023):** Bilateral frontal lobe encephalomalacia; right frontal subdural effusion. No significant interval change.  
- **Bilateral Ankle DR (Aug 30, 2023):** Imaging confirms bilateral talipes equinovarus.  

## IV. Diagnosis and Current Status  

- **Clinical Diagnoses:**  
  1.  Severe traumatic brain injury (Recovery phase)  
  2.  Secondary bilateral talipes equinovarus post-brain injury  

- **Functional Diagnoses:**  
  Quadriparesis, speech impairment, central facial paralysis, balance dysfunction, pain, activity limitation.  

- **Current Status:**  
  Bilateral talipes equinovarus deformity. Deviation of mouth angle to right when showing teeth. Dysarthria with impaired conversational ability. Delayed responses. Able to puff cheeks. Tongue protrusion to right.
