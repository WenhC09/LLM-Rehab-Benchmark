# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Improve passive range of motion (PROM) in bilateral lower limbs, aiming for at least 10° in dorsiflexion and 15° in plantarflexion within 4 weeks.
- Reduce bilateral lower limb pain (VAS score) from 7 to 4 within 4 weeks.
- Enhance communication skills to facilitate simple yes/no responses within 6 weeks.
- Increase independence in basic activities of daily living (ADLs) as measured by the Modified Barthel Index, aiming for a score of 50 within 6 weeks.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve functional mobility, including the ability to sit independently and initiate standing with assistance within 3 months.
- Improve muscle strength in bilateral lower limbs to at least 4 grade in all muscle groups within 6 months.
- Attain a Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) score of 40 or higher within 6 months.
- Achieve improved speech clarity and the ability to engage in simple conversations within 6 months.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
- **Physical Therapy:**
  - Implement a structured program focusing on passive and active-assisted range of motion exercises for the lower limbs.
  - Utilize stretching techniques to address muscle stiffness and improve flexibility, particularly in the ankle joints.
  - Introduce strengthening exercises for the upper and lower limbs, progressing to weight-bearing activities as tolerated.
  - Incorporate balance training exercises to enhance stability and prevent falls.

- **Occupational Therapy:**
  - Provide training in adaptive techniques for activities of daily living (ADLs) to promote independence.
  - Use assistive devices as needed to facilitate participation in self-care tasks.

- **Speech Therapy:**
  - Conduct regular sessions focusing on speech clarity and language skills, utilizing techniques to improve articulation and reduce slurred speech.
  - Implement communication aids and strategies to enhance interaction and engagement.

- **Pain Management:**
  - Employ modalities such as heat, cold therapy, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to manage pain in the lower limbs.
  - Consider pharmacological interventions as needed, in consultation with the medical team.

- **Neurorehabilitation Techniques:**
  - Utilize neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to promote muscle activation and prevent atrophy in the lower limbs.
  - Explore the use of mirror therapy to enhance motor recovery and promote neuroplasticity.

- **Family Education and Support:**
  - Involve family members in the rehabilitation process to provide support and encouragement.
  - Educate the family on the nature of the patient's condition, rehabilitation goals, and ways to assist in therapy.

- **Regular Monitoring and Assessment:**
  - Schedule regular assessments to monitor progress towards rehabilitation goals and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.
  - Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team to ensure comprehensive care and address any emerging needs.
