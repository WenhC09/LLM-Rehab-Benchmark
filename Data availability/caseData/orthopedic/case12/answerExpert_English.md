# **1. Rehabilitation Goals:**
## **Short-term Goals:**
Through comprehensive rehabilitation therapy, improve bilateral ankle joint range of motion (ROM), correct talipes equinovarus deformity, alleviate lower limb pain, and initiate balance and coordination training.

## **Long-term Goals:**
*   Progressively enhance weight-bearing ambulation capacity, improve abnormal gait and body posture, strengthen proprioception and neuromuscular control, and prevent related complications.
*   The ultimate goal is to maximize the restoration of the patient's activities of daily living (ADL) independence and improve their level of social participation.

# **2. Treatment Methods:**
The rehabilitation plan for this case employs a phased, multidisciplinary comprehensive strategy, primarily targeting the patient's severe bilateral talipes equinovarus deformity and associated motor dysfunction.

## **Phase One: Non-surgical Comprehensive Rehabilitation**

The goals of this phase are to improve muscle strength, reduce muscle tone, and correct deformity. Specific interventions include:

*   **Resistive Exercise Therapy:** Target the affected lower limbs. The therapist applies resistance to the patient's dorsum of the foot, guiding thigh flexion, abduction, and internal rotation movements. Isometric contraction resistance training is performed at specific angles. When a dorsiflexion-eversion reaction is elicited, the patient is encouraged to actively complete the movement. Stretch stimulation is applied at the end of muscle contraction to reinforce active muscle contraction and movement control.
*   **Motor Relearning:** Utilize inclined surfaces for targeted training. The patient walks sideways on the incline with the affected leg positioned on the higher side to stretch the tight invertor muscle groups.
*   **Joint Mobilization and Stretching:** Manual release of tight peri-ankle soft tissues. Implement bilateral ankle Passive Range of Motion (PROM) exercises and systematic soft tissue stretching to improve joint ROM.
*   **Botulinum Toxin Type A Injection Therapy:** To alleviate severe muscle spasticity, local injections of Botulinum Toxin Type A were administered to hypertonic muscles bilaterally, including the tibialis posterior and flexor digitorum longus. However, in this case, this treatment yielded suboptimal response with no significant improvement in muscle tone.
*   **Physical Modalities:** Integrated application of various physical agents, including Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) to activate and strengthen weak antagonist muscles (e.g., tibialis anterior, peroneus longus and brevis), Biofeedback therapy to assist the patient in relearning muscle control, alongside Medium Frequency Therapy Device and Pneumatic Compression Device to relieve muscle tension and promote circulation.
*   **Orthotic Management:** Ankle Orthosis applied during non-training hours to maintain the ankle joint in a neutral functional position. Ankle-Foot Orthosis (AFO) worn during gait training to provide support and correct gait deviation.
*   **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Therapy:** Combined acupuncture and Tui Na (Chinese therapeutic massage). Acupuncture based on the principles of regulating yin and yang and dredging meridians. Electroacupuncture stimulation applied to points including Fuliu KI7, Yanglingquan GB34, Zusanli ST36, and Qiuxu GB40, utilizing intermittent wave stimulation to modulate muscle tone balance, inhibit spasticity, and excite antagonist muscles. Concurrent Tui Na techniques were employed to relieve muscle tension and pain and promote local blood circulation.

## **Phase Two: Surgical Correction and Postoperative Rehabilitation**

Due to limited efficacy of Phase One conservative treatment and the patient's strong desire for ambulation, the rehabilitation team collaborated with orthopedics to perform orthopedic foot and ankle reconstruction surgery. Postoperatively, the patient returned to the rehabilitation department for Phase Two rehabilitation, focusing on functional recovery. This ultimately enabled the patient to achieve ambulation with orthotic support.

The overall treatment outcome was significant. Assessment results indicated the patient's bilateral lower limb pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score decreased markedly from 7 pre-treatment to 1 post-treatment. The Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score for Activities of Daily Living (ADL) also improved from 40 to 70.
