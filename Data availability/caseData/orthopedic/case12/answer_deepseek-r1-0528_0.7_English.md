# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term Goals (4-6 weeks)
- Increase bilateral ankle dorsiflexion PROM to 0°–15°
- Reduce lower limb pain (VAS ≤4)
- Achieve independent sitting balance for 5 minutes
- Improve tibialis anterior strength to 3+ grade
- Establish basic functional communication (e.g., 10 essential phrases)
- Increase Modified Barthel Index to 55

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months)
- Achieve assisted standing with ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs)
- Restore ankle dorsiflexion PROM to functional range (0°–20°)
- Attain modified community ambulation (15m) with walker
- Improve ADL independence (Barthel ≥70)
- Develop conversational speech clarity (50% intelligibility)
- Reduce lower limb spasticity (Ashworth ≤1)

## 2. Treatment Methods
### A. Musculoskeletal Interventions
1. **Ankle Management**  
   - Serial casting (long-leg casts) with progressive dorsiflexion correction  
   - Daily sustained manual stretching (30 min/session, 2×/day)  
   - Dynamic splinting during non-weight-bearing periods  
   - Ultrasound therapy to gastrocnemius/soleus complex  

2. **Strength Training**  
   - Progressive resistance training: Tibialis anterior NMES + biofeedback  
   - Closed-chain exercises: Seated heel raises, mini-squats with support  
   - Isokinetic training for quadriceps/hamstrings (sub-maximal intensity)  

3. **Spasticity Management**  
   - Pharmacological: Botulinum toxin Type A (target: gastrocnemius/soleus)  
   - Modalities: Cryotherapy pre-stretching, vibration therapy  

### B. Mobility Training
- Sitting balance: Ball exercises with perturbation training  
- Standing frame protocol (progressive tilt table)  
- Partial weight-bearing gait training (LiteGait® system)  
- Pre-gait exercises: Weight shifting, step simulation  

### C. Speech Rehabilitation
- Melodic Intonation Therapy for expressive aphasia  
- Oral motor exercises: Tongue lateralization drills, resistance training  
- AAC introduction (picture-based system initially)  
- Conversational scripting for daily needs  

### D. Pain Management
- Graded motor imagery program  
- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)  
- Hydrotherapy (34°C pool) for active-assisted ROM  
- Relaxation training with guided imagery  

### E. ADL Adaptation
- Task-specific training: Dressing with adaptive equipment  
- Environmental control system assessment  
- Wheelchair-seated self-care simulation  
- Energy conservation techniques  

### F. Adjunctive Therapies
- Neuromodulation: Repetitive TMS (1Hz right frontal lobe)  
- Mirror therapy for lower limb motor control  
- Cognitive-linguistic dual-task training  

### G. Monitoring & Safety
- Weekly PROM/Ashworth reassessment  
- Seizure precautions during all therapies  
- Skin integrity checks with serial casting  
- Fall risk protocol during mobility training

*Implementation Notes*  
- Frequency: All active therapies 5×/week except hydrotherapy (3×)  
- Progression Criteria: ≥5° dorsiflexion gain or 1-point Ashworth reduction  
- Precautions: Monitor for autonomic dysreflexia during stretching; valproate levels checked biweekly  
- Team Coordination: Orthotics consult for custom AFOs at 10° dorsiflexion achievement
