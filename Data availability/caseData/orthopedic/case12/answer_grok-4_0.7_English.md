# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

###-term Goals (4–8 weeks):
- Improve lower limb muscle strength to at least 4/5 on manual muscle testing.
- Increase left ankle passive range of motion (ROM) for dorsiflexion and plantarflexion to 10°–15°.
- Reduce lower limb spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale) to Grade 1.
- Decrease lower limb pain (VAS) to 4/10 or lower.
- Enhance sitting balance to maintain posture for 5 minutes unsupported.
- Improve speech intelligibility for basic communication (e.g., single words or short phrases).
- Increase Modified Barthel Index (ADL) score to 50–60 for partial independence in self-care tasks.

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
- Achieve independent sitting and assisted standing/walking with aids (e.g., walker or ankle-foot orthoses).
- Restore ankle ROM to functional levels (dorsiflexion ≥15°, plantarflexion ≥20°) to support ambulation.
- Normalize muscle tone in lower limbs (Modified Ashworth Scale Grade 0–1).
- Improve Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) score to 30–40 for enhanced motor function.
- Achieve conversational speech with minimal dysarthria for effective communication.
- Attain Modified Barthel Index score ≥80 for near-independent ADL performance.
- Correct or manage talipes equinovarus deformity to facilitate weight-bearing and mobility.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy
- **Strength Training** (3–5 sessions/week, 45 min):
  - Progressive resistance exercises for lower limbs (e.g., seated leg press, resistance band exercises for ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion) to improve muscle strength (targeting tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, soleus).
  - Upper limb strengthening (e.g., hand weights, grip exercises) to maintain and enhance Stage V Brunnstrom function.
- **Stretching and ROM Exercises** (daily, 30 min):
  - Passive and active-assisted stretching for bilateral ankles to increase dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, and eversion ROM.
  - Focus on reducing talipes equinovarus deformity with prolonged low-load stretches (e.g., ankle splinting in neutral position for 20–30 min/day).
- **Spasticity Management** (daily):
  - Slow, sustained stretches for lower limb muscles (tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, soleus) to reduce hypertonia (Grade 2 Modified Ashworth Scale).
  - Consider serial casting or dynamic splinting for talipes equinovarus to maintain ankle alignment.
- **Balance and Coordination Training** (3 sessions/week, 30 min):
  - Seated balance exercises (e.g., weight shifting, reaching tasks) to improve trunk control and progress toward unsupported sitting.
  - Finger-nose and heel-shin coordination drills to address unsteady motor function (FMA score 18).
- **Gait Preparation** (2–3 sessions/week, 20 min):
  - Partial weight-bearing exercises using parallel bars or body-weight support systems to prepare for standing.
  - Use of bilateral ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) to correct talipes equinovarus and support ankle stability.

### Occupational Therapy
- **ADL Training** (3 sessions/week, 30 min):
  - Task-specific training for self-care (e.g., feeding, grooming) to improve Modified Barthel Index score.
  - Adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled tools, grab bars) to enhance independence in daily tasks.
- **Fine Motor Skills** (3 sessions/week, 20 min):
  - Hand dexterity exercises (e.g., pegboard tasks, object manipulation) to maintain Stage V hand function and improve grip strength.
- **Cognitive Training** (2 sessions/week, 20 min):
  - Memory and attention exercises (e.g., simple recall tasks, sequencing activities) to address residual memory decline and improve response time.

### Speech and Language Therapy
- **Speech Therapy for Mixed Aphasia** (4 sessions/week, 30 min):
  - Exercises to improve articulation and reduce dysarthria (e.g., oral motor exercises, phonation practice).
  - Language therapy focusing on word retrieval, sentence formation, and conversational skills.
  - Use of augmentative communication devices (e.g., picture boards) if needed for early communication support.
- **Facial Muscle Training** (3 sessions/week, 15 min):
  - Oro-facial exercises to address central facial paralysis and tongue deviation (e.g., cheek puffing, tongue movement drills).

### Pain Management
- **Pharmacological**:
  - Continue antiepileptic therapy (sodium valproate) for secondary epilepsy, monitoring for side effects.
  - Consider low-dose baclofen or tizanidine for spasticity-related pain (VAS 7/10), titrated based on response and tolerance.
  - Non-opioid analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen) for residual lower limb pain, as needed.
- **Non-Pharmacological** (daily):
  - Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) over lower limbs to reduce pain (VAS 7/10).
  - Heat therapy or cryotherapy as tolerated to alleviate muscle discomfort.

### Orthotic and Assistive Devices
- **Bilateral Ankle-Foot Orthoses (AFOs)**:
  - Custom-fitted AFOs to correct talipes equinovarus, maintain ankle alignment, and support weight-bearing during gait training.
- **Mobility Aids**:
  - Provide a wheelchair for mobility, transitioning to a walker as balance and strength improve.
- **Splinting**:
  - Night splints for ankles to maintain stretch and prevent contracture progression.

### Additional Interventions
- **Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy** (2 sessions/week, 60 min):
  - Continue to support neural recovery and reduce cerebral edema, based on prior use and traumatic brain injury recovery phase.
- **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)** (2 sessions/week, 20 min):
  - Continue low-frequency TMS to reduce spasticity in lower limbs and enhance motor cortex excitability.
- **Psychosocial Support** (1 session/week):
  - Counseling for patient and family to address emotional and psychological challenges of recovery.
  - Education on traumatic brain injury recovery to set realistic expectations and improve compliance.

### Monitoring and Follow-Up
- Reassess muscle strength, ROM, spasticity, and pain (VAS) biweekly to adjust therapy intensity.
- Repeat Fugl-Meyer Assessment and Modified Barthel Index every 4 weeks to track motor and ADL progress.
- Speech therapy progress evaluation every 4 weeks to adjust communication goals.
- Monitor for antiepileptic drug side effects and seizure activity; adjust sodium valproate as needed.
- Orthopedic consultation in 6–8 weeks to evaluate talipes equinovarus correction and consider surgical options (e.g., tendon release) if no improvement in ROM or deformity.
- Repeat cranial CT in 3 months to monitor encephalomalacia and subdural effusion.

This plan is tailored to the patient’s current recovery phase from severe traumatic brain injury, addressing quadriparesis, talipes equinovarus, mixed aphasia, and ADL limitations. Adjustments will be made based on ongoing assessments and clinical response.
