# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (4-6 weeks):
*   **Pain Management:** Reduce bilateral lower limb pain from VAS 7 to VAS < 4 to improve tolerance for therapeutic interventions.
*   **Contracture Management:** Increase passive ankle dorsiflexion to at least 0Â° (neutral) bilaterally to create a plantigrade foot position necessary for future standing.
*   **Spasticity Reduction:** Decrease muscle tone in bilateral lower limbs from Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) 2 to 1+ or less in the gastrocnemius/soleus complex.
*   **Motor Function:**
    *   Improve bed mobility to achieve independent rolling and bridging.
    *   Achieve independent static sitting balance on the edge of the bed for at least 5 minutes.
    *   Improve selective motor control of the lower limbs, progressing from Brunnstrom Stage III towards Stage IV.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):**
    *   Improve Modified Barthel Index (MBI) from 40 to 50.
    *   Actively participate in upper body dressing and grooming with minimal assistance.
*   **Communication:**
    *   Establish a reliable method for basic communication (e.g., consistent yes/no response, use of a communication board).
    *   Improve articulation of single words to be understood by family and staff.

### Long-term goals (6-12 months):
*   **Mobility:** Achieve safe transfers (e.g., bed to wheelchair) with minimal assistance. Progress towards standing in parallel bars with support and appropriate orthoses. Aim for limited household ambulation with an assistive device.
*   **Function:** Maximize independence in all ADLs, aiming for an MBI score > 75.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Prevent further joint deformities and maintain functional range of motion in all limbs.
*   **Communication:** Engage in simple, context-based conversations.
*   **Community Integration:** Facilitate a return to a modified educational or social environment, commensurate with cognitive and physical abilities.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Physical Therapy (PT)
*   **Pain & Spasticity Management:**
    *   **Stretching:** Implement a program of prolonged, low-load passive stretching for bilateral ankle plantarflexors and invertors, performed multiple times daily.
    *   **Serial Casting:** Initiate bilateral serial casting for the ankles to progressively correct the equinovarus deformities. Casts to be changed every 5-7 days to gradually increase dorsiflexion and eversion.
    *   **Physical Modalities:** Use pre-stretching thermal agents (e.g., moist heat packs) on lower limb musculature to decrease muscle viscosity and post-activity cryotherapy to reduce pain and inflammation.
    *   **Positioning:** Utilize positioning splints or multi-podus boots when the patient is at rest in bed to maintain gains in range of motion achieved during therapy.
*   **Neuromuscular Re-education & Strengthening:**
    *   **Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES):** Apply FES to the tibialis anterior and peroneal muscles during active-assisted dorsiflexion and eversion exercises to facilitate muscle activation and counteract spastic antagonists.
    *   **Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF):** Employ PNF techniques to improve motor control and strength in the lower limbs, focusing on breaking synergistic patterns.
    *   **Strengthening:** Focus on strengthening hip and knee extensors and abductors (MMT 3+) in preparation for weight-bearing. Upper limb strengthening will be incorporated into functional activities.
*   **Balance & Mobility Training:**
    *   **Bed Mobility:** Intensive training in rolling, scooting, and bridging.
    *   **Sitting Balance:** Progress from static to dynamic sitting balance on a mat table, incorporating reaching activities in all directions to challenge postural responses.
    *   **Upright Acclimation:** Use a tilt table to gradually acclimate the patient to an upright, weight-bearing position, monitoring vital signs closely. This will precede standing training.
    *   **Transfer Training:** Begin with transfer board training from bed to wheelchair once sitting balance is established.

### B. Occupational Therapy (OT)
*   **ADL Retraining:**
    *   Train the patient in self-care activities (grooming, feeding, upper body dressing) using techniques of energy conservation, task adaptation, and adaptive equipment as needed.
*   **Upper Limb & Fine Motor Function:**
    *   Although at Brunnstrom Stage V, focus on tasks requiring fine motor coordination, dexterity, and bimanual integration to improve functional use of the hands for ADLs.
*   **Cognitive & Perceptual Rehabilitation:**
    *   Integrate cognitive exercises (attention, memory, sequencing) into functional tasks to improve carryover.
*   **Splinting & Positioning:**
    *   Fabricate custom Ankle-Foot Orthoses (AFOs) once adequate passive range of motion is achieved through serial casting, to maintain foot position and provide stability for transfers and standing.
    *   Assess and ensure proper wheelchair seating and positioning to promote trunk stability, prevent pressure injuries, and optimize functional reach.

### C. Speech-Language Pathology (SLP)
*   **Aphasia Therapy:**
    *   **Comprehension:** Use drills with increasing complexity, from pointing to objects to following multi-step commands.
    *   **Expression:** Implement word-retrieval exercises, sentence completion tasks, and structured conversational practice.
    *   **Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC):** Develop and train the patient and family on a low-tech communication board (pictures, words) to ensure functional communication of immediate needs and reduce frustration.
*   **Dysarthria & Oral Motor Therapy:**
    *   Implement exercises to improve strength, range of motion, and coordination of the lips, tongue (targeting rightward deviation), and jaw to improve speech clarity.
    *   Address breath support for speech production.
*   **Dysphagia Management:**
    *   Conduct a formal clinical swallowing evaluation to assess safety and efficiency of swallowing, given the high risk associated with TBI. Modify diet consistency and recommend swallowing strategies as indicated.

### D. Medical Management
*   **Pharmacological Intervention for Spasticity:**
    *   **Focal Chemodenervation:** Administer Botulinum toxin injections into the spastic gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis posterior muscles bilaterally. This is a primary intervention to reduce focal tone, alleviate pain, and facilitate the effectiveness of serial casting and stretching.
    *   **Oral Medications:** Consider initiating a low dose of an oral antispasmodic agent (e.g., Baclofen or Tizanidine), monitoring closely for sedation or cognitive side effects which could impede rehabilitation participation.
*   **Pain Management:**
    *   In addition to spasticity management, prescribe neuropathic pain agents (e.g., Gabapentin) if a neuropathic component to the pain is suspected.
*   **General Medical Care:**
    *   Continue antiepileptic medication (Sodium Valproate) and monitor for seizure activity and drug levels.
    *   Implement a structured bowel and bladder program to prevent urinary tract infections and constipation.
    *   Maintain vigilant skin surveillance to prevent pressure ulcers.

### E. Patient and Family Education
*   Provide comprehensive education to the patient and family regarding the diagnosis, prognosis, and the rehabilitation plan.
*   Train the family on safe transfer techniques, proper positioning in bed/wheelchair, and the home exercise program (especially passive range of motion exercises).
*   Set realistic expectations for the pace and extent of recovery.
*   Provide counseling and connect the family with psychosocial support resources to address the emotional impact of such a severe injury.
