# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4–6 weeks)
- Improve passive and active range of motion (ROM) of bilateral ankles to reduce contracture progression.
- Reduce lower limb spasticity (Modified Ashworth ≥2) to improve comfort and facilitate functional training.
- Enhance lower limb muscle strength from MMT 3 to at least 3+/4−.
- Improve sitting balance and achieve independent static sitting for at least 10 minutes.
- Reduce lower limb pain (VAS 7 → ≤4).
- Initiate supported standing with assistive devices.
- Improve articulation and basic word expression in daily communication.
- Increase Modified Barthel Index from 40 to ≥55.

### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
- Achieve functional standing and ambulation with assistive devices (walker or crutches).
- Further reduce spasticity to Modified Ashworth ≤1+ in lower limbs.
- Increase lower limb muscle strength to at least MMT 4.
- Achieve dynamic sitting balance and independent transfers (bed ↔ chair).
- Walk at least 10 meters with minimal assistance.
- Improve speech to allow basic daily conversation with family.
- Increase Modified Barthel Index to ≥75, achieving partial independence in ADL.
- Prevent recurrence/aggravation of talipes equinovarus and maintain functional foot position.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 Physical Therapy (PT)
- **Positioning & Splinting:**
  - Use bilateral ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) or adjustable night splints to maintain neutral ankle position and prevent further contracture.
  - Apply proper limb positioning in bed to reduce spasticity (hips and knees slightly flexed, ankles at 90°).
- **Range of Motion Exercises:**
  - Daily passive and active-assisted ROM for bilateral ankles (dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, eversion) 2–3 sets/day.
  - Incorporate prolonged stretching (>30 seconds per stretch) for gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis posterior.
- **Spasticity Management:**
  - Inhibitory techniques: slow, rhythmic movements; weight-bearing in standing frame with knees extended and ankles in neutral.
  - Consider serial casting for ankles if ROM improvement plateaus.
- **Strengthening:**
  - Active-assisted then active exercises for lower limbs, focusing on tibialis anterior and peroneals to oppose equinovarus.
  - Progressive resistance training as tolerated.
- **Balance & Postural Control:**
  - Static sitting balance training with trunk control activities.
  - Progress to dynamic sitting and supported standing balance with parallel bars or standing frame.
- **Gait Training:**
  - Once standing balance improves, initiate supported stepping in parallel bars using appropriate orthoses.

### 2.2 Occupational Therapy (OT)
- **ADL Training:**
  - Gradual training in feeding, grooming, dressing with adaptive techniques and equipment.
  - Focus on safe transfer techniques.
- **Upper Limb Function:**
  - Fine motor coordination tasks, object manipulation, and strengthening to maintain functional use.
- **Cognitive Engagement:**
  - Simple problem-solving and memory training integrated into functional tasks.

### 2.3 Speech and Language Therapy (SLT)
- **Aphasia Rehabilitation:**
  - Structured language stimulation programs targeting comprehension and expression.
  - Use of visual aids, gesture training, and simplified language.
- **Articulation Training:**
  - Oral motor exercises for lips, tongue, and soft palate.
  - Practice of high-frequency words and short phrases.
- **Family Education:**
  - Teach communication strategies to caregivers (e.g., slow speech, short sentences, yes/no questions).

### 2.4 Pain Management
- Modalities: local heat therapy, gentle massage, hydrotherapy for lower limbs.
- Ensure proper positioning and stretching to reduce spasticity-related pain.
- Coordinate with medical team for analgesics if needed.

### 2.5 Medical & Nursing Support
- Continue antiepileptic therapy with sodium valproate, monitor for side effects.
- Monitor for and prevent complications: pressure sores, joint contractures, recurrent infections.
- Nutritional support to promote recovery and maintain muscle mass.

### 2.6 Assistive Devices
- Bilateral AFOs for ankle positioning and gait training.
- Standing frame for early weight-bearing.
- Wheelchair with appropriate cushions for mobility and pressure relief.

### 2.7 Caregiver Education
- Training in safe transfers, ROM exercises, splint application, and communication facilitation.
- Education on signs of increased intracranial pressure, seizure activity, and infection.
