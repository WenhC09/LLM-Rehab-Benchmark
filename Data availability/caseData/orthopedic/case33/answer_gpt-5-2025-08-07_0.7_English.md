# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (2–4 weeks):
1. Reduce right upper limb pain (VAS ≤ 2/10) and swelling.
2. Prevent joint contracture and maintain full passive range of motion in the right shoulder, elbow, and forearm.
3. Improve right shoulder and elbow active range of motion by ≥ 10° in flexion and abduction.
4. Increase muscle strength of right shoulder flexion/abduction and elbow flexion by at least half a grade (MMT).
5. Enhance proprioception and light touch sensation in the right upper limb.
6. Improve independence in basic self-care (aim for Modified Barthel Index ≥ 90).

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
1. Restore functional active range of motion of right shoulder and elbow sufficient for daily activities (shoulder flexion ≥ 90°, abduction ≥ 90°).
2. Improve shoulder/elbow muscle strength to at least MMT grade 4.
3. Optimize sensory recovery in C5–C7 dermatomes.
4. Achieve pain-free functional use of right upper limb in daily tasks.
5. Return to pre-injury level of ADL independence (Barthel Index = 100) and improve social participation.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### (A) Physical Therapy
1. **Pain Management**
   - Interferential current (IFC) or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to right shoulder and upper arm, 20–30 min, 1–2 times/day, for neuropathic pain modulation.
   - Local moist heat packs to right shoulder girdle muscles before exercise to promote blood circulation and reduce muscle stiffness.

2. **Range of Motion Training**
   - Passive ROM exercises for shoulder, elbow, forearm, 2–3 times/day, ensuring movements within pain-free range.
   - Gentle joint mobilization Grade I–II (especially glenohumeral joint) to prevent capsular tightness.
   - Pendulum exercises for shoulder relaxation.

3. **Active-assisted to Active Exercise**
   - Active-assisted ROM with pulleys, dowels, or therapist facilitation for shoulder flexion, abduction, and external rotation.
   - Isometric contractions for shoulder and elbow musculature (especially deltoid, biceps, rotator cuff) when tolerated.
   - Gradual progression to isotonic exercises with minimal resistance as muscle strength recovers.

4. **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**
   - Apply to target muscles with MMT ≤ 3 (deltoid, biceps brachii) to stimulate muscle contraction and prevent atrophy.

5. **Postural and Scapular Control**
   - Scapular setting and stabilization exercises to ensure proper biomechanics during upper limb movement.

### (B) Occupational Therapy
1. **Functional Task Training**
   - Simulated ADL tasks involving reaching, grooming, dressing with adaptive strategies.
   - Task-oriented practice to integrate movement into daily function.

2. **Upper Limb Coordination & Dexterity**
   - Fine motor activities for hand and wrist to maintain dexterity.
   - Bilateral upper limb activities to encourage neural reorganization.

3. **Sensory Re-education**
   - Tactile localization, texture discrimination, and temperature differentiation exercises to enhance sensory recovery in affected dermatomes.

4. **Adaptive Equipment Training**
   - Temporary aids for dressing and grooming to maximize independence during recovery.

---

### (C) Pain and Sensory Management
- Desensitization techniques (gentle massage, graded texture exposure) to address altered sensation.
- Education on limb protection to prevent injury in hypoesthetic areas.

---

### (D) Patient & Family Education
- Instruction in home exercise program: daily ROM, gentle strengthening, and posture maintenance.
- Education on joint protection, skin care, and pain management strategies.
- Guidance on activity pacing to avoid overuse and fatigue.

---

### (E) Medical Management Coordination
- Regular review with rehabilitation physician for adjustment of therapy intensity and pain medication if required.
- Close follow-up with orthopedics and neurology regarding fracture healing status and nerve recovery.

---

### (F) Psychological Support
- Counseling to address anxiety, fear of movement, and adaptation to temporary disability.
- Encouragement and motivation to maintain participation in rehabilitation.

---

### (G) Treatment Frequency
- Inpatient: Physical therapy and occupational therapy each 40–60 minutes/day, 5–6 days/week.
- Regular reassessment every 2 weeks to adjust goals and treatment plan based on progress.
