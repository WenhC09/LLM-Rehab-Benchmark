# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Improve active range of motion (ROM) in the right shoulder and elbow joints by at least 10Â° within 4 weeks.
- Increase muscle strength in the right shoulder flexion and abduction to Grade 4 within 4 weeks.
- Reduce pain levels (VAS score) to 1 or below within 4 weeks.
- Enhance sensory awareness in the right upper limb through targeted sensory re-education techniques.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve full active range of motion in the right shoulder and elbow joints within 12 weeks.
- Restore muscle strength in the right shoulder and elbow to at least Grade 5 within 12 weeks.
- Improve the Modified Barthel Index Score to 100/100, indicating full independence in activities of daily living within 12 weeks.
- Facilitate the patient's return to pre-injury occupational and recreational activities within 12 weeks.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### A. Physical Therapy:
- **Passive Range of Motion Exercises:** Initiate gentle passive ROM exercises for the right shoulder and elbow to prevent stiffness and promote mobility.
- **Active-Assisted Range of Motion Exercises:** Gradually introduce active-assisted exercises as tolerated to encourage muscle engagement.
- **Strengthening Exercises:** Implement isometric strengthening exercises for the right shoulder and elbow, progressing to isotonic exercises as strength improves.
- **Stretching Exercises:** Incorporate stretching for the shoulder and elbow to enhance flexibility and prevent contractures.

### B. Neuromuscular Re-education:
- **Proprioceptive Training:** Use balance and coordination exercises to improve proprioception in the right upper limb.
- **Sensory Re-education:** Implement desensitization techniques and graded sensory stimulation to enhance sensory function in the affected areas.

### C. Pain Management:
- **Modalities:** Utilize modalities such as heat, cold, and TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) to manage pain and promote relaxation.
- **Education on Pain Management Strategies:** Provide education on pain management techniques, including relaxation exercises and proper positioning.

### D. Occupational Therapy:
- **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training:** Focus on adaptive techniques and assistive devices to improve independence in grooming, dressing, and toilet use.
- **Functional Task Practice:** Engage the patient in functional tasks that simulate daily activities to enhance motor skills and confidence.

### E. Psychological Support:
- **Counseling and Support Groups:** Offer psychological support to address any emotional or psychological challenges related to the injury and recovery process.

### F. Follow-up and Reassessment:
- Schedule regular follow-up appointments every 2 weeks to monitor progress, adjust the treatment plan as necessary, and ensure the patient is meeting rehabilitation goals.
