No loss of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, or incontinence. Emergency treatment was administered at Hubei Provincial People's Hospital. Diagnostic workup revealed:  
① Bilateral traumatic wet lung with right-sided hydropneumothorax;  
② Fractures of right 1st to 7th ribs;  
③ Comminuted fractures of right scapula and proximal humerus;  
④ Fractures of C6, C7, and T1-T7 spinous processes;  
⑤ Right brachial plexus injury.  
Admitted to ICU, later transferred to Orthopedic Surgery. Underwent "Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) for Right Rib Fractures + Pleural Adhesiolysis" under general anesthesia on July 27, 2023, followed by "ORIF for Right Acromioclavicular Joint Dislocation + Right Brachial Plexus Neurolysis" on August 22, 2023. Postoperative management included anti-inflammatory, analgesic, expectorant, antithrombotic agents, rehabilitation training, and symptomatic treatment. Discharged after stabilization, with residual right shoulder/elbow movement restriction and right upper limb pain/numbness. Admitted to our department for systematic rehabilitation. Diagnosed at outpatient clinic as "Right Brachial Plexus Injury, Post-fracture Recovery Phase." Since onset, mental status and sleep are fair; diet, bowel, and bladder functions normal; physical strength and body weight decreased.

*   **Pain Assessment:** VAS 3/10.  

## II. Auxiliary Examinations  
*   **Electromyography (July 25, 2023):** Electrophysiological evidence of right brachial plexus injury involving C5-C7.  
*   **Brachial Plexus MRI Plain Scan (July 26, 2023):** Increased STIR signal in right C5, C6, C7 nerve roots. Fractures of C6, C7, and T1-T7 spinous processes.
