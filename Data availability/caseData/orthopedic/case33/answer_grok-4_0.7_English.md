# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks):
- Reduce right shoulder and elbow joint pain (VAS score to ≤1/10).
- Improve right shoulder active range of motion (AROM) to 30 flexion and abduction, and right elbow AROM to 30° flexion.
- Enhance right upper limb muscle strength (MMT: shoulder flexion/abduction to 3+, elbow flexion to 3+).
- Improve sensory function in the right upper arm and lateral forearm.
- Achieve independence in basic grooming and dressing tasks (Modified Barthel Index ≥90/100).

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
- Restore right shoulder AROM to ≥90° flexion/abduction and right elbow AROM to ≥90° flexion.
- Increase right upper limb muscle strength (MMT: shoulder flexion/abduction to 4, elbow flexion to 4+).
- Regain near-normal sensory function in the right upper limb.
- Achieve full independence in activities of daily living (Modified Barthel Index 100/100).
- Facilitate return to social and occupational activities with minimal limitations.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy
- **Passive Range of Motion (PROM) Exercises (Weeks 1–4):**  
  - Perform gentle PROM exercises for right shoulder (flexion, abduction, external/internal rotation) and elbow (flexion/extension) to maintain joint mobility and prevent contractures.  
  - Frequency: 3–5 sessions/week, 15–20 minutes/session, guided by a physical therapist to avoid overstretching the brachial plexus.  
- **Active-Assisted Range of Motion (AAROM) Exercises (Weeks 2–6):**  
  - Transition to AAROM for shoulder and elbow using a pulley system or therapist assistance to gradually increase AROM.  
  - Focus: Shoulder flexion/abduction to 30°, elbow flexion to 30°.  
  - Frequency: Daily, 10–15 minutes/session.  
- **Strengthening Exercises (Weeks 4–8 onward):**  
  - Initiate isometric exercises for shoulder flexors, abductors, and elbow flexors, progressing to low-resistance isotonic exercises (e.g., 0.5–1 kg weights) as tolerated.  
  - Include wrist flexor/extensor strengthening to maintain distal function.  
  - Frequency: 3–5 sessions/week, 10–15 repetitions/set, 2–3 sets.  
- **Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF):**  
  - Apply PNF techniques (e.g., rhythmic stabilization) to enhance shoulder and elbow motor control and coordination.  
  - Frequency: 2–3 sessions/week, 10–15 minutes/session.  

### Occupational Therapy
- **ADL Training (Weeks 1–8):**  
  - Focus on adaptive techniques for grooming and dressing using the left hand and assistive devices (e.g., long-handled brushes, button hooks).  
  - Progress to bilateral tasks as right upper limb function improves.  
  - Frequency: 3–5 sessions/week, 20–30 minutes/session.  
- **Fine Motor Training (Weeks 4–8 onward):**  
  - Incorporate tasks like picking up small objects or threading beads to enhance hand dexterity and coordination.  
  - Frequency: Daily, 10–15 minutes/session.  

### Neuromuscular Rehabilitation
- **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES):**  
  - Apply NMES to right shoulder (deltoid, supraspinatus) and elbow (biceps, triceps) muscles to promote muscle activation and prevent further atrophy.  
  - Parameters: 10–20 Hz, 15–20 minutes/session, 3–5 sessions/week.  
- **Sensory Re-education:**  
  - Implement tactile stimulation (e.g., brushing, textured surfaces) and desensitization techniques for the right upper arm and lateral forearm to improve sensory function.  
  - Frequency: Daily, 10–15 minutes/session.  

### Pain Management
- **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS):**  
  - Use TENS over the right shoulder and upper arm to manage neuropathic pain.  
  - Parameters: High-frequency (80–100 Hz), 15–20 minutes/session, 2–3 sessions/day as needed.  
- **Manual Therapy:**  
  - Gentle soft tissue massage and myofascial release for the right trapezius, pectoralis major, and deltoid to reduce tenderness and muscle tension.  
  -: 2–3 sessions/week, 10–15 minutes/session.  
- **Pharmacological Support (in consultation with referring physician):**  
  - Continue low-dose gabapentin or pregabalin for neuropathic pain, titrated based on VAS score and patient tolerance.  

### Modalities
- **Cryotherapy:**  
  - Apply cold packs to the right shoulder to reduce mild swelling and pain.  
  - Frequency: 2–3 times/day, 10–15 minutes/session, for the first 2–4 weeks.  
- **Hydrotherapy (Weeks 4–8 onward):**  
  - Introduce warm water-based exercises in a therapeutic pool to facilitate low-impact AROM and muscle relaxation.  
  - Frequency: 1–2 sessions/week, 20–30 minutes/session.  

### Patient Education and Home Program
- **Education:**  
  - Educate the patient on the nature of brachial plexus injury (axonotmesis, Sunderland Grade III) and expected recovery timeline (3–12 months for nerve regeneration).  
  - Teach proper posture and joint protection techniques to avoid compensatory strain on the left upper limb or spine.  
- **Home Exercise Program:**  
  - Provide a tailored home exercise plan including PROM, AAROM, and light strengthening exercises (e.g., shoulder shrugs, elbow curls with no weight).  
  - Frequency: Daily, 15–20 minutes/session, with written instructions and diagrams.  
- **Psychosocial Support:**  
  - Address concerns about recovery and return to work through regular counseling sessions with a rehabilitation psychologist.  
  - Frequency: Biweekly, 30 minutes/session.  

### Monitoring and Reassessment
- **Weekly Assessments:**  
  - Monitor VAS pain scores, AROM, MMT, and sensory changes weekly to adjust treatment intensity.  
- **Monthly Comprehensive Evaluation:**  
  - Reassess Modified Barthel Index, EMG (if indicated), and functional progress at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.  
  - Adjust treatment plan based on improvements in nerve regeneration and motor/sensory recovery.  

### Precautions
- Avoid aggressive stretching or high-resistance exercises to prevent re-injury to the brachial plexus or surgical sites.  
- Monitor for signs of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) or excessive swelling, and refer to a pain specialist if symptoms worsen.  
- Ensure proper scar tissue management to prevent adhesions, using silicone gel or scar massage as needed.
