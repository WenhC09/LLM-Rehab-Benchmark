### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

*   **Short-term Goals:** Restore nerve regeneration function, promote neural regeneration, alleviate pain, prevent muscle atrophy and joint stiffness, correct potential secondary deformities.
*   **Long-term Goals:** Maximize recovery of the patient's original motor and sensory function in the right upper limb, improve hand function and activities of daily living (ADL) capacity, enable return to normal life and social activities, facilitate return to work or engagement in suitable employment, and enhance overall quality of life.

### 2. Treatment Methods

#### **(I) Pharmacotherapy**

1.  **Neurotrophic Therapy:** Oral Mecobalamin Tablets and Vitamin B‚ÇÅ Tablets to nourish neurons, accelerate axonal extension and nerve myelination, and promote repair of damaged tissues.
2.  **Promoting Blood Circulation and Resolving Stasis:** Acupoint injection with Danhong Injection to improve local blood circulation, promote inflammation absorption, and reduce edema and pain.
3.  **Analgesic Therapy:** Oral Pregabalin Capsules to alleviate neuropathic pain.

#### **(II) Physical Modality Therapy**

1.  **Electrotherapy:**
    *   **Low-Frequency Pulsed Current Therapy and Medium-Frequency Electrotherapy:** Used to stimulate nerves and muscles, prevent muscle atrophy caused by nerve injury, accelerate local blood circulation, and achieve analgesic effects. Medium-frequency electrotherapy also softens scars and releases adhesions.
2.  **Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS):**
    *   **Treatment Protocol:** Utilize the neuropathic pain treatment prescription with the stimulation target at the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1).
    *   **Parameter Settings:** Stimulation intensity at 90% resting motor threshold (RMT), frequency 50Hz, stimulation time 2 seconds, inter-train interval 8 seconds, repeated 20 times, total pulses 600, total treatment time 192 seconds.
    *   **Treatment Frequency:** Once daily, 6 times weekly.
    *   **Treatment Objective:** Modulate cortical excitability and promote neural regeneration and functional recovery of conduction during peripheral nerve injury repair.

#### **(III) Motor Function Training**

1.  **Passive Range of Motion (PROM) Exercises:** Perform full PROM for all joints of the affected upper limb (shoulder, elbow, wrist) to prevent joint stiffness and soft tissue contracture.
2.  **Active Movement and Resistance Training:** Guide the patient in active movement exercises as muscle strength recovers. Initiate resistance exercises when the strength of the affected muscle groups reaches grade 3-4 to maximize muscle strength recovery.
3.  **Coordination Training:** Focus on multi-joint synergistic movements, emphasizing fine motor skill training of the distal limb to improve limb coordination.
4.  **Orthosis Application:** Utilize orthoses to correct poor posture and prevent/correct potential secondary deformities.
5.  **Treatment Frequency:** 45 minutes per session, 6 sessions weekly.

#### **(IV) Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Therapies**

1.  **Tui Na (Therapeutic Massage):**
    *   **Techniques:** Primarily pressing and kneading techniques, combined with kneading-vibrating, friction, and traction techniques. Apply passive mobilization techniques to stiff joints.
    *   **Treatment Objective:** Relax tense muscle tissue, promote local blood circulation, accelerate absorption of pain-inducing substances, thereby reducing upper limb pain.
    *   **Treatment Frequency:** 30 minutes per session, 6 sessions weekly.
2.  **Acupuncture Therapy:**
    *   **Therapeutic Principle:** Adheres to the academic concept of "regulating spirit, tonifying kidney and activating blood circulation".
    *   **Treatment Method:** Apply electroacupuncture stimulation to specific acupoints to improve local microcirculation, promote nerve regeneration and repair, and alleviate neuralgia.
    *   **Selected Acupoints:** Baihui (DU20), Shenmen (HT7), Guanyuan (RN4), Xuanzhong (GB39), Xuehai (SP10), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Hegu (LI4), Waiguan (SJ5), Shousanli (LI10), Xiaohai (SI8), Quchi (LI11), Tianquan (PC2), Yangchi (SJ4), Jianyu (LI15), Jianzhen (SI9), Jianliao (SJ14), etc.
    *   **Treatment Frequency:** 30 minutes per session, 5 sessions weekly.
    *   **Acupoint Injection:** Adjunctive application involving injection of medication into acupoints to promote nerve cell regeneration and accelerate repair of damaged nerves.

#### **(V) Occupational Therapy (OT)**

1.  **Therapeutic Activities:** Engage in fine motor skill training through functional, goal-oriented activities such as pegboard exercises and Gomoku (Five-in-a-Row).
2.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training:** Practice using activities of daily living assistive devices to promote recovery of ADL capacity.
3.  **Treatment Frequency:** 30 minutes per session, 6 sessions weekly.

#### **(VI) Psychological Counseling**

*   Maintain close communication with the patient throughout the rehabilitation process to understand their psychological state and needs. Provide timely psychological counseling and support for negative emotions such as depression and irritability, helping to build rehabilitation confidence.
