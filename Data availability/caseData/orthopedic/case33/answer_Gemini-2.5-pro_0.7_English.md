# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4-6 weeks):
*   **Pain Management:** Reduce resting and activity-related pain in the right shoulder region from VAS 3 to VAS < 2.
*   **Range of Motion (ROM):** Maintain full passive range of motion in the right shoulder, elbow, and forearm to prevent joint contracture and soft tissue adhesion.
*   **Muscle Strength:** Improve muscle strength of the right upper limb, specifically targeting:
    *   Right shoulder flexion and abduction from Grade 3- to Grade 3.
    *   Right elbow flexion from Grade 3- to Grade 3.
*   **Motor Control:** Enhance neuromuscular control and initiate active movement patterns in the right shoulder and elbow.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):** Achieve independence in grooming and dressing the upper body, improving the MBI score from 85 to >90.
*   **Patient Education:** Ensure the patient understands the nature of his brachial plexus injury, the expected timeline for nerve recovery, and the importance of the home exercise program.

### Long-term goals (within 6-12 months):
*   **Muscle Strength:** Achieve functional strength (MMT â‰¥ Grade 4) in all major muscle groups of the right upper limb, particularly the shoulder and elbow flexors/abductors.
*   **Range of Motion (ROM):** Restore full active range of motion of the right shoulder and elbow to match the passive range.
*   **Function:** Achieve complete independence in all ADLs (MBI score 100). Restore hand function to Grade V (Normal Practical Hand).
*   **Pain Management:** Achieve complete resolution of pain or develop effective self-management strategies for any residual neuropathic pain.
*   **Social Participation:** Facilitate return to previous work, hobbies, and social roles.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy (PT)
*   **Range of Motion Exercises:**
    *   **Passive Range of Motion (PROM):** Gentle, full-range passive stretching for the right shoulder (all planes), elbow (flexion/extension), and forearm (supination/pronation). To be performed 2-3 times daily to prevent joint stiffness.
    *   **Active-Assisted Range of Motion (AAROM):** Use techniques such as wand exercises, overhead pulleys, and therapist assistance to encourage active participation in movement within pain-free limits. Focus on shoulder flexion, abduction, and elbow flexion.
*   **Strengthening Exercises:**
    *   **Gravity-Eliminated Active Exercises:** Initiate active exercises for shoulder and elbow flexors/abductors (MMT Grade 3-) on a powder board or in a therapeutic pool to reduce the effects of gravity.
    *   **Isometric Exercises:** Perform isometric contractions for the deltoid, biceps, and rotator cuff muscles to stimulate muscle fiber activation without joint movement.
    *   **Scapular Stabilization:** Initiate exercises to retrain scapulothoracic rhythm and strengthen periscapular muscles (e.g., serratus anterior, rhomboids), which is crucial given the history of scapular and rib fractures.
    *   **Resistive Training:** Continue strengthening for muscles with Grade 4 and above (elbow extensors, wrist and hand muscles) using resistance bands and light weights to maintain strength and function.
*   **Pain Management Modalities:**
    *   **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS):** Apply to the C5-C7 dermatomal distribution to manage neuropathic pain.
    *   **Thermotherapy/Cryotherapy:** Apply moist heat packs to the trapezius and pectoral muscles to reduce muscle tension before stretching. Apply cold packs to the shoulder joint after exercise to reduce inflammation. Caution is required due to sensory deficits.
*   **Neuromuscular Re-education:**
    *   **Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF):** Utilize PNF patterns to facilitate muscle activation and coordinated movement.
    *   **Biofeedback:** Use electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback on the deltoid and biceps to provide visual/auditory cues, helping the patient re-establish a mind-muscle connection.

### Occupational Therapy (OT)
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training:**
    *   Provide task-specific training for dressing, grooming, and toileting.
    *   Teach compensatory strategies and one-handed techniques as temporary measures. Introduce adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled sponge, dressing stick) if necessary to promote independence.
*   **Sensory Re-education:**
    *   Implement a sensory stimulation program for the areas with abnormal sensation (right upper arm and lateral forearm). Use various textures, temperatures, and pressures to enhance sensory feedback and cortical reorganization.
    *   Emphasize safety education to prevent injury (e.g., burns, cuts) to the insensate areas.
*   **Hand Function:**
    *   While grip strength is good, focus on task-oriented activities that require positioning the hand in space (e.g., reaching for objects on a shelf), integrating proximal shoulder/elbow control with distal hand use.
*   **Splinting:**
    *   Evaluate the need for a resting splint to be worn at night to maintain a neutral position and prevent contractures, although not immediately indicated given full passive ROM.

### Patient Education
*   **Injury and Recovery Process:** Thoroughly explain the nature of Axonotmesis (Sunderland Grade III injury), emphasizing that nerve regeneration is a slow process (approximately 1 mm/day) and that consistent rehabilitation is key to maximizing outcomes.
*   **Home Exercise Program (HEP):** Provide a detailed, written, and demonstrated HEP including PROM, AAROM, and isometric exercises.
*   **Joint Protection:** Instruct the patient on how to protect the right shoulder joint from overstretching or impingement during daily activities.
*   **Energy Conservation:** Teach techniques to manage fatigue, which is common after major trauma and during nerve recovery.
