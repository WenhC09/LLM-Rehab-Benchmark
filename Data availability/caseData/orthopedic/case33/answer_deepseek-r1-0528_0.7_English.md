# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (within 4-8 weeks):
- Increase active range of motion of right shoulder flexion to 30° and abduction to 30°.
- Improve manual muscle testing grade of right shoulder flexion, abduction, and elbow flexion to 3+.
- Reduce neuropathic pain to VAS score ≤2.
- Achieve independence in dressing and toilet use, improving Modified Barthel Index to 95/100.
- Initiate sensory re-education to normalize superficial sensation in the right upper arm and lateral forearm.

### Long-term goals (within 6-12 months):
- Restore full active range of motion in right shoulder and elbow joints (e.g., shoulder flexion to 180°).
- Achieve manual muscle testing grade 4 or better in all affected muscle groups (shoulder, elbow).
- Eliminate pain (VAS score 0) and normalize sensation in the right upper limb.
- Attain full independence in activities of daily living (Modified Barthel Index 100/100) and return to pre-injury occupational and social activities.

## 2. Treatment Methods
- **Therapeutic Exercise**  
  - **Range of Motion (ROM) Training:** Perform passive ROM exercises for shoulder, elbow, and forearm (e.g., flexion, abduction, supination) 2 times daily to maintain joint integrity, leveraging the current full passive ROM. Progress to active-assisted ROM using pulley systems or therapist assistance as strength improves, targeting increased active motion.  
  - **Strengthening Exercises:** Initiate isometric exercises for shoulder flexors, abductors, and elbow flexors in gravity-eliminated positions (e.g., sidelying) 10-15 repetitions, 2 sets daily, based on MMT grade 3-. Advance to isotonic exercises with light resistance (0.5-1 kg) as tolerated. Incorporate scapular stabilization exercises (e.g., wall slides) to support shoulder function.  
  - **Neuromuscular Re-education:** Use proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) patterns for shoulder and elbow 3 times weekly to enhance motor control and coordination, addressing decreased muscle tone and absent biceps reflex.  

- **Pain Management**  
  - **Modalities:** Apply transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for 20 minutes daily to reduce neuropathic pain. Utilize heat therapy (moist heat packs) for 15 minutes pre-exercise to alleviate muscle tenderness in trapezius, pectoralis major, and deltoid.  
  - **Activity Modification:** Educate on ergonomic positioning (e.g., shoulder support during ADLs) to minimize pain triggers, avoiding overhead activities initially.  

- **Sensory Re-education**  
  - **Desensitization Techniques:** Perform graded sensory input using textures (e.g., soft to coarse fabrics) on affected areas 10 minutes, 2 times daily to normalize sensation.  
  - **Sensory Retraining:** Incorporate functional tasks (e.g., object identification with vision occluded) to improve proprioception and light touch perception.  

- **Functional Training**  
  - **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training:** Practice task-specific drills for dressing, grooming, and toileting 5 times weekly, using adaptive strategies (e.g., one-handed techniques) to address deficits. Simulate real-life scenarios to improve hand function (current grade IV).  
  - **Upper Limb Coordination Exercises:** Engage in bilateral activities (e.g., tabletop pushing/pulling) to promote integration and prevent over-reliance on the unaffected limb.  

- **Modalities for Nerve Recovery**  
  - **Electrical Stimulation:** Administer functional electrical stimulation (FES) to right shoulder and elbow flexors 20 minutes daily to facilitate axonal regeneration and muscle re-education, based on EMG-confirmed C5-C7 involvement and Sunderland grade III classification.  

- **Patient Education and Home Program**  
  - **Self-Management:** Teach a home exercise regimen (ROM, strengthening, sensory drills) for daily performance, with log tracking. Instruct on pain self-monitoring and joint protection.  
  - **Progress Evaluation:** Schedule bi-weekly reassessments of MMT, ROM, VAS, and ADL to adjust interventions based on recovery trajectory.
