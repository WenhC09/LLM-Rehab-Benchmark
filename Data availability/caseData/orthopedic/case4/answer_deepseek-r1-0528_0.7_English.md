# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term Goals (0-4 weeks post-op)
- Reduce pain to ≤4/10 on VAS scale
- Prevent DVT and pulmonary complications
- Achieve active knee ROM 0°-90°
- Restore ankle active dorsiflexion to ≥0°
- Improve ADL score to ≥60/100
- Reduce HAMA/HAMD scores by 30%
- Maintain cardiopulmonary function parameters within 10% of preoperative values
- Achieve non-weight-bearing (NWB) transfers with assistive devices

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months)
- Restore full weight-bearing ambulation without assistive devices
- Achieve symmetric bilateral lower limb strength (MMT ≥4+/5 throughout)
- Restore functional ROM: knee 0°-130°, ankle dorsiflexion ≥10°
- Normalize ADL score (≥95/100)
- Resume pre-injury cycling activity
- Return to full occupational/social participation

## 2. Treatment Methods
### Phase I: Protective Phase (Weeks 0-2)
* **Orthopedic Management:**
  - Strict NWB status with knee immobilizer
  - Cryotherapy 20min QID for edema/pain control
  - Limb elevation protocol (ankle > heart level)
* **Pain Management:**
  - Multimodal analgesia: scheduled NSAIDs + PRN opioids
  - Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) 80Hz, 30min BID
* **Musculoskeletal:**
  - Quadriceps setting exercises (10 reps/hour awake)
  - Ankle pumps with theraband resistance (15 reps TID)
  - Gentle PROM: knee 0°-75°, ankle neutral positioning
  - Gluteal isometrics in supine position
* **Cardiopulmonary:**
  - Incentive spirometry (10 breaths Q2H while awake)
  - Upper body ergometer (UBE) 10min TID at 50W
  - Diaphragmatic breathing training
* **Functional Training:**
  - Bed mobility training (log-roll technique)
  - Wheelchair mobility training with leg elevation
  - ADL adaptation training (dressing stick, reacher)
* **Psychological:**
  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions 3x/week
  - Relaxation training (guided imagery daily)

### Phase II: Early Mobilization (Weeks 3-6)
* **Advanced Mobility:**
  - Progressive weight-bearing: PWB 25%→50% with platform walker
  - Gait training on level surfaces BID
  - Stair negotiation training (step-to pattern)
* **Joint Mobilization:**
  - Patellar glides (medial/lateral)
  - Tibiofemoral joint distraction (grade I-II)
  - Talocrural posterior glides for dorsiflexion
* **Strength Training:**
  - Closed-chain exercises: mini-squats (0°-30° knee flexion)
  - NMES to quadriceps (50Hz, 10s on/50s off) during exercise
  - Theraband resisted ankle inversion/eversion
* **Cardiopulmonary:**
  - Seated marching with arm ergometry
  - Threshold inspiratory muscle training (30% MIP BID)
* **Functional Integration:**
  - Bathroom safety training with raised toilet seat
  - Kitchen task simulation (weight-shifting drills)
  - Community re-entry planning

### Phase III: Advanced Rehabilitation (Weeks 7-12+)
* **Weight-Bearing Progression:**
  - Advance to FWB with single-point cane
  - Eccentric loading exercises (controlled descents)
  - Perturbation training on foam surfaces
* **Sport-Specific Training:**
  - Stationary cycling (zero-resistance → progressive)
  - Agility ladder drills (forward/backward)
  - Simulated cycling mounting/dismounting
* **Advanced Neuromuscular Re-education:**
  - Single-leg stance progression (eyes open→closed)
  - Proprioceptive training: wobble board → BOSU
  - Plyometric initiation (submaximal hopping)
* **Psychosocial Reintegration:**
  - Goal-setting workshops
  - Peer mentorship with former fracture patients
  - Graded community outings

**Monitoring Parameters:**
- Biweekly ROM/MMT assessments
- Weekly VAS/ADL tracking
- Serial HAMA/HAMD at 4-week intervals
- Monthly pulmonary function tests
- Radiographic fracture healing confirmation at 6/12 weeks
