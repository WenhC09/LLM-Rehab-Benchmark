# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

**Patient:** Male, 35 years old
**Diagnosis:** Right tibiofibular shaft fracture, status post closed reduction and intramedullary nailing.
**Date of Plan Formulation:** November 10, 2021

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (Next 2-4 weeks):
1.  **Pain and Edema Control:** Reduce resting pain from VAS 8/10 to < 4/10. Effectively manage activity-induced pain and control right lower limb swelling.
2.  **Prevention of Complications:** Prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary complications (atelectasis, pneumonia), pressure ulcers, and joint contractures.
3.  **Improve Joint Range of Motion (ROM):**
    *   Right Knee: Achieve 0°–90° active ROM.
    *   Right Ankle: Achieve neutral dorsiflexion (0°) and at least 30° of active plantarflexion to prevent equinus deformity.
4.  **Enhance Muscle Strength:**
    *   Improve right Quadriceps and Hamstrings strength to 4/5.
    *   Improve right Tibialis Anterior and Gastrocnemius strength to 3/5.
    *   Maintain strength in the left lower limb and both upper limbs.
5.  **Improve Functional Independence:**
    *   Achieve independence in bed mobility and transfers (bed-to-chair).
    *   Master safe ambulation with assistive devices (e.g., walker or crutches) under strict non-weight bearing (NWB) or touch-down weight bearing (TDWB) status as prescribed by the orthopedic surgeon.
    *   Improve Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score from 45 to ≥ 60.
6.  **Psychological Support:** Reduce anxiety and depression symptoms. Decrease HAMA score to < 14 and HAMD score to < 17.
7.  **Patient Education:** Ensure the patient and his family understand the diagnosis, treatment plan, weight-bearing precautions, home exercise program, and signs of potential complications.

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
1.  **Full Weight-Bearing and Normal Gait:** Achieve independent ambulation on all surfaces without assistive devices and with a normal, pain-free gait pattern.
2.  **Restore Full Function:**
    *   Achieve full, pain-free active ROM in the right knee and ankle joints, equal to the contralateral side.
    *   Achieve 5/5 muscle strength in all major muscle groups of the right lower limb.
3.  **Independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL):** Achieve MBI score of 100/100.
4.  **Psychological Well-being:** Resolve anxiety-depression state (HAMA/HAMD scores within normal range).
5.  **Return to Vocation and Recreation:** Enable return to previous work and recreational activities, including cycling.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Physical Therapy (PT)

**Phase I: Early Protective Phase (Weeks 0-2, or until cleared for PWB)**

1.  **Pain and Edema Management:**
    *   **Cryotherapy:** Apply ice packs to the right lower leg for 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times daily, especially after exercise.
    *   **Elevation:** Keep the right lower limb elevated above heart level whenever resting.
    *   **Compression:** Use of a compression wrap or stocking, ensuring it does not compromise distal circulation.
2.  **Therapeutic Exercise:**
    *   **ROM Exercises:**
        *   **Right Ankle:** Gentle active, active-assisted, and passive ROM exercises for dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, and eversion. Crucial focus on achieving neutral dorsiflexion.
        *   **Right Knee:** Active and active-assisted ROM exercises within pain-free limits (e.g., heel slides).
        *   **Toes/Hip:** Active ROM for toes (flexion/extension) and hip (abduction, adduction, flexion) to maintain mobility and promote circulation.
    *   **Strengthening Exercises:**
        *   **Isometrics:** Quadriceps sets, gluteal sets, hamstring sets for the right leg (10-second hold, 10 repetitions, several times a day).
        *   **Active Strengthening:** Straight leg raises (if pain allows and without extensor lag), hip abduction/adduction exercises.
        *   **Contralateral and Upper Body:** Strengthening exercises for the left leg and both arms to prepare for and support ambulation with assistive devices.
3.  **Mobility and Gait Training:**
    *   **Bed Mobility:** Training in rolling, bridging, and moving up/down in bed.
    *   **Transfer Training:** Instruction on safe transfers from bed to chair/wheelchair/commode.
    *   **Gait Training:** Begin ambulation with a walker or axillary crutches, strictly adhering to the surgeon's prescribed weight-bearing status (initially NWB). Emphasize safety and proper technique.

### B. Occupational Therapy (OT)

1.  **ADL Training:**
    *   Instruction in adaptive techniques for lower body dressing, bathing, and toileting while maintaining weight-bearing precautions.
    *   Prescription and training in the use of adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled shoe horn, sock aid, reacher, shower chair, raised toilet seat).
2.  **Upper Extremity Conditioning:** A targeted program to improve upper body and core strength essential for proficient use of crutches and transfers.

### C. Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation

1.  **Breathing Exercises:**
    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing and Deep Breathing:** To improve ventilation, prevent atelectasis, and manage pain/anxiety. Perform 5-10 deep breaths every hour while awake.
2.  **Respiratory Muscle Training:**
    *   Given the low MIP (-40 cmH₂O), initiate inspiratory muscle training (IMT) with a resistive device to improve respiratory muscle strength and endurance.
3.  **Aerobic Conditioning:**
    *   Initiate upper body ergometry (arm bike) for 15-20 minutes daily to maintain cardiovascular fitness without stressing the injured limb.

### D. Pain Management

1.  **Pharmacological:** Coordinate with the primary surgical team for appropriate analgesic medication.
2.  **Non-Pharmacological:**
    *   **Modalities:** Continue cryotherapy. Consider Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) for pain modulation around the knee and ankle, avoiding the immediate fracture site.
    *   **Positioning:** Educate on optimal positioning for pain relief.

### E. Psychological Intervention

1.  **Psychoeducation:** Provide clear information about the injury, surgical procedure, and expected recovery timeline to reduce uncertainty and anxiety.
2.  **Supportive Counseling:** Establish a therapeutic alliance, allowing the patient to voice concerns and fears. Validate his emotional response to the significant trauma and functional loss.
3.  **Behavioral Activation:** Encourage participation in therapy and small, achievable daily goals to combat feelings of helplessness and depression.
4.  **Relaxation Techniques:** Teach techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation to manage both pain and anxiety.
5.  **Referral:** Given the HAMA/HAMD scores indicating severe distress, a formal consultation with a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist is strongly recommended for consideration of psychotherapy (e.g., CBT) and/or pharmacotherapy.
