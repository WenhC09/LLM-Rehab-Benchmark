# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term (0–6 weeks post-surgery):
- Reduce pain to VAS score ≤ 4/10.
- Improve right knee active ROM to 0°–90° and ankle active dorsiflexion to 0°.
- Enhance right lower limb muscle strength to at least 4/5 for quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius.
- Increase Modified Barthel Index score to ≥ 60/100 for improved ADL independence.
- Reduce anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ≤ 14) and depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ≤ 17).
- Improve pulmonary function (FVC ≥ 3.0 L, FEV1 ≥ 2.6 L, MIP ≥ -50 cmH₂O, MEP ≥ 80 cmH₂O).
- Achieve partial weight-bearing ambulation with assistive devices (crutches or walker).

### Long-term Goals (6–12 weeks post-surgery):
- Achieve pain status (VAS score 0/10).
- Restore full right knee and ankle ROM (comparable to contralateral side).
- Attain normal muscle strength (5/5) in right lower limb.
- Achieve Modified Barthel Index score ≥ 85/100 for near-full ADL independence.
- Normalize psychological status (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ≤ 7, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ≤ 7).
- Restore pulmonary function to pre-injury baseline or better.
- Return to independent ambulation without assistive devices and resume social participation.

## 2 Treatment Methods

### Pain Management
- **Modalities**: Apply ice packs to the right lower leg for 15–20 minutes every 2–3 hours for the first 2 weeks to reduce swelling and pain.
- **Pharmacological Support**: Coordinate with the orthopedic team for appropriate analgesic administration (e.g., NSAIDs or acetaminophen as prescribed).
- **T (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation)**: Initiate TENS around the fracture site (avoiding surgical hardware) for 20 minutes daily to manage pain, starting week 1.

### Physical Therapy
- **Week 1–2 (Acute Phase)**:
  - **Positioning**: Elevate right lower limb to reduce swelling, using pillows during rest.
  - **Isometric Exercises**: Quadriceps and gluteal sets (10 reps, 3 sets daily) to maintain muscle activation without joint movement.
  - **Passive ROM**: Gentle passive ROM for right knee (0°–90 and ankle (plantarflexion/dorsiflexion within pain-free range) therapist, 10 reps per session, twice daily.
  - **Upper Limb and Core Strengthening**: Seated resistance band exercises for upper limbs and core to maintain overall conditioning (3 sets of 10 reps, 3 times/week).
- **Week 3–4 (Subacute Phase)**:
  - **Active-Assisted ROM**: Progress to-assisted knee flexion/extension (0°–90°) and ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion, 10–15 reps, 2–3 sets daily.
  - **Strength Training**: Initiate low-resistance isotonic exercises for quadriceps, hamstrings, and ankle muscles using resistance bands (1–2 kg resistance, 10 reps, 3 sets daily).
  - **Weight-Bearing**: Begin touch-down weight-bearing with crutches as tolerated, guided by orthopedic clearance.
- **Week 5–6 (Early Recovery Phase)**:
  - **Active ROM**: Progress to full active knee ROM (0°–120°) and ankle dorsiflexion to 0°, 15 reps, 3 sets daily.
  - **Strength Training**: Increase resistance for quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius (2–3 kg, 12 reps, 3 sets daily).
  - **Weight-Bearing**: Progress to partial weight-bearing (25–50% body weight) with crutches, guided by orthopedic team.

### Respiratory Therapy
- **Diaphragmatic Breathing**: Practice deep breathing exercises (10 breaths, 3 sets daily) to improve FVC and FEV1.
- **Incentive Spirometry**: Use spirometer for 10–15 breaths every 2 hours while awake to enhance MIP and MEP.
- **Pulmonary Hygiene**: Encourage coughing and deep breathing to prevent atelectasis, 5–10 reps hourly during waking hours.

### Psychological Support
- **Counseling**: Weekly sessions with a clinical psychologist to address anxiety and depression, focusing on coping strategies and relaxation techniques (e.g., mindfulness or guided imagery).
- **Education**: Provide patient and family education on recovery expectations to reduce anxiety and improve compliance.

### Occupational Therapy
- **ADL Training**: Practice bed-to-chair transfers and basic self-care tasks (e.g., dressing, bathing) with adaptive equipment as needed, 30 minutes daily.
- **ive Devices**: Train in the use of crutches or walker for safe mobility, with emphasis on proper technique to prevent falls.

### Progression Monitoring
- **Weekly Assessments**: Monitor VAS score, ROM, MMT, and Modified Barthel Index to adjust therapy intensity.
- **Biweekly Pulmonary Function Tests**: Track FVC, FEV1, MIP, and MEP to evaluate respiratory progress.
- **Psychological Re-evaluations**: Reassess Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scales biweekly to guide psychological interventions.
- **Orthopedic Follow-up**: Coordinate with the surgical team to confirm fracture stability via X-rays (week 4 and 6) before advancing weight-bearing.

### Patient Education
- Educate on proper positioning, weight-bearing precautions, and home exercise program to ensure adherence.
- Provide written and verbal instructions on safe mobility and ADL modifications to enhance independence.

### Precautions
- Avoid excessive weight-bearing until cleared by the orthopedic team to prevent hardware failure or delayed union.
- Monitor for signs of infection, DVT, or compartment syndrome and report immediately to the medical team.
- Limit ankle inversion/eversion exercises to prevent stress on the healing fibula.

This plan is tailored to the patient’s condition on November 10, 2021, post-surgery, and will be adjusted based on ongoing assessments and orthopedic recommendations.
