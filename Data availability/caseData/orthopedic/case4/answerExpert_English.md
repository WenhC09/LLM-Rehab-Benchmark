# **1. Rehabilitation Goals**

## **Short-term Goals:**
*   Promote postoperative wound healing, implement effective pain management and psychological counseling to alleviate patient anxiety and depression.
*   Prevent bed rest complications such as Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Hypostatic Pneumonia, maintain and enhance cardiopulmonary function.
*   Improve muscle strength and endurance of the unaffected limb and non-immobilized joints of the affected limb, gradually increase the Range of Motion (ROM) of the affected knee and ankle joints.
*   Master correct transfer techniques, ultimately achieve independence from bed rest, laying the foundation for partial weight-bearing and assisted ambulation training.

## **Long-term Goals:**
*   Achieve unassisted independent ambulation with normal, coordinated gait.
*   Restore affected limb joint ROM and muscle strength to normal levels, achieve complete independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL).
*   Resolve pain and psychological issues completely, ultimately facilitating the patient's successful return to family life and social roles.

# **2. Therapeutic Methods**

The patient's rehabilitation follows a Perioperative Integrated Rehabilitation Model, involving a multidisciplinary team starting preoperatively and integrating rehabilitation principles throughout the treatment course. Specific therapeutic methods are as follows:

## **I. Comprehensive Management & Early Intervention**
1.  **Psychological Support & Rehabilitation Education:** Provide systematic rehabilitation, nutritional, and psychological education to the patient and family members preoperatively and in the early postoperative period. Utilize effective psychological intervention and counseling to help build rehabilitation confidence, alleviate anxiety and depression stemming from trauma, pain, and functional limitations, and improve treatment compliance.
2.  **Pain Management:** Implement a comprehensive pain management protocol. Utilize analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications to reduce postoperative pain; leverage the analgesic effects of physical agent modalities such as Ultrasound Therapy, Audio Therapy, and Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) to alleviate discomfort; combine psychological suggestion to help build tolerance for anticipated pain during rehabilitation exercises.
3.  **Cardiopulmonary Training & Complication Prevention:** Initiate bedside cardiopulmonary function training (e.g., breathing exercises) early postoperatively to maintain and improve pulmonary function. Simultaneously, instruct the patient on limb elevation and Ankle Pump exercises to effectively prevent DVT formation in the lower limbs.

## **II. Joint Function & Soft Tissue Recovery**
1.  **Range of Motion (ROM) Training:** To prevent joint stiffness, initiate active and passive ROM exercises for the knee and ankle joints within the patient's tolerance early on, progressively increasing joint ROM.
2.  **Physical Agents & Manual Therapy:** Address postoperative scar formation and soft tissue adhesions using a combination of physical agents and manual therapy.
    *   **Physical Agent Modalities:** Apply Ultrasound Therapy, Audio Therapy, and ESWT to utilize their effects (analgesia, scar softening, adhesion release, improved local circulation, promotion of inflammation absorption), alleviating tension in periarticular antagonistic muscles.
    *   **Myofascial Release Technique:** Employ myofascial mobilization techniques to improve tension in the calf muscles and fascia, alleviate pain, and restore soft tissue biomechanical balance.

## **III. Muscle Strength, Balance, & Gait Re-education**
1.  **Muscle Strength Training:** Implement phased, progressive targeted training for lower limb muscle groups.
    *   **Early Phase (Bedrest Period):** Focus on static isometric exercises (e.g., Quadriceps Setting) and Straight Leg Raises to maintain muscle strength in the affected limb. Actively perform maintenance training for the unaffected lower limb and core muscles to prevent disuse atrophy.
    *   **Mid to Late Phases:** Gradually introduce Progressive Resistance Exercises and Progressive Wall Squats as rehabilitation progresses to comprehensively strengthen key muscle groups including the quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius.
2.  **Balance & Coordination Training:** Initiate balance and coordination training once the patient can stand, including single-leg stance, eyes-closed stance, turning, etc., aimed at improving proprioception, balance ability, and coordination in preparation for safe ambulation.
3.  **Progressive Weight-Bearing & Gait Training:**
    *   **Weight-Bearing Strategy:** Begin progressive weight-bearing training at postoperative week 6, following radiographic confirmation of satisfactory fracture healing progression. Using bilateral crutches, start with non-weight-bearing on the affected limb, gradually transition to partial weight-bearing, and ultimately achieve full weight-bearing.
    *   **Gait Analysis & Correction:** Utilize advanced technology for precise gait assessment and guidance. Employ **Skeletal Keypoint Detection Technology** and **RGB-D Cameras** to capture motion trajectories, quantitatively analyzing multiple gait parameters (cadence, gait speed, step width, knee/hip joint angles, center of mass displacement). Simultaneously, integrate **Plantar Pressure Sensors** and **Human Simulation Modeling** technology to analyze walking kinetics, precisely assessing the relationship between gait patterns and knee joint contact forces. Based on this quantitative data, conduct targeted correction training for abnormal gait patterns (e.g., hurried gait, stiff-knee gait) to ensure coordinated and efficient gait.

## **IV. Functional Activities & Community Reintegration**
1.  **Functional Activity Training:** In the later stages of rehabilitation, simulate various functional activities of daily living, such as stair negotiation (ascending/descending), squatting to standing, jogging, and small jumps, helping the patient translate recovered joint function and muscle strength into practical application.
2.  **Assistive Device Use & Crutch Discontinuation Guidance:** Instruct the patient on the proper use of canes, forearm crutches, or axillary crutches. Define crutch discontinuation criteria: walking without aids is only permissible once fracture union is achieved radiographically, the affected limb possesses sufficient muscle strength to support body weight, and a correct gait pattern can be maintained, to prevent the development of difficult-to-correct compensatory gait patterns.
