# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks post-op)
1. Control pain to VAS ≤ 4/10 at rest and ≤ 6/10 during gentle activity.
2. Prevent postoperative complications (DVT, pulmonary infection, joint stiffness, muscle atrophy).
3. Maintain surgical fixation stability and protect fracture healing.
4. Improve right knee active ROM to at least 0°–90°, ankle dorsiflexion to neutral (0°), and plantarflexion to ≥ 30° actively.
5. Increase right lower limb muscle strength by at least one MMT grade for ankle dorsiflexors and plantarflexors.
6. Improve ADL score to ≥ 60/100.
7. Reduce anxiety and depression scores by ≥ 25% from baseline.
8. Improve pulmonary function (MIP ≥ -50 cmH₂O, MEP ≥ 70 cmH₂O).

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months post-op)
1. Achieve pain-free functional mobility and return to pre-injury activity level.
2. Restore right knee ROM ≥ 0°–130° and ankle dorsiflexion ≥ 10°, plantarflexion ≥ 40°, with normal inversion/eversion.
3. Right lower limb muscle strength to MMT 5/5 in major muscle groups.
4. Independent ambulation without assistive devices on level and uneven terrain.
5. ADL score ≥ 95/100; full independence in self-care and community mobility.
6. Psychological status within normal range on standardized scales.
7. Cardiopulmonary function restored to or above pre-injury levels.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Pain Management
- **Cryotherapy:** Apply ice packs to the surgical area (avoiding direct skin contact) for 15–20 min, 3–5 times/day in the first 1–2 weeks.
- **Proper limb elevation** to reduce swelling and associated pain.
- **TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation):** 20–30 min, 1–2 sessions/day to reduce pain and promote muscle activation.
- **Pharmacologic analgesia** as prescribed by the surgical team, coordinated with activity sessions.

### B. Positioning and Protection
- Maintain the operated limb in a neutral alignment; avoid excessive rotation or loading.
- Elevate the limb above heart level when resting to aid venous return.
- Weight-bearing: Follow orthopedic surgeon’s protocol — likely non-weight-bearing (NWB) initially, progressing to partial and full weight-bearing per radiographic healing.

### C. Joint Mobility Training
- **Passive and active-assisted ROM** exercises for the right knee and ankle within pain-free range, starting POD1–2.
- **Knee:** Heel slides, gentle flexion/extension in supine or sitting.
- **Ankle:** Alphabet exercises, gentle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion within allowed range to prevent stiffness.
- **Hip joint mobility** exercises to prevent compensatory limitations.

### D. Muscle Strengthening
- **Isometric exercises** for quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius starting POD1.
- **Progressive resistance training** (elastic bands, ankle weights) for unaffected limbs to maintain overall muscle mass.
- **Electrical muscle stimulation (NMES)** to target weakened ankle dorsiflexors and plantarflexors if voluntary contraction is limited.

### E. Functional Training
- **Bed mobility training** to encourage independence in rolling, sitting, and transferring.
- **Upper limb and core strengthening** to improve crutch or walker use.
- **Gait training** with appropriate assistive devices, focusing on safe technique and weight-bearing restrictions.
- **ADL retraining**: dressing, toileting, and personal hygiene modifications with adaptive techniques.

### F. Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation
- **Breathing exercises:** Diaphragmatic and segmental breathing, 10–15 min, 3–4 times/day.
- **Incentive spirometry**: Encourage use every 1–2 hours while awake.
- **Upper limb ergometer** or seated aerobic activity to maintain cardiovascular conditioning without stressing the fracture site.

### G. Psychological Support
- **Psychological counseling** to address anxiety and depression.
- **Relaxation techniques** such as guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation.
- Provide **education** on the rehabilitation process, expected recovery trajectory, and coping strategies.

### H. Education and Home Program
- Educate patient and family on safe limb handling, signs of complications (infection, DVT), and importance of adherence to rehab.
- Home exercise plan with clear instructions and frequency, adjusted weekly based on progress.

### I. Monitoring and Evaluation
- Reassess pain, ROM, muscle strength, ADL, and psychological status weekly.
- Pulmonary function reassessment every 2–4 weeks.
- Adjust intensity and complexity of exercises according to healing status and tolerance.
