# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Reduce pain in the right lower leg to a VAS score of 4/10 or less within 2 weeks.
- Improve active range of motion (ROM) of the right knee to at least 0°–90° and right ankle to at least 0°–30° of plantarflexion and -10° of dorsiflexion within 4 weeks.
- Increase Modified Barthel Index score to 60/100 within 4 weeks.
- Address anxiety and depression, aiming for a reduction in HAMA to 15 and HAMD to 20 within 4 weeks.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve full functional recovery of the right lower limb, with muscle strength of at least 4/5 in all muscle groups by 12 weeks.
- Restore full range of motion in the right knee and ankle joints by 12 weeks.
- Enable the patient to independently perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and return to pre-injury levels of social participation by 12 weeks.
- Improve pulmonary function parameters to baseline levels by 12 weeks.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### Pain Management:
- Utilize ice therapy for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours to reduce swelling and pain.
- Administer analgesics as prescribed to manage pain levels effectively.

### Physical Rehabilitation:
- **Passive Range of Motion (ROM) Exercises:** Initiate gentle passive ROM exercises for the right knee and ankle to maintain joint mobility, 2-3 times daily.
- **Active Assisted ROM Exercises:** Gradually introduce active-assisted exercises for the right knee and ankle as tolerated, focusing on achieving the short-term ROM goals.
- **Strengthening Exercises:** Begin isometric strengthening exercises for the quadriceps and hamstrings once pain allows, progressing to isotonic exercises as strength improves.
- **Weight-bearing Activities:** Gradually progress to partial weight-bearing with crutches as tolerated, aiming for full weight-bearing by 6 weeks.

### Functional Training:
- Implement gait training with assistive devices to improve ambulation and confidence in walking.
- Incorporate balance and proprioception exercises to enhance stability and prevent future falls.

### Psychological Support:
- Provide psychological counseling to address anxiety and depression, utilizing cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques.
- Encourage participation in support groups or activities that promote social interaction.

### Pulmonary Rehabilitation:
- Implement breathing exercises to improve pulmonary function, focusing on diaphragmatic breathing and incentive spirometry.
- Encourage gradual increase in physical activity to enhance cardiovascular endurance.

### Monitoring and Evaluation:
- Schedule weekly follow-up assessments to monitor pain levels, ROM, strength, and psychological status.
- Adjust the rehabilitation plan based on progress towards goals and patient feedback.
