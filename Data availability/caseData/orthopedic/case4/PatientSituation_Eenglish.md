# Patient Medical Record

## I. Medical Summary

**Basic Information:** Male, 35 years old.

**Chief Complaint:** Pain, swelling, and deformity in the right lower leg following trauma for 3 hours.

**Present Illness:** The patient reported losing balance while cycling on November 5, 2021, subsequently supporting himself with his right foot and sustaining a fall. Immediate pain and restricted mobility were noted in the right lower leg and hip, with visible swelling and deformity of the right lower leg. Admitted to the Emergency Department where X-ray confirmed a right tibia and fibula fracture. Subsequently hospitalized in the Trauma Emergency Department for further management.

**Past Medical History:** Previously healthy. No significant personal history.

**Specialized Physical Examination:**  
- Temperature: 36.2°C  
- Pulse: 80 beats/min  
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths/min  
- Blood pressure: 130/75 mmHg  
- Consciousness: Clear  
- Nutritional status: Moderate  
- Admission method: Wheeled into ward  
- Lungs: Clear breath sounds bilaterally, no dry or moist rales  
- Cardiac and abdominal examinations: Unremarkable  
- Right lower leg: Swelling, tenderness, deformity, restricted movement, palpable bony crepitus  
- Distal circulation: Intact  
- Dorsalis pedis artery: Palpable  
- Distal skin sensation: Normal  
- Pathological signs: Absent  

**Auxiliary Examinations:**  
November 5, 2021 CT scan and 3D reconstruction of the right tibia revealed:  
- Fracture of the distal right tibia  
- Comminuted fracture of the proximal right fibula  
*   **Right Tibia CT Scan:** Clearly demonstrates the fracture line and morphology of the distal right tibia.  
*   **3D Reconstruction:** Intuitively demonstrates the three-dimensional morphology of the comminuted fractures in the distal right tibia and proximal right fibula.  

**Clinical Diagnosis:** Fracture of the right tibial and fibular shafts.

**Fracture Classification:**  
*   By location: Middle-distal third tibial fracture  
*   By stability: Unstable fracture  
*   AO Classification: Type B₁ (Simple fibular fracture at the level of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis)  

**Functional Diagnosis:**  
1.  Restricted right knee joint mobility  
2.  Impaired right ankle joint function  
3.  Ambulation difficulty secondary to right tibiofibular shaft fracture  
4.  Anxiety and depression state  
5.  Decreased cardiopulmonary function  
6.  Impaired activities of daily living (ADL)  
7.  Reduced social participation capacity  

## II. Pre-Rehabilitation Quantitative Assessments

### (A) Preoperative Assessment (November 5, 2021)
