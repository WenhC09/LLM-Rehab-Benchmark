# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (Next 4-6 weeks):

1.  **Medical Stability:**
    *   Control active infections (pneumonia, UTI) and resolve sepsis, achieving afebrile state and normalization of inflammatory markers.
    *   Stabilize hemodynamic status, particularly managing orthostatic hypotension to allow for upright positioning.
2.  **Respiratory Function:**
    *   Improve airway clearance and resolve bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
    *   Enhance effective cough strength (with assistance) to reduce reliance on suctioning.
    *   Initiate weaning from supplemental oxygen therapy.
3.  **Integumentary Integrity:**
    *   Promote healing of the Stage II sacral pressure ulcer.
    *   Prevent the development of new pressure ulcers through a strict positioning and pressure relief protocol.
4.  **Musculoskeletal Integrity & Pain Management:**
    *   Maintain full passive range of motion (PROM) in all joints to prevent contractures.
    *   Reduce neck/shoulder pain (VAS score < 2).
    *   Manage spasticity to prevent interference with positioning and care.
5.  **Early Functional Mobilization:**
    *   Tolerate upright sitting in a supportive wheelchair for at least 60 minutes, twice daily, without significant orthostatic hypotension.
    *   Establish a consistent and effective neurogenic bowel and bladder management program.
6.  **Patient and Family Education:**
    *   Educate the patient and family on the nature of SCI, medical complications, and the initial rehabilitation process, including their roles and responsibilities.

### Long-term goals (Beyond 6 weeks, looking toward discharge):

1.  **Functional Mobility:**
    *   Achieve modified independence in operating a power wheelchair using appropriate controls (e.g., chin, head array, or sip-and-puff).
2.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):**
    *   Achieve independence in directing all personal care.
    *   Achieve modified independence in some self-care tasks (e.g., feeding, grooming) using adaptive equipment and splints, contingent on any motor recovery in C5-C6 myotomes.
3.  **Respiratory Independence:**
    *   If clinically appropriate, progress towards tracheostomy decannulation.
    *   Achieve independence with assisted coughing techniques for airway clearance.
4.  **Autonomic Stability:**
    *   Establish self-management strategies for bowel, bladder, and autonomic dysreflexia (with caregiver assistance).
    *   Transition to a routine of clean intermittent catheterization for bladder management.
5.  **Community Reintegration:**
    *   Develop proficiency in using assistive technology for communication, environmental control, and computer access.
    *   Provide vocational and psychosocial counseling to facilitate adjustment and explore future life roles.

## 2. Treatment Methods

**Note:** All therapies will be initiated at the bedside and progressed as medical stability improves. Intensity and duration will be guided by daily assessment of vitals, fatigue, and pain.

### A. Medical and Nursing Management

1.  **Infection Control:** Collaborate with the primary medical team to ensure appropriate antibiotic therapy (e.g., vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia, aztreonam/amikacin for UTI) based on sensitivities. Monitor vital signs, laboratory markers (WBC, CRP, PCT), and clinical status closely.
2.  **Pressure Ulcer Care:**
    *   Implement a strict 2-hour turning and repositioning schedule.
    *   Utilize a pressure-redistributing mattress and wheelchair cushion.
    *   Provide local wound care to the sacral ulcer as per protocol (e.g., hydrocolloid dressing, cleansing).
    *   Ensure high-protein, high-calorie nutritional support to promote healing.
3.  **Orthostatic Hypotension Management:**
    *   Apply abdominal binder and compression stockings before any upright activity.
    *   Utilize a tilt table for gradual acclimatization to verticality, starting at 30 degrees and progressing slowly as tolerated, monitoring blood pressure continuously.

### B. Respiratory Rehabilitation

1.  **Airway Clearance:**
    *   **Manual Assisted Coughing (Quad Cough):** Perform 4-5 times per session, several times daily, especially before and after position changes.
    *   **Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation (e.g., CoughAssist):** Utilize 2-3 times daily to clear deep secretions and re-inflate atelectatic lung segments.
    *   **Tracheal Suctioning:** Perform as needed, based on auscultation and visible secretions, using sterile technique.
2.  **Breathing Exercises:**
    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing Training:** Guide the patient to focus on abdominal excursion during inhalation to maximize diaphragm use.
    *   **Incentive Spirometry:** Although challenging, attempt use to provide visual feedback and encourage deep breaths.
3.  **Ventilator Weaning:** In coordination with the medical team, gradually decrease FIOâ‚‚ and implement trach collar trials as tolerated to build respiratory muscle endurance.

### C. Physical Therapy (PT)

1.  **Positioning:** Ensure proper alignment in bed and wheelchair to minimize spasticity, prevent contractures (especially at shoulders and hips), and offload the sacrum.
2.  **Range of Motion:** Perform PROM exercises for all four extremities, twice daily. Pay special attention to shoulder abduction/external rotation and maintaining hamstring length. Preserve finger flexor tightness to facilitate future tenodesis grasp.
3.  **Strengthening:**
    *   **Active-Assisted & Active ROM:** For elbow flexors (C5) and wrist extensors (C6) within a gravity-eliminated plane to maintain and potentially improve existing strength (MMT 1-2).
    *   **Isometric Exercises:** For all muscle groups with trace contraction.
4.  **Spasticity Management:**
    *   Prolonged, slow stretching of spastic muscle groups (hip adductors, spinal extensors).
    *   Incorporate inhibitive positioning techniques.
5.  **Upright Mobilization:**
    *   **Tilt Table Protocol:** As described above.
    *   **Wheelchair Sitting:** Begin with a reclining, tilt-in-space wheelchair. Start with 30-minute sessions, monitoring for skin redness and hypotension, and gradually increase duration and upright angle.

### D. Occupational Therapy (OT)

1.  **Splinting:** Fabricate and apply bilateral wrist-hand orthoses (resting hand splints) to be worn during rest periods to maintain a functional hand position and prevent contractures.
2.  **Positioning:** Focus on upper extremity positioning in bed and wheelchair to protect joints and manage edema.
3.  **Early ADL Training:**
    *   Begin with patient education on how to verbally direct caregivers for setup and performance of ADLs (bathing, dressing, feeding). This is the first step toward autonomy.
4.  **Assistive Technology (AT) Assessment:**
    *   Introduce and assess for simple environmental control units (ECUs) that can be operated via voice or a simple switch, allowing control over lights, TV, or a nurse call bell to promote a sense of agency.

### E. Bowel and Bladder Management

1.  **Bladder Program:**
    *   Initially, maintain the indwelling catheter, ensuring proper hygiene to manage the active UTI.
    *   Once the UTI is resolved, develop a plan to transition to clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) every 4-6 hours to maintain low bladder pressures and reduce infection risk.
2.  **Bowel Program:**
    *   Establish a daily, scheduled program (e.g., after a meal to utilize the gastrocolic reflex).
    *   Program consists of a bisacodyl suppository followed 20-30 minutes later by digital stimulation.
    *   Monitor for signs of ileus (abdominal distension, decreased bowel sounds) and adjust the program accordingly.

### F. Psychological Support and Education

1.  **Patient Counseling:** Schedule regular sessions with a rehabilitation psychologist to address adjustment to injury, anxiety, depression, and coping strategies.
2.  **Family Education & Training:** Involve family in therapy sessions. Provide comprehensive education on SCI, complication management (skin, bowel, bladder), and safe transfer/positioning techniques.
3.  **Peer Mentorship:** When the patient is medically stable and emotionally ready, introduce the concept of a peer support program.
