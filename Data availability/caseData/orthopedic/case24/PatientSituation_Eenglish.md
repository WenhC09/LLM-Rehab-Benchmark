# Patient Medical Record

## I. Medical Summary

**Patient Information:** Male, 27 years old.

**Chief Complaint:** Impaired mobility of limbs and bowel/bladder dysfunction for over 1 month following trauma.

**Present Illness:** The patient sustained cervical trauma over 1 month ago, resulting in limb numbness and impaired mobility. Emergency cervical CT at a local hospital revealed: **C₄ vertebral burst fracture** with displaced fragments causing **bony spinal canal stenosis** and **spinal cord compression**. After cervical collar immobilization, he was transferred to a higher-level hospital. Two weeks later, he underwent **"Anterior open reduction with spinal canal decompression at C₄ + C₃-C₅ titanium mesh bone grafting with titanium plate internal fixation"**. Postoperative symptomatic treatment stabilized his condition. Currently, the patient remains with a **tracheostomy** on low-flow oxygen therapy. Symptoms persist: limb numbness, weakness, impaired mobility, sensory loss, bowel/bladder dysfunction, and intermittent fever. He was admitted to our department for further rehabilitation under the diagnosis of "**Cervical Spinal Cord Injury, Tetraplegia**".

**Physical Examination:**  
Temperature 38.5°C, HR 89 bpm, RR 25 bpm, BP 92/55 mmHg, SpO₂ 95%.  
Tracheostomy in situ with continuous low-flow oxygen. Able to produce simple vocalizations. Normal cognitive function. Passive positioning, wheelchair-bound. Cooperative with examination.  
Head and face: Normocephalic, no deformity. Eyes: No gaze abnormality. Pupils: Equal, round, reactive to light with normal accommodation. Remainder unremarkable.  
Chest: Symmetric, no deformity. Bilateral decreased respiratory excursion. Increased tactile fremitus. Chest compression test negative. Coarse breath sounds bilaterally with scattered moist rales and rhonchi in lower lobes.  
Heart: No precordial bulge or abnormal apical impulse. Normal cardiac borders. Regular rhythm, no murmurs.  
Abdomen: Distended, soft on palpation. No guarding, tenderness, or rebound tenderness. Normal liver dullness. No shifting dullness. Murphy's sign negative. McBurney's sign negative. Bowel sounds reduced (3-4/min).  
Sacrococcygeal region: Stage II pressure ulcer measuring approximately 4cm × 5cm × 1cm.

**Specialized Examination:** See Rehabilitation Assessment section.

**Ancillary Examinations:**  
*   **Laboratory Tests:**  
    WBC 12.06 × 10⁹/L, Neutrophils 78.6%, Monocytes (absolute) 0.99 × 10⁹/L.  
    Infection Markers: CRP 62.37 mg/L, PCT 5.05 ng/mL, SAA 270.30 ng/L.  
*   **Sputum Culture & Sensitivity:**  
    *Staphylococcus aureus* (Methicillin-Resistant *Staphylococcus aureus*, MRSA). Sensitive to Vancomycin, Linezolid, etc.  
*   **Urine Culture & Sensitivity:**  
    *Serratia marcescens*. Sensitive to Aztreonam, Amikacin, etc.  
*   **Imaging:**  
    *   **Cervical Spine:** Postoperative changes. Well-positioned titanium mesh and plate fixation at C3-C5 levels.  
    *   **Chest CT:** Right interlobar fissure thickening, bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. Linear opacities in right upper lobe anterior segment and bilateral lower lobes.  
    *   **Urinary System Ultrasound:** Chronic cystitis.

**Clinical Diagnoses:**  
*   Cervical Spinal Cord Injury (SCI-C4-ASIA-B);
*   Status post internal fixation for C₄ vertebral burst fracture;
*   Hypostatic pneumonia;
*   Urinary tract infection;
*   Pressure ulcer (Stage II);
*   Orthostatic hypotension.

**Functional Diagnoses:**  
*   Tetraplegia (Motor/Sensory level C₄);
*   Bladder and rectal dysfunction;
*   Central hyperthermia;
*   Neuropathic pain;
*   Respiratory dysfunction;
*   Circulatory dysfunction;
*   Psychological dysfunction;
*   Dystonia;
*   Complete dependence in activities of daily living (ADL);
*   Loss of social participation ability.

## II. Initial Rehabilitation Assessment

1.  **Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury:** SCI-C4-ASIA-B [Motor level C₄, Sensory level C₄, Bulbocavernosus reflex positive, Deep anal pressure (DAP) absent, Voluntary anal contraction (VAC) impaired].
2.  **Balance Assessment:** Unable to sit or stand independently.
3.  **Comprehensive Pain Assessment:** VAS score 4 (cervical/shoulder region).
4.  **Muscle Tone Assessment (Modified Ashworth Scale):**  
    Bilateral hip adductors L/R = 2/2;  
    Bilateral knee extensors L/R = 1+/1+;  
    Spinal extensors L/R = 1+/1+.
5.  **Muscle Strength Assessment:**  
    Bilateral elbow flexors L/R = 2/1;  
    Bilateral wrist extensors L/R = 1/1;  
    Bilateral elbow extensors L/R = 1/1;  
    Strength of all other key muscles: 0.
6.  **Range of Motion Assessment:**  
    Bilateral hip passive flexion L/R = 120°/120°. Passive ROM of all other joints within normal limits.
7.  **Respiratory System Assessment:**  
    Coarse breath sounds, scattered moist rales. RR 25 bpm.  
    Active cough strength: Grade 1 (audible weak cough sound).  
    Sputum viscosity: Grade III (significantly thick, difficult to expectorate, causes dyspnea).  
    mMRC: Grade 0 (dyspnea on strenuous exertion).  
    Borg Dyspnea Scale: 3 (Moderate dyspnea).
8.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assessment:**  
    Quadriplegic Index of Function (QIF) score: 19.
