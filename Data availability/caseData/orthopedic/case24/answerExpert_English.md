# 1. Rehabilitation Goals

## **Short-term Goals:**
*   Improve pulmonary ventilation function, achieve effective sputum expectoration, enhance respiratory muscle strength, and strive for early tracheal tube extubation.
*   Actively prevent and treat existing pressure ulcers.

## **Long-term Goals:**
*   Achieve Grade I sitting balance for the patient.
*   Successfully remove the urinary catheter and improve bladder function.
*   Instruct the patient in the use of assistive devices.
*   Enhance the patient's Activities of Daily Living (ADL) capacity, maximizing their potential for return to family and society.

# 2. Treatment Methods

A comprehensive treatment protocol is implemented for this patient, including the following:

## **Patient and Family Education:**
Provide rehabilitation education to the patient and family members, explaining relevant health knowledge to prevent the occurrence or exacerbation of complications.

## **Pharmacotherapy:**
*   Based on drug sensitivity testing results, administer sensitive antibiotics such as Vancomycin and Linezolid to control hypostatic pneumonia, and utilize appropriate medications to manage neuropathic pain.
*   **Positioning and Posture Management:** The patient wears a cervical collar. Perform log-rolling position changes every 2 hours (alternating supine and lateral positions) to prevent pressure ulcers and pulmonary complications.
*   Utilize an Ankle-Foot Orthosis (AFO) to prevent foot drop. Apply a hand functional position orthosis to maintain wrist-hand functional alignment. Use an air mattress and heel protectors (donut cushions) to prevent and treat pressure ulcers.

## **Core Rehabilitation Training:**
### **Comprehensive Rehabilitation Training:**
*   Apply Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) to prevent muscle atrophy and promote neuromuscular functional recovery.
*   Perform assisted active range of motion (AAROM) exercises for the upper limbs and shoulder girdle. Perform passive range of motion (PROM) exercises for the lower limbs. Conduct pelvic control training.
*   Muscle strength training follows a progressive principle: assisted → active → resisted. Resistance is applied manually by the therapist, using weights, or equipment. Training intensity progresses: low → high → low.
*   This training is performed twice daily for 40 to 50 minutes per session, with 1-2 minutes rest between sets.

### **Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation (Key Treatment Module):**
*   **Sputum Clearance Techniques:**
    *   Employ a combination of postural drainage (via position changes and chest percussion), deep breathing techniques, vibration/percussion, assisted cough technique, suctioning, and mechanical vibration sputum clearance devices to promote secretion removal.
    *   **Assisted Cough Technique:** The therapist places a hand below the patient's xiphoid process and applies an inward and upward abdominal thrust as the patient coughs.
*   **Breathing Exercises:**
    *   Begin with slow, relaxed diaphragmatic breathing. Progressively transition to resisted diaphragmatic training. Simultaneously train residual sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles to compensate for thoracic breathing.
*   **Thoracic Mobility Maintenance:**
    *   Maintain or improve chest wall range of motion through deep breathing, manual stretching, passive joint mobilization, and intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPB).
*   **Device Application:**
    *   Apply an elastic abdominal binder and utilize an External Diaphragm Pacemaker (EDP).
    *   **EDP Electrode Placement:** Place two small electrodes at the outer border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, lower third, bilaterally. Place two large electrodes over the pectoralis major muscle surface at the second intercostal space, midclavicular line, bilaterally.
    *   **EDP Parameters:** "Auto" mode, frequency 9 breaths/min, pulse frequency 30-50Hz, intensity set to patient tolerance. Administer once daily for 30 minutes, for 8 weeks.
*   **Supplementary Training:**
    *   Includes tilt table training, supine cycle ergometer training, hand function electric rehabilitation trainer training, and intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) therapy.

### **Bladder Function Training:**
*   Implement a scheduled fluid intake plan and maintain a voiding diary. Transition from indwelling catheterization to Intermittent Catheterization (IC).
*   Combine with finger acupressure stimulation at the Baliao (BL31-BL34), Shuidao (ST28), Guilai (ST29), and Guanyuan (CV4) acupoints to train bladder sensation.
*   Employ the "Sanyin Matrix" acupuncture technique. This technique combines:
    *   **Matrix Point Selection:** Group 1: Shenque (CV8), Hegu (LI4), Taichong (LR3); Group 2: Guanyuan (CV4), Qihai (CV6), Zhongji (CV3), Shuidao (ST28), Daju (ST27), Guilai (ST29).
    *   **"Sanyin" Point Selection:** Bilateral "Jiayin" points at the midpoint of the inguinal groove and "Jiayin" points 1.5 cm superior to the pubic symphysis.
    *   Stimulate the lower urinary center via needling in a specific sequence and with specific manipulation techniques.

### **Spasticity Management:**
*   Utilize a combined "Acupotomy + Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT)" approach.
*   **Acupotomy:** Performed once weekly. Applied to nodules, trigger points along the bilateral spine and joints, and the myotendinous junctions of spastic muscles.
*   **ESWT:** Performed twice weekly for 8 weeks. Apply radial shock waves to the muscle bellies and myotendinous junctions of spastic muscles. Parameters: Pressure intensity 2 Bar, Frequency 8 Hz, 2000 pulses per site.

### **Acupuncture Treatment:**
*   Based on the principle "Where the meridian passes, it treats the disorder", select acupoints along the Ren Meridian, Kidney Meridian of Foot-Shaoyin (KI), Spleen Meridian of Foot-Taiyin (SP), Liver Meridian of Foot-Jueyin (LR), and Stomach Meridian of Foot-Yangming (ST).
