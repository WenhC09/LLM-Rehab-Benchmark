# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (0-4 weeks):
- Stabilize core body temperature below 37.5°C
- Resolve pulmonary infections (CRP <10 mg/L, resolution of rales)
- Heal stage II pressure ulcer (50% reduction in size)
- Achieve upright tolerance (45° sitting x 30 min without hypotension)
- Establish effective bladder management program (residual <100ml)
- Maintain full passive joint ROM
- Reduce VAS pain score to ≤2
- Develop basic communication methods (eye-tracking board proficiency)

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve independent power wheelchair mobility (chin/joystick control)
- Develop independent respiratory secretion clearance techniques
- Establish complete bowel/bladder management program
- Prevent secondary complications (contractures, DVT, osteoporosis)
- Maximize upper limb function (potential tenodesis grasp)
- Transition to oral nutrition with swallowing safety
- Develop compensatory ADL strategies (self-feeding with adaptive equipment)

## 2. Treatment Methods
### Respiratory Rehabilitation
- **Airway clearance**: Quad coughing technique, postural drainage 3x/day
- **Ventilatory training**: Incentive spirometer with assist (10 reps hourly)
- **Secretolysis**: Nebulized acetylcysteine + hypertonic saline QID
- **Weaning protocol**: Gradual tracheostomy collar trials (starting 15min 4x/day)
- **Breathing exercises**: Pursed-lip breathing with abdominal compression

### Infection Management
- **Targeted antibiotics**: IV vancomycin (per MRSA sensitivity), IV aztreonam (UTI coverage)
- **Urinary management**: Intermittent catheterization q4h (sterile technique)
- **Fever control**: Cooling blanket + hydration monitoring

### Mobility Interventions
- **Positioning protocol**: 2-hour turns with pressure mapping
- **Pressure ulcer care**: Hydrocolloid dressing + offloading cushion (Roho®)
- **Orthostatic training**: Graduated tilt table (starting 15° x 5min daily)
- **ROM exercises**: Passive full-range motion BID (emphasis on shoulders/hands)
- **Spasticity management**: Sustained stretch positioning (ankle splints nightly)

### Neurological Rehabilitation
- **Sensory retraining**: Mirror therapy for neuropathic pain
- **Motor re-education**: EMG-triggered FES (biceps/triceps)
- **Bowel program**: Digital stimulation + bisacodyl suppositories daily
- **Autonomic dysregulation**: Abdominal binder + compression stockings

### Functional Training
- **ADL adaptation**: Mouthstick typing training, environmental control access
- **Wheelchair mobility**: Power wheelchair fitting with chin control interface
- **Swallow evaluation**: Instrumental assessment prior to oral trials

### Adjunctive Therapies
- **Thermoregulation**: Cooling vest during therapy sessions
- **Psychological support**: Daily counseling + peer mentorship
- **Nutrition optimization**: High-protein diet (1.5g/kg) + vitamin C/Zinc

### Monitoring Parameters
- **Daily**: SpO₂, bladder residuals, ulcer dimensions, sputum volume
- **Bi-weekly**: ASIA re-examination, sputum culture, CRP/PCT
- **Monthly**: Urodynamics, seating pressure mapping
