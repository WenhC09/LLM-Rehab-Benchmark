# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4 weeks)
- Maintain and improve joint range of motion to prevent contractures.
- Reduce muscle spasticity and prevent further increase.
- Improve respiratory function: enhance cough effectiveness, facilitate sputum clearance, reduce pulmonary infection risk.
- Promote skin integrity: prevent progression of existing pressure ulcer, promote healing.
- Improve sitting balance with maximal assistance.
- Begin tolerance training for upright posture to reduce orthostatic hypotension episodes.
- Establish effective bladder and bowel management routine to reduce urinary infection risk.
- Pain control to VAS ≤ 3.
- Maintain psychological stability and active engagement in rehabilitation.

### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
- Achieve maximal functional independence within neurological limits (ASIA-B).
- Increase upper limb muscle strength to facilitate powered wheelchair operation.
- Improve respiratory muscle strength to enable effective spontaneous coughing and possibly reduce oxygen dependence.
- Achieve stable independent sitting balance with or without trunk support.
- Heal existing pressure ulcer completely and prevent recurrence.
- Achieve stable bladder and bowel function with reduced infection frequency.
- Improve ADL capacity and social participation ability within environmental and family support framework.
- Enhance psychological adaptation and quality of life.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 Positioning and Joint Mobility
- **Passive range of motion (PROM):** All limbs, 2–3 times/day, focusing on shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles.
- **Positioning:** Maintain neutral alignment; alternate side-lying and supine to reduce pressure risk.
- **Splinting:** Hand/wrist resting splints at night to prevent contracture.

### 2.2 Spasticity Management
- Daily stretching of hip adductors and knee extensors.
- Slow, sustained stretching (≥30 seconds per muscle group).
- Avoid noxious stimuli that may increase tone.

### 2.3 Respiratory Therapy
- **Airway clearance techniques:** Assisted coughing (manual abdominal thrust), mechanical insufflation-exsufflation if available.
- **Breathing exercises:** Diaphragmatic breathing, incentive spirometry under supervision.
- **Sputum management:** Humidification via tracheostomy, nebulization with sterile saline, chest physiotherapy (percussion/vibration).
- Coordinate with infection management team for ongoing MRSA pneumonia treatment.

### 2.4 Pressure Ulcer Care
- **Local wound care:** Stage II ulcer — cleansing with sterile saline, application of appropriate moist wound dressing (e.g., hydrocolloid or foam).
- **Pressure relief:** Reposition every 2 hours in bed, every 15–30 minutes in wheelchair with assistance.
- **Support surfaces:** Use dynamic air mattress and pressure-relieving wheelchair cushion.

### 2.5 Orthostatic Hypotension Management
- **Gradual tilt-table training:** Start at 15–30°, increase as tolerated.
- **Elastic stockings and abdominal binder** to support venous return.
- Monitor BP and symptoms throughout.

### 2.6 Bladder and Bowel Management
- **Bladder:** Intermittent catheterization with strict aseptic technique; monitor residual urine volume; adjust frequency to avoid overdistension.
- **Bowel:** Scheduled bowel program with digital stimulation, suppositories if indicated, high-fiber diet, adequate hydration.

### 2.7 Pain Management
- **Neuropathic pain:** Coordinate with medical team for pharmacologic management (e.g., gabapentinoids).
- Gentle mobilization avoiding aggravating positions.

### 2.8 Muscle Strengthening & Functional Training
- **Residual muscle training:** Active-assisted exercises for elbow flexors/extensors, wrist extensors.
- **Electrical stimulation:** For preserved motor units to prevent atrophy.
- **Sitting balance training:** Start with supported sitting, progress to reduced support as tolerated.
- **Wheelchair skills:** Initiate powered wheelchair assessment and training when upper limb function allows.

### 2.9 Circulatory and Cardiovascular Conditioning
- Passive cycling in bed if available.
- Monitor for autonomic dysreflexia.

### 2.10 Psychological Support
- Regular psychological counselling.
- Peer support introduction.
- Family education for caregiving techniques and emotional support.

### 2.11 Infection Control & Coordination
- Strict adherence to respiratory and urinary infection control protocols.
- Multidisciplinary coordination with infectious disease team for MRSA pneumonia and urinary tract infection management.

### 2.12 Education
- Patient and family education on SCI, prevention of complications, home exercise program, and long-term care planning.
