# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4-8 weeks):
- Improve respiratory function to achieve active cough strength of Grade 2 and reduce sputum viscosity to Grade II.
- Stabilize orthostatic hypotension to maintain BP ≥100/60 mmHg during positional changes.
- Reduce neuropathic pain to VAS score ≤2.
- Enhance upper limb muscle strength (elbow flexors and extensors) to Grade 3 bilaterally.
- Prevent progression of pressure ulcer and promote healing of Stage II ulcer.
- Achieve partial independence in basic ADL (e.g., feeding with assistive devices) with QIF score ≥30.
- Manage infections (pneumonia, UTI) to normalize inflammatory markers (CRP <10 mg/L, PCT <0.5 ng/mL).
- Reduce muscle tone in hip adductors to Modified Ashworth Scale ≤1 bilaterally.

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve assisted sitting balance for ≥30 minutes without support.
- Improve upper limb function to enable basic self-care tasks (e.g., grooming, feeding) with minimal assistance.
- Restore bowel and bladder management with scheduled voiding/catheterization and regular bowel program.
- Eliminate infections and prevent recurrence (no fever, normal sputum/urine cultures).
- Achieve complete healing of pressure ulcer and prevent new ulcers.
- Enhance social participation through wheelchair mobility and communication aids.
- Manage psychological dysfunction to improve emotional well-being and coping strategies.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Respiratory Rehabilitation
- **Airway Clearance Techniques**: 
  - Manual assisted coughing (2-3 sessions/day, 10-15 repetitions/session) to improve sputum clearance.
  - Postural drainage with chest percussion (15 min, 2x/day) targeting bilateral lower lobes.
  - Incentive spirometry (10 breaths, 3x/day) to enhance lung expansion and prevent atelectasis.
- **Breathing Exercises**: 
  - Diaphragmatic breathing training (10 min, 3x/day) to strengthen respiratory muscles.
  - Pursed-lip breathing (5 min, 2x/day) to reduce dyspnea and improve oxygen saturation.
- **Tracheostomy Care**: 
  - Regular suctioning (as needed, sterile technique) to maintain airway patency.
  - Monitor for weaning readiness (SpO₂ ≥95% on room air, stable RR <20 bpm).
- **Infection Management**: 
  - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and Aztreonam for *Serratia marcescens* UTI, as per sensitivity reports. Monitor response via repeat cultures and inflammatory markers weekly.

### B. Neuromuscular Rehabilitation
- **Passive Range of Motion (PROM)**: 
  - Daily PROM exercises for all major joints (10 repetitions/joint, 2x/day) to prevent contractures.
  - Focus on hips, knees, and shoulders to maintain ROM and reduce spasticity.
- **Spasticity Management**: 
  - Baclofen 5 mg TID, titrate as needed (monitor for sedation).
  - Stretching program for hip adductors and knee extensors (15 min, 2x/day) with slow, sustained stretches.
- **Strength Training**: 
  - Active-assisted exercises for elbow flexors/extensors and wrist extensors (10 repetitions, 2x/day) using light resistance (e.g., theraband or manual assistance).
  - Functional electrical stimulation (FES) to elbow flexors/extensors (20 min, 3x/week) to enhance muscle activation.
- **Neuropathic Pain Management**: 
  - Gabapentin 300 mg TID, titrate to effect (target VAS ≤2).
  - Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) over cervical/shoulder region (20 min, 2x/day).

### C. Pressure Ulcer Management
- **Wound Care**: 
  -se ulcer with saline, apply hydrocolloid dressing (change every-4 days or as needed).
  - Monitor wound weekly for reduction and signs of infection.
- **Pressure Relief**:
  - Use pressure-relieving mattress and wheelchair cushion (e.g ROHO cushion).
  - Reposition every 2 hours in bed, every 30 min in wheelchair.
  - Educate caregivers on proper turning techniques.
- **Nutrition**: 
  - Consult dietitian for high-protein, high-calorie diet to support wound healing (target 30-35 kcal/kg/day, 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day protein).

### D. Bowel and Bladder Management
- **Bladder Program**: 
  - Intermittent catheterization every 4-6 hours to prevent overdistension and manage chronic cystitis.
  - Monitor urine output and perform weekly urine cultures to confirm resolution of *Serratia marcescens* infection.
- **Bowel Program**: 
  - Initiate bowel regimen with stool softeners (e.g., docusate 100 mg BID) and suppository (e.g., bisacodyl 10 mg daily).
  - Schedule bowel evacuation daily at consistent time, post-meal to leverage gastrocolic reflex.

### E. Cardiovascular and Orthostatic Hypotension Management
- **Tilt Table Training**: 
  - Gradual tilt table therapy starting at 30° for 10 min, progressing to 60° over 2 weeks (5x/week).
  - Monitor BP and HR during sessions; stop if BP <90/50 mmHg or symptoms of presyncope occur.
- **Compression Therapy**: 
  - Apply abdominal binder and lower extremity compression stockings during upright activities to stabilize BP.
- **Hydration**: 
  - Ensure 2-2.5 L/day fluid intake to support blood volume and prevent dehydration.

### F. Functional and ADL Training
- **Wheelchair Training**: 
  - Train in manual wheelchair propulsion with adaptive grips (30 min, 3x/week) to improve upper limb function.
  - Practice wheelchair transfers with sliding board (under supervision, 2x/day).
- **ADL Training**: 
  - Use adaptive devices (e.g., universal cuff for feeding) to promote partial independence in eating and grooming (30 min/day).
  - Occupational therapy to improve fine motor skills for self-care tasks (30 min, 5x/week).
- **Balance Training**: 
  - Supported sitting exercises on therapy mat (10 min, 3x/week) to improve trunk control.

### G. Psychological and Social Support
- **Psychological Intervention**: 
  - Weekly counseling sessions with clinical psychologist to address adjustment to injury and psychological dysfunction.
  - Teach relaxation techniques (e.g., guided imagery, 10 min/day) to reduce anxiety.
- **Social Participation**: 
  - Introduce augmentative communication devices (e.g., speech-generating device) to enhance interaction.
  - Engage family in training for caregiving and emotional support (weekly sessions).

### H. Monitoring and Follow-up
- Weekly multidisciplinary team meetings to assess progress in respiratory function, infection control, and ADL.
- Re-evaluate muscle strength, spasticity, and QIF score every 2 weeks.
- Monitor pressure ulcer healing and adjust wound care as needed.
- Repeat imaging (Chest CT) in 4 weeks to assess resolution of pneumonia and pleural effusions.
- Adjust medications based on clinical response and side effects.
