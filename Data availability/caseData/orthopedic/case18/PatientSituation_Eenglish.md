# Case Information

## I. Clinical Summary

*   **Demographics**: Female patient, 62 years old. Businesswoman, long-term resident of Inner Mongolia, resides on the 4th floor.
*   **Chief Complaint**: Bilateral knee pain with limited mobility for over 6 years, aggravated for 1 month.
*   **History of Present Illness**: The patient reported experiencing bilateral knee pain (predominantly left-sided) and restricted mobility without obvious precipitating factors over 6 years ago. No associated fever, cough, night sweats, localized redness/swelling, or weight loss were reported. Pain worsened during walking and alleviated with rest. Previous treatment at local hospitals and in Beijing involved unspecified oral and topical medications with insignificant symptomatic relief; pain progressively worsened. Approximately 1 month ago, left knee pain intensified without obvious cause, becoming significant during walking and uphill ambulation, with occasional resting pain. The patient presented to our hospital for further management and was admitted to our department with a provisional diagnosis of "Bilateral Knee Osteoarthritis, Left Side Severe".
*   **Past Medical History**: Generally healthy. Diagnosed with "Rheumatoid Arthritis" at a local hospital over 10 years ago, no anti-rheumatic treatment initiated. History of Hypertension for over 7 years, highest recorded blood pressure ≥160 mmHg. Currently managed with oral Amlodipine Besylate and Telmisartan, with self-reported adequate blood pressure control. Denies history of Diabetes Mellitus, Coronary Heart Disease, or other chronic diseases. Denies history of Hepatitis, Tuberculosis, Bacillary Dysentery, Typhoid, or other infectious diseases. Underwent "Total Hysterectomy" at Baotou Third People's Hospital 10 years ago. No history of trauma or blood transfusion. Denies food or drug allergies. Immunization history unknown.
*   **Physical Examination**: Antalgic gait. No obvious swelling, skin temperature or color abnormalities, localized ulceration, sinus tracts, or rashes observed over bilateral knees. No nodules or masses palpated in bilateral popliteal fossae.
    *   **Left Knee**: Tenderness over peripatellar area and medial joint line. Limited knee joint range of motion (Flexion 5° to 100°). Patellar grind test (+), Apley compression test (+), Drawer test (-), Varus/Valgus stress test (-).
    *   **Right Knee**: Tenderness over peripatellar area and medial joint line. Limited knee joint range of motion (Flexion 0° to 110°). Patellar grind test (+), Apley compression test (-), Drawer test (-), Varus/Valgus stress test (-).
    *   Range of motion in other limb joints was adequate. Muscle strength and tone normal in all extremities. Distal sensation, circulation, and motor function intact. Physiological reflexes present. Pathological reflexes not elicited.
*   **Ancillary Investigations**:
    *   **Preoperative Imaging**: Digital Radiography (DR) showed osteophyte formation, subchondral sclerosis, and joint space narrowing in bilateral knees. Imaging included preoperative full-length weight-bearing DR of bilateral lower limbs (stitched view), preoperative anteroposterior (AP) and lateral DR of the left knee.
*   **Clinical Diagnoses**:
    1.  Bilateral Knee Osteoarthritis (KL grade IV, Left Side Severe)
    2.  Rheumatoid Arthritis
    3.  Hypertension, Stage 2
*   **Functional Diagnoses**:
    1.  Joint Mobility Impairment
    2.  Lower Limb Muscle Weakness
    3.  Balance Impairment
    4.  Gait Abnormality
    5.  Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Impairment
