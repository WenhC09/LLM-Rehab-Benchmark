# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks)
- Reduce left knee pain from VAS 6 to ≤4 at rest and during mild activity.
- Decrease swelling and local heat in the left knee.
- Improve left knee active flexion ROM from 90° to ≥110°, maintain full extension.
- Increase lower limb muscle strength by at least one MMT grade in key groups (knee extensors, hip extensors/abductors).
- Improve HSS score to ≥55 points.
- Enhance ADL score to ≥65 points, enabling independent indoor mobility with or without assistive device.
- Correct antalgic gait pattern to a more symmetrical gait with reduced compensatory movements.

### Long-term goals (within 8–12 weeks)
- Minimize knee pain to VAS ≤2 during daily activities.
- Restore left knee flexion ROM to ≥120°, maintain full extension.
- Achieve MMT grade ≥4 in all major lower limb muscle groups.
- Enable safe, independent ambulation indoors and outdoors, including stair negotiation with minimal discomfort.
- Improve HSS score to ≥75 points and ADL score to ≥85 points.
- Enhance balance and functional mobility to reduce fall risk.
- Promote long-term joint protection strategies and self-management skills.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### (A) Pain and Inflammation Management
- **Physical modalities**:
  - Cryotherapy (ice packs or cold compress) for 15–20 minutes, 2–3 times daily during acute swelling phase.
  - Low-level laser therapy or pulsed ultrasound over periarticular tissues to reduce inflammation and pain.
- **Electrotherapy**:
  - TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) for 20–30 minutes, 1–2 times daily, to modulate pain perception.

### (B) Edema Control
- Elevation of lower limb above heart level for 15–20 minutes several times daily.
- Gentle distal-to-proximal effleurage massage to facilitate venous and lymphatic return (avoid aggressive maneuvers).
- Elastic knee sleeve or compression bandage if tolerated.

### (C) Joint Mobility Training
- **Passive and Active-Assisted ROM**:
  - Gentle passive flexion/extension within pain-free range, 2–3 sets of 10–15 reps.
  - Heel slides, seated knee flexion, and prone knee hangs to encourage gradual ROM gains.
- **Stretching**:
  - Hamstring and calf stretching within comfort limits, hold 20–30 seconds, 2–3 reps/session.

### (D) Muscle Strengthening
- **Isometric exercises** (early stage to avoid joint overload):
  - Quadriceps sets, gluteal sets (hold 5–10 seconds, 10–15 reps, 2–3 times/day).
- **Progressive resistance training** as pain/swelling decreases:
  - Straight leg raises in multiple planes.
  - Seated knee extensions with light ankle weights.
  - Hip abduction/adduction using resistance bands.
  - Begin with low resistance, progress gradually to avoid flare-ups.
  
### (E) Gait Training
- Use of appropriate assistive device (e.g., single-point cane on contralateral side) to unload affected knee during early rehabilitation.
- Practice even step length, heel–toe pattern, and reduced compensatory trunk lean.
- Incorporate balance activities (e.g., weight shifts, mini side steps) on stable surfaces.

### (F) Functional Training
- Sit-to-stand practice from progressively lower seating.
- Step-up and step-down training on low steps, progressing in height.
- ADL practice with joint protection principles (e.g., avoiding deep squats, high-impact activities).

### (G) Balance and Proprioception Training
- Static balance: Standing with feet together, semi-tandem stance, eyes open/closed as tolerated.
- Dynamic balance: Weight shifting, gentle marching in place, progressing to unstable surfaces (foam pad) when safe.

### (H) Patient Education
- Joint protection techniques: Avoid prolonged standing, use supportive footwear, plan rest periods.
- Home exercise program: Daily ROM and strengthening exercises within pain tolerance.
- Weight management advice, considering BMI and load reduction on knees.
- Guidance on recognition of overuse symptoms and when to reduce activity.

### (I) Coordination with Medical Management
- Monitor and coordinate with physician regarding pharmacologic pain control and anti-inflammatory therapy.
- Ensure blood pressure remains controlled during exercise sessions.
- Liaise with rheumatology regarding rheumatoid arthritis management to prevent systemic flare-ups.

### (J) Progress Monitoring
- Reassess pain (VAS), ROM, muscle strength (MMT), HSS, and ADL scores weekly.
- Adjust exercise intensity, modalities, and functional goals according to patient’s tolerance and progress.
