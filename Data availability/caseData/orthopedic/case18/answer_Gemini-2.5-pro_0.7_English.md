## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2-4 weeks)
*   **Pain & Inflammation Control**: Reduce left knee resting and activity pain from VAS 6 to ≤ 3. Alleviate severe swelling and increased skin temperature in the left knee to mild or absent.
*   **Improve Joint Range of Motion**: Increase left knee active range of motion (AROM) from 0°-90° to at least 0°-105°. Maintain full passive extension (0°) to prevent flexion contracture.
*   **Enhance Muscle Strength**: Improve Manual Muscle Test (MMT) grade of key lower limb muscles by at least 0.5-1 grade, specifically targeting:
    *   Left Knee Extensors: from Grade 2+ to Grade 3.
    *   Left Hip Extensors: from Grade 2+ to Grade 3-.
    *   Left Hip Abductors: from Grade 3 to Grade 3+.
*   **Improve Basic Mobility**: Transition from antalgic gait to safe, independent ambulation with a walker or single-point cane for distances up to 50 meters on level ground.
*   **Patient Education**: Ensure the patient can demonstrate understanding of joint protection principles, energy conservation techniques, and her prescribed home exercise program.

### Long-term goals (3-6 months)
*   **Functional Pain Management**: Maintain knee pain at VAS ≤ 2 during routine daily activities.
*   **Optimize Functional Strength**: Achieve MMT Grade ≥ 4 in all major lower limb muscle groups (hip flexors/extensors/abductors, knee flexors/extensors).
*   **Maximize Functional Mobility**: Achieve independent ambulation on level surfaces without an assistive device. Be able to safely ascend and descend at least one flight of stairs using a railing, preparing her for the challenge of her 4th-floor residence.
*   **Enhance Balance and Stability**: Improve dynamic balance to reduce fall risk during walking and turning.
*   **Independence in ADLs**: Achieve independence in all basic and instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), with the use of adaptive equipment as needed. Improve ADL score to > 80 points.
*   **Improve Quality of Life**: Significantly improve the HSS Knee Score to > 70 points, reflecting improved function and reduced pain.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy (PT)

1.  **Pain and Inflammation Management**:
    *   **Cryotherapy**: Apply cold packs to the left knee for 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times daily, especially after therapeutic exercise, to reduce swelling, pain, and local inflammation.
    *   **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)**: Use conventional TENS for pain modulation around the left knee as needed, particularly before or after activity.

2.  **Manual Therapy**:
    *   **Soft Tissue Mobilization**: Gentle massage to the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calf muscles to reduce muscle tension and improve flexibility.
    *   **Joint Mobilization**: Gentle patellar mobilizations (medial/lateral/superior/inferior glides) to address patellofemoral pain and improve mobility. Gentle tibiofemoral mobilizations (distraction, anterior/posterior glides) as tolerated to reduce stiffness.

3.  **Therapeutic Exercise**:
    *   **Range of Motion Exercises**:
        *   Active-assisted and active ROM exercises: Heel slides in supine, wall slides in supine, and seated knee flexion/extension.
        *   Stretching: Gentle stretching for hamstrings, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius-soleus complex to improve muscle flexibility and joint mechanics.
    *   **Strengthening Exercises (Progressive Protocol)**:
        *   **Phase 1: Muscle Activation & Isometric Strengthening**:
            *   **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**: Apply NMES to the left quadriceps during volitional contractions (quadriceps sets) to facilitate muscle fiber recruitment and overcome the significant weakness (MMT 2+).
            *   Isometric exercises: Quadriceps sets, gluteal sets, hamstring sets. Hold for 5-10 seconds, repeat 10 times, several sets per day.
        *   **Phase 2: Open-Chain Strengthening (Non-weight bearing)**:
            *   Straight leg raises (SLR), short-arc quads (SAQ).
            *   Supine/side-lying hip abduction, adduction, and extension exercises.
        *   **Phase 3: Closed-Chain Strengthening (Partial to full weight bearing)**:
            *   As pain allows, progress to: stationary cycling (high seat, low resistance), sit-to-stand transfers, mini-squats, and wall sits.
            *   Focus on strengthening hip abductors (e.g., standing hip abduction with resistance band) to improve pelvic stability during gait.
    *   **Balance and Proprioception Training**:
        *   Start with static balance: Double-leg stance, progressing to tandem stance and single-leg stance with upper extremity support.
        *   Progress to dynamic balance: Weight shifting exercises (anterior-posterior, medial-lateral), controlled reaching activities.

4.  **Functional Mobility and Gait Training**:
    *   **Gait Training**: Begin in parallel bars to work on reducing antalgic patterns (e.g., decreased stance time on the left). Focus on proper heel-strike, weight transfer, and step length symmetry.
    *   **Assistive Device Training**: Progress from parallel bars to a standard walker, then to a single-point cane (held in the right hand) as strength and stability improve.
    *   **Stair Training**: Begin with a single 4-6 inch step. Practice ascending (leading with the right leg) and descending (leading with the left leg). Emphasize control and use of handrails.

### Occupational Therapy (OT)

1.  **ADL Retraining**:
    *   Train in safe techniques for lower body dressing, bathing, and transfers (bed, chair, toilet) using joint protection principles.
2.  **Adaptive Equipment Prescription and Training**:
    *   Recommend and train in the use of a raised toilet seat, shower chair/bench, grab bars, long-handled shoe horn, and sock aid to increase safety and independence while reducing strain on the knees.
3.  **Energy Conservation and Work Simplification**:
    *   Educate on pacing activities throughout the day to avoid overexertion and pain exacerbation.
    *   Discuss strategies for managing tasks related to her work as a merchant and navigating her home environment (e.g., breaking down the 4 flights of stairs into manageable sections with rest periods).

### Patient Education

*   **Condition Management**: Provide clear education on osteoarthritis, differentiating it from her historical RA diagnosis. Explain the role of exercise in nourishing cartilage and strengthening muscles to support the joint.
*   **Pain Management Strategies**: Reinforce the appropriate use of cryotherapy, activity modification, and prescribed exercises for pain control.
*   **Weight Management**: Counsel on the importance of maintaining a healthy body weight to reduce mechanical load on the knee joints.
*   **Home Exercise Program (HEP)**: Provide a detailed, illustrated HEP. Ensure the patient and/or family can demonstrate all exercises correctly before discharge. Emphasize the importance of consistency for long-term success.

### Monitoring
*   Regularly monitor blood pressure before, during, and after exercise sessions due to the history of hypertension.
*   Continuously assess pain levels (VAS) and joint response (swelling, warmth) to guide the progression of the treatment plan. Avoid activities that consistently increase pain >2 points on the VAS scale.
