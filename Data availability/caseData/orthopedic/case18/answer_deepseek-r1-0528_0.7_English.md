# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (0-2 weeks):
- Reduce left knee VAS pain score from 6 to ≤4
- Decrease left knee swelling and local temperature elevation by 1 grade
- Increase left knee active flexion ROM to ≥100°
- Improve quadriceps strength from grade 2+ to grade 3
- Achieve independent bed-chair transfers
- Increase ADL score from 51 to ≥60 points

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve functional left knee ROM (0°-115° flexion)
- Restore quadriceps strength to grade 4/5
- Normalize gait pattern without assistive devices
- Enable independent stair negotiation (particularly critical for 4th-floor residence)
- Reduce HSS Knee Score from 41 to ≥70 points
- Achieve ADL independence (score ≥85 points)
- Establish sustainable home exercise program

## 2. Treatment Methods
### Pain and Inflammation Management:
- **Cryotherapy**: 15-min ice packs QID for acute inflammation control
- **Electrotherapy**: Interferential current (80-150Hz) for pain modulation
- **Pharmacotherapy Coordination**: NSAID timing optimization around PT sessions

### Mobility Restoration:
- **Manual Therapy**: Patellar gliding (medial-lateral mobilization)
- **Continuous Passive Motion (CPM)**: Initial 0°-60° ROM, progressive increase to 0°-90°
- **Active-Assisted ROM**: Heel slides with strap assistance
- **Soft Tissue Mobilization**: Gastrocnemius-soleus stretching

### Strength Training:
- **Isometrics**: Quad sets (10-sec hold × 15 reps, 5x/day)
- **Progressive Resistance**:
  - Week 1: Straight leg raises (SLR) in supine
  - Week 2: Mini-squats (0°-30° knee flexion)
  - Week 3: Terminal knee extension with resistance band
- **Closed Chain Exercises**: Seated leg press (limited to pain-free ROM)

### Functional Training:
- **Gait Re-education**: Parallel bar walking with weight shift training
- **Stair Simulation**: Step training on variable-height blocks
- **Balance Training**: Single-leg stance (assisted → unassisted)
- **ADL Adaptation**: Energy conservation techniques for home management

### Adjunctive Therapies:
- **Aquatic Therapy**: Partial weight-bearing exercises (if facilities available)
- **Compression Therapy**: Knee sleeve for edema management
- **Hypertension Monitoring**: BP checks pre/post strenuous exercises
- **Patient Education**: Joint protection principles and activity pacing

### Progress Monitoring:
- Biweekly reassessment of:
  - ROM (goniometry)
  - MMT strength
  - VAS pain diary
  - HSS and ADL scales
- Rheumatoid arthritis flare monitoring (morning stiffness duration, joint swelling)
