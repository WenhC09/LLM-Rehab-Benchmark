# Rehabilitation Goals

## Short-Term Goals:
Reduce inflammation and alleviate pain, prevent complications, and improve bilateral knee joint range of motion.

## Long-Term Goals:
Improve function of the right ankle, right knee, and left wrist; enhance lower limb muscle strength; increase lower limb mobility; and improve activities of daily living (ADL).

# Treatment Methods

The rehabilitation plan for this case is divided into two main phases: perioperative rehabilitation and inpatient rehabilitation, with specific protocols as follows:

**I. Perioperative Rehabilitation Protocol**

This phase commences on postoperative day 1 and progressively increases training content and intensity.

*   **Postoperative Day 1:** Initiate basic functional exercises upon resolution of anesthesia. Includes:
    *   **Ankle pump exercises:** Twice daily (morning and afternoon), 50 repetitions each session, hold for 10 seconds per repetition.
    *   **Knee extension press against bed exercises:** Twice daily (morning and afternoon), 20 repetitions each session, hold for 10 seconds per repetition.
    *   **Knee weighting exercises:** Apply a 5kg rice bag over the knee joint. Twice daily, 2-3 repetitions per session, hold for 10-20 minutes per repetition.
    *   **Knee dragging exercises in bed:** Twice daily, 3-5 repetitions per session, hold for 10-20 seconds per repetition.
    *   **Ice therapy:** 2-3 times daily, 20 minutes per session, to reduce swelling and pain.

*   **Postoperative Day 2:** Add positional transfer and early mobilization training to the Day 1 regimen.
    *   **Positional transfer training:** Includes sitting up from bed to edge of bed, standing from sitting position at bedside, weight shifting training, and transfers between standing and chair/toilet.
    *   **Ambulation training:** Instruct patient on proper use of walker (sequence: move walker forward, then affected limb, then unaffected limb) or crutches (sequence: move both crutches forward, then affected limb, then unaffected limb).
    *   **Bed mounting training:** Move onto bed with assistance from the unaffected side aiding the affected side during the process.
    *   **Precautions:** Emphasize limiting standing and sitting time to ≤30 minutes per session to prevent lower limb edema.

*   **Postoperative Day 3:** If knee flexion angle <90°, focus on enhancing joint range of motion training.
    *   **Active/assisted knee flexion exercises:** Twice daily, 3-5 repetitions per session, hold for 10-20 seconds per repetition.
    *   **Active/assisted knee press exercises:** Twice daily, 3-5 repetitions per session, hold for 10-20 seconds per repetition.
    *   **Terminal knee extension exercises:** Twice daily, 10-15 repetitions per session, hold for 10 seconds per repetition.

*   **Postoperative Day 4:** Initiate progressive muscle strengthening once full knee extension is achieved against the bed surface.
    *   **Four-directional hip straight leg raise exercises:** Includes hip abduction and adduction as shown in Case Figure 3. Twice daily, 5-10 repetitions per session, hold for 10 seconds per repetition.
    *   **Gluteal muscle exercises:** Twice daily, 5-10 repetitions per session, hold for 10 seconds per repetition.
    *   **Bedside straight leg raise exercises:** Twice daily, 5-10 repetitions per session, hold for 10 seconds per repetition.
    *   **Heel press against bed exercises:** Twice daily, 5-10 repetitions per session, hold for 10 seconds per repetition.
    *   **Stretching exercises:** Target hamstrings, triceps surae (gastrocnemius and soleus), and gluteal muscles. Twice daily, 5-10 repetitions per session, hold for 10 seconds per repetition.

*   **Postoperative Days 5-6:** Continue strengthening overall lower limb muscles and gradually integrate activities of daily living (ADL) training.
    *   **Standing hip exercises:** Includes hip flexion, abduction, adduction, and extension leg raises.
    *   **Stair negotiation training:** Adhere to the principle "up with healthy limb, down with affected limb" (Ascend stairs: unaffected limb first, then affected limb. Descend stairs: unaffected limb first, then affected limb).

**II. Inpatient Rehabilitation Treatment Protocol**

Upon transfer to the Rehabilitation Department, an intensified rehabilitation plan was formulated based on the initial assessment and adjusted per mid-term assessment results.

*   **Initial Rehabilitation Protocol:**
    *   **Muscle strengthening training:**
        *   Supine four-directional straight leg raises: 5 sets × 15 repetitions, hold for 5 seconds per repetition.
        *   Ankle pump exercises: 5 sets × 15 repetitions, hold for 5 seconds per repetition.
        *   Knee flexion-extension resistance training: 5 sets × 15 repetitions, hold for 5 seconds per repetition.
        *   Supine quadriceps isometric contraction training: 5 sets × 15 repetitions, hold for 5 seconds per repetition.
    *   **Joint range of motion training:**
        *   Affected limb dragging exercises in bed: 3 sets × 10 repetitions, hold for 15 seconds per repetition.
        *   Bedside leg dangling exercises: 3 sets × 10 repetitions, hold for 15 seconds per repetition.
        *   Supine affected limb flexion exercises: 3 sets × 10 repetitions, hold for 15 seconds per repetition.

*   **Modified Rehabilitation Protocol (Post Mid-Term Assessment):**
    *   Continue initial protocol and add active-assisted patellar joint mobilization.
    *   **Weight-bearing training:**
        *   Chair-assisted weight shifting training: 2 sets daily × 5 repetitions, hold for 1 minute per repetition.
        *   Step-up/step-down transfer training using railings: 2 sets daily × 5 repetitions, hold for 1 minute per repetition.
    *   **Balance training:**
        *   Bilateral standing on balance pad: 2 sets daily × 5 repetitions, hold for 1 minute per repetition.
    *   **Muscle strengthening training (Intensified):**
        *   Progressive resistance terminal knee extension exercises: 5 sets × 30 repetitions, hold for 5 seconds per repetition.
        *   Quarter squats: 3 sets × 15 repetitions, hold at endpoint for 1 second per repetition.
    *   **Gait training:**
        *   Aquatic walking: 3 sets daily × 5 repetitions, hold for 1 minute per repetition.
