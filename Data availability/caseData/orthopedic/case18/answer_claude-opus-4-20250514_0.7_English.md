# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Reduce pain levels in the left knee to a VAS score of 4 or lower within 4 weeks.
- Improve left knee range of motion to at least 100° of flexion and full extension within 4 weeks.
- Enhance muscle strength of knee extensors to at least Grade 3 within 4 weeks.
- Increase ADL score to 60 points within 4 weeks.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve significant pain relief and maintain a VAS score of 3 or lower within 3 months.
- Restore left knee range of motion to normal limits (0° to 130° of flexion) within 3 months.
- Improve overall muscle strength in lower limbs to Grade 4 or higher within 3 months.
- Enhance functional mobility and independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) to an ADL score of 80 points or higher within 3 months.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### A. Pain Management:
- **Modalities**: Apply ice therapy for 15-20 minutes post-exercise to reduce swelling and pain. Consider TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) for pain relief.
- **Medication**: Continue prescribed analgesics as needed, monitor effectiveness, and adjust as necessary.

### B. Physical Therapy:
- **Range of Motion Exercises**: 
  - Passive and active-assisted range of motion exercises for the left knee to improve flexibility.
  - Gradual progression to active range of motion exercises as tolerated.

- **Strengthening Exercises**:
  - Isometric exercises for knee extensors and flexors to improve muscle strength without stressing the joint.
  - Progress to isotonic strengthening exercises using resistance bands or light weights as tolerated.

- **Balance and Gait Training**:
  - Incorporate balance exercises (e.g., single-leg stands, tandem walking) to improve stability.
  - Gait training with a focus on proper mechanics and reducing antalgic gait patterns.

### C. Functional Training:
- **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training**: 
  - Engage the patient in functional tasks such as sit-to-stand, stair climbing, and walking to enhance independence.
  - Use adaptive equipment as necessary to facilitate safe performance of ADLs.

### D. Education:
- **Patient Education**: 
  - Educate the patient on the nature of osteoarthritis and the importance of adherence to the rehabilitation program.
  - Discuss joint protection techniques and activity modifications to minimize stress on the knees.

### E. Follow-up and Reassessment:
- Schedule regular follow-up assessments every 2 weeks to monitor progress towards goals and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.
- Reassess pain levels, range of motion, muscle strength, and functional abilities to ensure the effectiveness of the rehabilitation program.
