# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

###-term Goals (4–6 weeks):
- Reduce left knee pain (VAS score to ≤3 points).
- Improve left knee active range of motion (AROM) to flexion ≥110° and full extension (0°).
- Increase muscle strength in knee extensors and flexors to at least Grade 4.
- Enhance ADL score to ≥70 points to improve independence in daily activities.
- Improve gait stability and reduce antalgic gait with assistive device use as needed.

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
- Achieve pain or minimal pain (VAS score ≤1) during daily activities.
- Restore left knee AROM to functional levels (flexion ≥120°, full extension).
- Achieve muscle strength of Grade 5 in knee and hip muscle groups.
- Attain HSS score ≥80 points, indicating good knee function.
- Restore full independence in ADLs (ADL score ≥90 points) and eliminate gait abnormalities.
- Enable safe stair climbing for 4th-floor residence without pain or assistive devices.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Pain Management
- **Cryotherapy**: Apply cold packs to the left knee for 15–20 minutes, 3–4 times daily, to reduce swelling and pain, particularly post-exercise or activity.
- **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)**: Use TENS for 20–30 minutes, 2–3 times per week, targeting the peripatellar area to modulate pain perception (VAS reduction).
- **Pharmacological Support**: Coordinate with the treating physician to optimize pain management, potentially including short-term NSAIDs (if not contraindicated due to hypertension or other factors) or acetaminophen for residual pain, ensuring no interaction with current medications (Amlodipine, Telmisartan).

### Mobility Improvement
- **Passive Range of Motion (PROM) Exercises**: Perform therapist-assisted PROM exercises for the left knee, focusing on gentle stretching to achieve flexion ≥95° and full extension, 10–15 repetitions, 2–3 sessions daily.
- **Active-Assisted Range of Motion (AAROM)**: Use a continuous passive motion (CPM) machine or slider board for 20–30 minutes daily, progressing from 90° to 110° flexion over 4 weeks, ensuring pain-free motion.
- **Joint Mobilization**: Apply Grade I–II Maitland mobilizations to the patellofemoral and tibiofemoral joints, 5–10 minutes per session, 3 times per week, to reduce stiffness and improve joint glide.

### Muscle Strengthening
- **Isometric Quadriceps Exercises**: Perform quadriceps sets (holding for 5–10 seconds, 10–15 repetitions, 3 sets daily) to activate knee extensors without joint loading.
- **Progressive Resistance Training**:
  - **Week 1–2**: Initiate straight leg raises (SLR) and seated knee extensions with no resistance, 10–15 repetitions, 2–3 sets daily, targeting knee extensors and flexors (Grade 2+ to 3+).
  - **Week 3–4**: Add ankle weights (0.5–1 kg) for SLR and seated knee extensions, progressing to 15–20 repetitions, 2–3 sets daily, as tolerated.
  - **Week 5–6**: Introduce closed-chain exercises (e.g., partial wall sits, 30–45 seconds hold, 5–10 repetitions, 2 sets daily) to enhance knee and hip muscle strength (targeting Grade 4).
- **Hip Muscle Strengthening**: Include side-lying hip abduction/adduction and prone hip extension exercises, 10–15 repetitions, 2–3 sets daily, with progressive resistance to improve hip abductor/adductor strength (Grade 3 to 4).

### Balance and Gait Training
- **Balance Exercises**: Perform single-leg stance (with support initially) for 20–30 seconds per side, 5–10 repetitions, 2 times daily, progressing to unsupported stance as balance improves.
- **Gait Training**: Use a single-point cane or walker for ambulation training, focusing on heel-toe gait pattern, 10–15 minutes daily. Gradually reduce reliance on assistive devices as strength and balance improve.
- **Proprioceptive Training**: Incorporate wobble board or foam pad exercises, 5–10 minutes daily, to enhance knee joint proprioception and reduce fall risk.

### Functional Training for ADLs
- **Transfer Training**: Practice sit-to-stand transitions using a chair with armrests, 10–15 repetitions, 2 times daily, to improve lower limb strength and ADL independence.
- **air Climbing Practice**: Begin with step-to pattern (using handrail) for 4–6 steps, 5–10 repetitions, 2 times daily, progressing to reciprocal stair climbing as strength and confidence improve.
- **Task-Specific Training**: Simulate daily activities (e.g., carrying light loads, walking on uneven surfaces) for 10–15 minutes daily to enhance functional independence for home environment (4th-floor residence).

### Patient Education and Lifestyle Modifications
- **Education**: Educate the patient on knee osteoarthritis management, including weight management (if applicable), proper footwear, and activity pacing to avoid overexertion.
- **Home Exercise Program**: Provide a written and demonstrated home exercise plan focusing on pain management, ROM, and strengthening exercises to ensure adherence post-discharge.
- **Environmental Modifications**: Recommend installing handrails or a stair lift for the 4th-floor residence if stair climbing remains challenging after 6 weeks.

### Monitoring and Progression
- **Weekly Assessments**: Monitor VAS, AROM, muscle strength, and ADL scores weekly to adjust exercise intensity and modalities. Progress exercises only if VAS remains ≤3 and no swelling exacerbation occurs.
- **Interdisciplinary Coordination**: Collaborate with the orthopedic team to monitor rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension status, ensuring no systemic flares or blood pressure spikes interfere with rehabilitation.
- **Reassessment at 6 Weeks**: Re-evaluate HSS and ADL scores, aiming for HSS ≥60 and ADL ≥70. Adjust the plan to focus on functional training if short-term goals are met.

### Precautions
- Avoid high-impact activities (e.g., running, jumping) to prevent joint stress.
- Monitor for signs of rheumatoid arthritis flare (e.g., increased swelling, warmth) and coordinate with a rheumatologist if observed.
- Ensure blood pressure is monitored during exercise sessions to avoid hypertensive episodes, given the patient’s Stage 2 hypertension history.
