# 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
## **Short-Term Goals:**
Restore patient's ability to void spontaneously, remove the indwelling urinary catheter, and significantly reduce post-void residual (PVR) volume to a safe level (e.g., 30-40ml as postoperatively assessed).

## **Long-Term Goals:**
*   Preserve upper urinary tract (renal) function and prevent complications such as urinary tract infections and renal impairment secondary to urinary retention;
*   Restore and maintain stable lower urinary tract function, improving voiding difficulties caused by neurogenic bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH); ultimately enhancing the patient's overall quality of life.

# 2. Treatment Methods:
A multimodal, stepwise comprehensive rehabilitation strategy is adopted for this case, with specific treatments as follows:

## **I. Conservative Treatment Phase (Preoperative)**
During indwelling catheterization, prepare for bladder function recovery using the following non-surgical methods:
*   **Bladder Training & Fluid Management:** Implement bladder training and establish a fluid intake schedule to prepare for spontaneous voiding.
*   **Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation:**
    *   **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT):** Instruct the patient in PFMT to strengthen pelvic floor muscles, improving urinary control and supporting surgical outcomes.
    *   **Medium-Frequency Electrical Stimulation Therapy:** Apply medium-frequency electrical stimulation to the sacrococcygeal region once daily to modulate relevant nerve function.
*   **Acupuncture Therapy:** Utilize acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment to potentially improve neural regulation.
*   **Pharmacotherapy:** Administer medications to improve voiding, nourish nerves, and combat infection, including Finasteride tablets, Doxazosin sustained-release tablets, Relinqing Granules (Chinese herbal medicine for urinary tract inflammation), and Mecobalamin tablets.

## **II. Surgical Treatment Phase**
Due to the patient's inability to discontinue catheterization, staged Sacral Neuromodulation (SNM) was performed after excluding surgical contraindications:
*   **Stage I Surgery (Test Phase):** Perform sacral neuromodulation lead implantation. Implant the lead into a specific sacral foramen (typically S3), connect to an external stimulator for testing, and evaluate surgical efficacy based on symptom improvement rate (>50%).
*   **Stage II Surgery (Permanent Implant):** Upon confirmation of Stage I efficacy, implant a sacral neurostimulator (pulse generator) subcutaneously in the buttock, connecting it to the previously implanted lead for long-term, continuous neuromodulation.

## **III. Postoperative Rehabilitation & Long-Term Management Phase**
Continue comprehensive rehabilitation post-surgery to consolidate and optimize treatment efficacy:
*   **Physical Therapy:**
    *   **Acupuncture Therapy:** Continue routine acupuncture postoperatively, once daily. Acupoints include: Baihui (GV20), Shenting (GV24), Yintang (EX-HN3), Hegu (LI4), Qihai (CV6), Guanyuan (CV4), Shuidao (ST28), Zhongji (CV3), Zusanli (ST36) (bilateral), Sanyinjiao (SP6) (bilateral), Taixi (KI3) (bilateral), Taichong (LR3) (bilateral).
    *   **Medium-Frequency Electrical Stimulation Therapy:** Apply medium-frequency electrical therapy postoperatively during both Stage I and II, including abdominal treatment sites, to aid functional recovery.
*   **Behavioral Guidance & Training:**
    *   **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT):** Instruct the patient to perform daily PFMT consistently after discharge.
    *   **Intermittent Catheterization (IC):** Guide the patient in IC during the initial recovery phase to ensure complete bladder emptying and monitor PVR volume.
    *   **Lifestyle Guidance:** Advise the patient to maintain adequate hydration, ensure a balanced diet, increase dietary fiber for regular bowel movements, ensure sufficient rest, and prevent colds.
*   **Efficacy Assessment & Follow-up:**
    *   **Treatment Efficacy Monitoring:** Monitor treatment efficacy by instructing the patient to maintain a voiding diary, regularly measuring PVR volume (via ultrasound), and assessing symptom improvement.
    *   **Long-Term Follow-up Plan:** Establish an annual follow-up plan including: assessment of symptom improvement, review of voiding/bowel diaries, completion of quality of life and pain assessment scales, and functional check of the sacral neuromodulation device.
