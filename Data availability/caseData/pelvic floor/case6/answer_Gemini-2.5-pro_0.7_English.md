# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (Target: 1-3 months):
1.  **Achieve Catheter-Free Status:** Successfully remove the indwelling urinary catheter.
2.  **Establish Effective Bladder Emptying:** Implement a bladder management program to consistently achieve a post-void residual (PVR) volume of less than 150 mL.
3.  **Resolve Infection:** Eradicate the current urinary tract infection.
4.  **Patient/Caregiver Independence:** Ensure the patient and/or a designated family member is proficient and independent in performing the prescribed bladder management techniques.
5.  **Prevent Complications:** Avoid acute complications such as urosepsis or acute renal injury.

### Long-term goals:
1.  **Maintain Stable Bladder Management:** Sustain a consistent, effective, and catheter-free bladder management routine.
2.  **Preserve Renal Function:** Protect the upper urinary tract from damage secondary to high bladder pressures or recurrent infections.
3.  **Improve Quality of Life:** Minimize urinary symptoms and the impact of the bladder condition on daily activities and well-being.
4.  **Prevent Chronic Complications:** Mitigate the risk of long-term complications, including recurrent UTIs, bladder stones, and deterioration of bladder compliance.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### (A) Pharmacological Management
1.  **Treat Urinary Tract Infection:** Initiate a course of appropriate antibiotics based on urine culture and sensitivity results to resolve the existing infection before catheter removal.
2.  **Reduce Bladder Outlet Obstruction:** Start treatment with an alpha-adrenergic blocker (e.g., Tamsulosin 0.4 mg once daily) to relax the smooth muscle of the prostate and bladder neck. Monitor the patient for potential side effects, primarily orthostatic hypotension, given his age and cardiovascular comorbidities.

### (B) Bladder Retraining and Management Program
1.  **Trial of Voiding (TOV):** After initiating alpha-blocker therapy and ensuring the UTI is adequately treated, the indwelling catheter will be removed for a trial of voiding.
2.  **Timed Voiding Schedule:** The patient will be instructed to attempt to void by the clock every 3-4 hours during waking hours. This prevents bladder overdistension, which can further impair detrusor muscle function.
3.  **Clean Intermittent Catheterization (CIC):**
    *   **Initiation:** CIC is the cornerstone of management for this patient's detrusor underactivity. The patient will be taught to perform CIC immediately after each timed voiding attempt.
    *   **Purpose:** To ensure complete bladder emptying, measure PVR, and prevent the complications of urinary retention.
    *   **Frequency:** Initially, CIC will be performed 4-6 times per day (after each voiding attempt). The frequency will be adjusted based on the PVR volumes, with the goal of maintaining PVR consistently below 150 mL.
4.  **Voiding Assistance Techniques:**
    *   **Double Voiding:** Instruct the patient to attempt to urinate, relax for a few minutes, and then try a second time to empty the bladder more completely.
    *   **Suprapubic Pressure (Crede's Maneuver):** Cautiously teach the patient to apply gentle, sustained manual pressure to the suprapubic area to assist with bladder emptying. This should only be done if it proves effective and does not cause discomfort.

### (C) Patient and Family Education
1.  **Diagnosis Explanation:** Provide a clear explanation of the dual diagnosis: a weak bladder muscle (neurogenic detrusor underactivity) resulting from his past cerebral infarction, which is unable to overcome even a mild blockage caused by an enlarged prostate (BPH).
2.  **CIC Training:** Provide comprehensive, hands-on training for the patient on the principles and technique of Clean Intermittent Catheterization. If the patient is unable to perform this independently, a family member or caregiver must be trained.
3.  **Fluid Management:** Advise the patient to maintain adequate daily fluid intake (approximately 1.5-2 liters) to ensure good urine flow, but to avoid bladder irritants such as caffeine and alcohol, which can exacerbate urgency.
4.  **Symptom Monitoring:** Educate the patient and family on recognizing the signs and symptoms of a UTI (e.g., fever, cloudy or foul-smelling urine, new or worsening discomfort) and the importance of seeking prompt medical attention.

### (D) Monitoring and Follow-up
1.  **PVR Monitoring:** Maintain a detailed log of voided volumes and catheterized residual volumes to track progress and adjust the CIC schedule. Periodic bladder ultrasound can be used for non-invasive PVR checks once the routine is stable.
2.  **Urological Consultation:** Recommend a follow-up consultation with a urologist to discuss the long-term prognosis and management options for his BPH, including the potential risks and benefits of surgical intervention (e.g., TURP) if conservative management with alpha-blockers and CIC fails to achieve satisfactory results.
3.  **Regular Review:** Schedule a rehabilitation medicine follow-up in 4-6 weeks to review the effectiveness of the treatment plan, assess patient adherence and technique, and make any necessary adjustments. Periodic urinalysis and renal function tests will be performed to monitor for infection and preserve kidney health.
