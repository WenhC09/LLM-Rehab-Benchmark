# Medical Record Information

## I. Medical Summary

### (A) History of Present Illness
Male patient, 84 years old.

*   **Chief Complaint**: Urinary frequency and urgency for 10 years, inability to void spontaneously for over 4 months.
*   **History of Present Illness**: The patient developed urinary frequency and urgency without obvious cause 10 years ago, with nocturia twice nightly. Six months ago, he was hospitalized locally for cerebral infarction without urinary difficulty. Five months ago, he sought treatment for COVID-19 infection and developed acute urinary retention requiring indwelling catheterization. Three subsequent attempts at catheter removal resulted in failed spontaneous voiding. Continuous indwelling catheterization has been maintained since, with currently patent catheter draining pale yellow urine. No hematuria, fever, palpitations, chest tightness, dizziness, or headache reported.

### (B) Physical Examination
Elderly male, alert and oriented, no cognitive impairment. Vital signs: T 36.2°C, P 79 bpm, R 18/min, BP 143/75 mmHg. Bilateral costovertebral angles symmetrical, non-tender. No renal percussion tenderness or palpable renal masses. No tenderness along ureteral courses; no significant masses on percussion or palpation. Indwelling catheter draining pale yellow urine freely. Normal muscle strength and tone in extremities. Abdominal wall reflexes, biceps reflexes, triceps reflexes, and patellar tendon reflexes normal. Babinski sign negative. Meningeal signs negative. Perineal/Saddle area examination: Sensory abnormality noted between anocutaneous junction and bilateral ischial tuberosities. Normal anal sphincter tone, no fecal impaction.

### (C) Auxiliary Examinations

*   **Laboratory Tests**:
    *   Urinalysis: WBC 68.2/μl, RBC 26.5/μl, Protein (±), Specific gravity 1.015.
    *   Renal Function: Serum creatinine 71 μmol/L, Urea 4.9 mmol/L.
*   **Urinary Ultrasound**: Right renal cyst, Prostatic enlargement with calcification.
*   **Cystoscopy**: Elongated posterior urethra. Arcuate elevation of bilateral bladder neck. Fissure-shaped internal urethral orifice. Mild elevation of trigone. Bladder mucosa with congestion and edema. No significant trabeculation or diverticula. Bladder capacity 350 mL. Diagnosis: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH).
*   **Urodynamic Studies**:
    *   **Uroflowmetry**: Qmax 6.5 ml/s, Voided volume 130 mL, Post-void residual (PVR) 301 mL.
    *   **Pressure-Flow Study**:
        *   Filling Phase: Medium-fill rate. Maximum cystometric capacity 340 mL. Detrusor overactivity noted during filling. Normal sphincter tone.
        *   Voiding Phase: Qmax 1 ml/s, Voided volume 100 mL, PVR 240 mL. Maximum detrusor pressure (Pdetmax) 23 cmH₂O. Detrusor pressure at Qmax (PdetQmax) 9 cmH₂O. Linear passive urethral resistance relation (LinPURR) grade I bladder outlet obstruction.
    *   **Diagnosis**: Neurogenic bladder, Grade I bladder outlet obstruction.

3.  Urinary Tract Infection
4.  Urinary Retention
