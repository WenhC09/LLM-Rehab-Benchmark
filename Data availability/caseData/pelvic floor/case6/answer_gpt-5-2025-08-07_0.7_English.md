# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks):
- Maintain unobstructed urinary drainage to prevent further urinary retention and protect upper urinary tract function.
- Control urinary tract infection through appropriate medical management and hygiene education.
- Begin bladder training program to stimulate detrusor activity and improve bladder compliance.
- Educate patient and caregivers on catheter care, perineal hygiene, and signs of infection.
- Stabilize blood pressure through lifestyle guidance in cooperation with internal medicine management.
- Prevent complications related to immobility and advanced age (e.g., skin breakdown, deconditioning).

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months, as medically feasible):
- Improve voluntary voiding ability, aiming to reduce or eliminate the need for indwelling catheter.
- Reduce post-void residual volume to below 100 mL to minimize infection risk and bladder overdistension.
- Improve bladder sensation and detrusor contractility through neuromodulation and training.
- Preserve renal function and prevent recurrent urinary tract infections.
- Optimize functional independence in activities of daily living, considering neurological status post-cerebral infarction.
- Maintain safe mobility and cardiovascular stability to support continence training and overall health.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Bladder Management
- **Catheter strategy**: Continue indwelling catheter temporarily until infection control and initial bladder training preparation are complete.
- **Transition to intermittent catheterization**: Once infection subsides and patient/caregiver are trained, attempt clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) 4–6 times/day to promote bladder cycling and reduce infection risk.
- **Bladder training**:
  - Timed voiding schedule, initially every 2–3 hours during daytime.
  - Gradual increase in bladder filling before voiding attempts, under supervision.
  - Encourage double voiding technique if any voluntary urine flow is present.
- **Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT)**:
  - Gentle pelvic floor contractions coordinated with voiding attempts to facilitate detrusor–sphincter synergy.
  - Avoid excessive straining to minimize intravesical pressure spikes.

### B. Neuromodulation & Physical Therapy
- **Electrical stimulation**:
  - Low-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) over sacral dermatomes or percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) 2–3 times/week to modulate detrusor overactivity and improve bladder emptying.
- **Biofeedback training**:
  - If perineal sensory impairment allows, use biofeedback-assisted PFMT to improve awareness and control.

### C. Infection Control
- Coordinate with urology/infectious disease for antibiotic treatment based on culture results.
- Ensure adequate hydration (taking into account cardiac status).
- Strict catheter care protocol: daily perineal cleansing, closed drainage system, avoid unnecessary disconnections.

### D. BPH Management (in cooperation with urology)
- Continue/commence alpha-blockers to reduce bladder outlet resistance (if no contraindications).
- Evaluate for 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors for prostate volume reduction.
- Monitor post-void residual after medical management; surgical intervention discussed if bladder function and general condition permit.

### E. Neurological Rehabilitation
- Continue secondary prevention for cerebral infarction (antiplatelet therapy, BP control, lipid management).
- Balance training, gait exercises, and cardiovascular conditioning to improve overall function and support continence strategies.

### F. Education & Lifestyle
- Patient and family education on:
  - Bladder diary keeping.
  - Signs of UTI and need for early medical attention.
  - Importance of scheduled voiding and fluid management (avoid excessive evening intake).
- Nutritional advice to maintain hydration and avoid bladder irritants (caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods).

### G. Monitoring & Follow-up
- Weekly assessment during initial phase: residual urine volume, infection signs, bladder capacity.
- Repeat urodynamic testing after 3–6 months of rehabilitation to evaluate intervention effect.
- Renal ultrasound every 6–12 months to monitor upper urinary tract.
