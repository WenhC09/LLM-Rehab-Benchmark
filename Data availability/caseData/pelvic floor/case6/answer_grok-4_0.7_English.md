# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals:
- Improve bladder emptying to reduce post-void residual (PVR) volume to <150 mL within 6 weeks.
- Resolve urinary tract infection (UTI) within 2 weeks, confirmed by normalized urinalysis.
- Enhance pelvic floor muscle control and coordination within 8 weeks.
- Manage hypertension to maintain BP <140/90 mmHg consistently within 4 weeks.
- Prevent complications related to indwelling catheterization (e.g., recurrent UTI, catheter blockage) within 4 weeks.

### Long-term Goals:
- Achieve spontaneous voiding without catheter dependence within 6 months, if feasible based on urodynamic progress.
- Maintain stable bladder function with no detrusor overactivity or minimal symptoms of urgency/frequency.
- Optimize pelvic floor strength and bladder control to prevent incontinence or retention recurrence.
- Sustain cardiovascular stability and prevent secondary complications from cerebral infarction or arteriosclerosis.
- Improve overall mobility and functional independence, considering history of lumbar discectomy.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Bladder Management
- **Intermittent Catheterization Training**:
  - Transition from indwelling catheter to intermittent catheterization (IC) 4–6 times daily, performed by patient or caregiver, to reduce infection risk and promote bladder retraining.
  - Education on sterile technique, catheter care, and monitoring urine output (target: 300–400 mL per void).
  - Schedule: Every 4–6 hours, adjusted based on fluid intake and PVR measurements via follow-up ultrasound.
- **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT)**:
  - Initiate biofeedback-assisted pelvic floor exercises to improve sphincter control and detrusor-sphincter coordination.
  - Protocol: 10–15 contractions (3–5 seconds hold, 5–10 seconds rest) per session, 3 sessions daily.
  - Monitor progress with urodynamic studies every 6–8 weeks to assess detrusor overactivity and sphincter tone.
- **Pharmacological Support**:
  - Continue antibiotics for UTI (based on culture/sensitivity, if available) for 7–14 days, followed by repeat urinalysis.
  - Consider antimuscarinics (e.g., oxybutynin 5 mg BID) or beta-3 agonists (e., mirabegron 25 mg daily) to manage detrus overactivity, titrated based on symptom response and side effects.
  - Alpha-blockers (e.g., tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily) for BPH to reduce bladder outlet obstruction, monitored for hypotension given hypertension history.
- **Bladder Retraining**:
  - Timed voiding schedule (every 2–3 hours during the day) to promote regular bladder emptying and reduce urgency.
  - Fluid management: Limit intake to 1.5–2 L/day, avoiding bladder irritants (caffeine, alcohol, acidic juices).

### B. Hypertension Management
- **Lifestyle Modifications**:
  - Low-sodium diet (<2 g/day) with emphasis on DASH diet principles (fruits, vegetables, lean proteins).
  - Regular BP monitoring (twice daily, morning and evening) with a home BP device, targeting <140/90 mmHg.
- **Physical Activity**:
  - Supervised aerobic exercise (e.g., walking or stationary cycling) for 20–30 minutes, 5 days/week, at moderate intensity (Borg RPE 11–13), adjusted for age and history of cerebral infarction.
  - Avoid heavy resistance training to prevent BP spikes; focus on low-intensity strength exercises (e.g., bodyweight squats, 2 sets of 10 reps, 2–3 times/week).

### C. Neurological and Mobility Rehabilitation
- **Neuromuscular Rehabilitation**:
  - Address neurogenic bladder through sensory stimulation techniques (e.g., perineal sensory training) to improve sensory awareness in the perineal/saddle area.
  - Low-frequency electrical stimulation (e.g., transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, TENS) to pelvic floor muscles, 20 minutes/session, 3–5 times/week, to enhance neuromuscular control.
- **Mobility and Balance Training**:
  - General conditioning exercises to maintain muscle strength and prevent deconditioning (e.g., seated leg extensions, arm curls with light resistance, 2 sets of 10–12 reps, 3 times/week).
  - Balance exercises (e.g., sit-to-stand transitions, tandem stance) to reduce fall risk, considering history of lumbar discectomy and cerebral infarction.
  - Gait training with assistive device (if needed) to ensure safe ambulation, 15–20 minutes/day.

### D. Monitoring and Follow-Up
- Weekly follow-up for first 4 weeks to assess catheterization success, UTI resolution, and BP control.
- Repeat urodynamic studies and urinary ultrasound at 8 weeks to evaluate PVR, bladder capacity, and obstruction grade.
- Neurological reassessment at 3 months to monitor for changes in perineal sensation or sphincter tone.
- Coordinate with urologist for BPH management and potential surgical evaluation (e.g., TURP) if no improvement in bladder outlet obstruction after 3–6 months.
- Regular review of medications to adjust for efficacy, side effects, and interactions, especially given polypharmacy risk.

### E. Patient and Caregiver Education
- Train patient/caregiver on IC technique, catheter hygiene, and recognizing UTI symptoms (e.g., cloudy urine, fever).
- Educate on lifestyle modifications for hypertension and bladder health (diet, fluid management, exercise).
- Provide fall prevention strategies and home safety recommendations, considering age and neurological history.

# Notes for Implementation
- All interventions should be tailored to the patient’s tolerance, with close monitoring for fatigue or cardiovascular strain due to age and comorbidities.
- Multidisciplinary collaboration with urology, neurology, and cardiology is essential to address BPH, neurogenic bladder, and hypertension comprehensively.
- Regular reassessment of goals and treatment efficacy is critical to adapt the plan as needed.
