# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (0-4 weeks):
- Resolve active urinary tract infection (UTI) evidenced by urinalysis (WBC 68.2/Î¼L)
- Achieve intermittent catheterization schedule (4-6x/day) with PVR <100mL
- Establish bladder training protocol to improve bladder capacity compliance
- Prevent upper urinary tract damage from chronic retention
- Educate on fluid management (1.5-2L/day) and caffeine/alcohol restriction

### Long-term goals (>4 weeks):
- Transition to spontaneous voiding with PVR consistently <150mL
- Eliminate indwelling catheter dependency
- Restore bladder-emptying efficiency (Qmax >10mL/s)
- Prevent recurrent UTIs and renal impairment
- Manage BPH-related obstruction through coordinated urological care

## 2. Treatment Methods
### A. Medical Management Coordination
- **Antibiotic therapy** for UTI per culture/sensitivity (pending)
- **Alpha-blocker trial** (e.g., tamsulosin) for BPH-related obstruction (Grade I LinPURR)
- **Hypertension control** optimization (BP 143/75 mmHg)

### B. Bladder Rehabilitation Program
1. **Catheterization Protocol**:
   - Transition from indwelling to **clean intermittent catheterization (CIC)** every 4-6 hours
   - Strict fluid intake diary (1,500mL/day evenly distributed)
   - Catheterization volume targets: 300-400mL/cath

2. **Bladder Retraining**:
   - Scheduled voiding attempts pre-catheterization (every 3 hours)
   - Double voiding technique education
   - Pelvic floor relaxation training during voiding attempts

3. **Toileting Adaptation**:
   - Elevated toilet seat for post-lumbar surgery safety
   - Non-skid flooring and grab bars for fall prevention (cerebral infarction history)

### C. Neuromuscular Re-education
- **Pelvic floor biofeedback** for detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia
- **Sensory integration training** for saddle anesthesia (TENS trial)
- **Crede maneuver modification** with blood pressure monitoring

### D. Monitoring & Prevention
- **PVR tracking** via portable ultrasound 2x/week
- **Renal function surveillance** (monthly creatinine/urea)
- **Skin integrity protocol** for perineal area with altered sensation
- **Constipation management** (stool softeners, fiber) to reduce bladder pressure

### E. Patient/Caregiver Education
- Catheterization technique certification
- UTI symptom recognition (fever, cloudy urine, urgency)
- Blood pressure self-monitoring log
- Emergency action plan for autonomic dysreflexia symptoms
