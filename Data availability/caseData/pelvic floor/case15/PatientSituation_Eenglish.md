# Medical Record Information

## I. History of Present Illness

*   **Patient Profile**: Male, 69 years old.
*   **Chief Complaint**: Urinary leakage for over 1 month after prostate cancer surgery.
*   **Present Illness**: The patient was found to have elevated Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) during a physical examination 2 months ago. He subsequently visited the Urology Department of a local general hospital. Contrast-enhanced MRI suggested "Prostatitis? Malignancy (MT) to be ruled out". Prostate biopsy pathology confirmed "Prostate Cancer". One month ago, he underwent "Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy" under general anesthesia. Postoperative pathology indicated: Acinar adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified (NOS), Pathological Stage pT₄N₁M₀. The urinary catheter was removed 2 weeks postoperatively. Urinary leakage was noted during positional changes, walking, coughing, and sneezing, but not in the supine position. He experiences urinary urgency with bladder filling. Apart from leakage, he can void voluntarily. Nocturia occurs 3-5 times per night, with a nocturnal urine volume of 600-900 mL. He requires an external urinary collection device when going out. Since onset, he reports no fever, fair mental status, normal mood and dietary intake, poor sleep, normal bowel movements, urinary symptoms as described, and no significant weight loss.
*   **Past Medical History**: Coronary Atherosclerotic Heart Disease for 5 years. Hypertension for 2 years, controlled with oral "Losartan Potassium Tablets". Usual blood pressure is around 120/70 mmHg. Denies history of Diabetes Mellitus. No history of smoking, alcohol consumption, or exposure to radioactive materials or toxins.
*   **Family History**: Brother has a history of Prostate Cancer.

## II. Physical Examination

*   **General Examination**: Temperature 36.6°C, Pulse 62 bpm, Respiration 19/min, Blood Pressure 118/68 mmHg. Alert, moderate nutrition, ambulated into the ward. Cardiopulmonary examination showed no significant abnormalities. Abdomen shows scattered small surgical incision scars, well-healed. Normal abdominal wall sensation. Abdomen flat, no tenderness, rebound tenderness, or muscle guarding. Normal bowel sounds.
*   **Specialized Examination**: External genitalia without scars. Localized diminished superficial sensation in bilateral perineal skin. Normal perianal skin sensation. Normal anal sphincter contraction. Bulbocavernosus reflex not elicited.
    *   **Digital Rectal Examination (DRE)**: Oxford Muscle Strength Grading Scale 4/5. Endurance test: 3 seconds/10 seconds. Perineal muscles non-tender. Poor abdominopelvic dissociation during pelvic floor muscle contraction, with compensatory gluteal and abdominal muscle activation. Pelvic floor muscles fully relax after maximal contraction.
    *   **Manual Muscle Testing (MMT)**: Hip flexors (L/R = 4/5), Gluteus medius (L/R = 3/5), Gluteus maximus (L/R = 4/5), Obturator internus (L/R = 3/5), Transversus abdominis strength (assessed using Sahrmann Core Stability Test) 1/5.

## III. Auxiliary Examinations

*   **Pelvic Floor Ultrasound**: Poor bladder filling. Urethral orifice open, funneling observed. Imaging shows funnel-shaped urethral orifice. Bilateral puborectalis and anal sphincter show no significant abnormalities. Valsalva maneuver performed adequately. Post-void residual urine volume < 10 mL.
*   **Urinary System Ultrasound**: Bilateral hydrocele of the testicular tunica vaginalis (right side more pronounced). Left epididymal head cyst. Kidneys and bladder appear normal.
*   **Pelvic Floor Electrophysiological Examination**: Bilateral bulbocavernosus reflex not elicited. Pudendal nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (P40 latency and amplitude) within normal limits.
*   **Electromyography (EMG)**: Anal sphincter shows no significant spontaneous electrical activity. Active recruitment response is fair.

## IV. Diagnosis

1.  Stress Urinary Incontinence
2.  Status Post Radical Prostatectomy
3.  Hypertension Stage 1 (Low-Risk Group)
4.  Coronary Atherosclerotic Heart Disease

## V. Rehabilitation Assessment After Admission (Quantitative Examinations)

Based on the patient's functional impairments, the following standardized assessments were performed after admission:
*   International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Male Short Form (ICIQ-MaleSF)
*   PERFECT Pelvic Floor Muscle Assessment Scheme
*   Bladder Diary
