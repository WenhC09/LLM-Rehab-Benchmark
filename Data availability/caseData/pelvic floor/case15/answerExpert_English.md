### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

**Short-term Goals:**  
Through rehabilitation therapy, enable the patient to fully perceive the pelvic floor muscles and improve isolated contraction ability of the pelvic floor muscles; simultaneously, assist the patient in establishing regular fluid intake and voiding habits.

**Long-term Goals:**  
Through systematic rehabilitation therapy, further consolidate and enhance urinary continence function. Enable the patient to learn preemptive contraction of pelvic floor muscles prior to activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., coughing, sneezing, position changes). Ultimately, achieve the absence of urinary leakage during daily activities involving increased intra-abdominal pressure.

### 2. Treatment Methods

Adopt a comprehensive rehabilitation strategy incorporating behavioral intervention, pharmacotherapy, and physical therapy. Specific methods are as follows:

**Behavioral Intervention**  
*   **Bladder Management and Voiding Diary:** Instruct the patient to record daily voiding patterns and establish a scheduled voiding regimen (every 2-3 hours during daytime).  
*   **Lifestyle Modifications:** Advise the patient on constipation prevention and avoidance of caffeinated beverages. To reduce nocturia, instruct on urge suppression techniques to prolong nocturnal voiding intervals and reduce fluid intake 2 hours before bedtime. Encourage voluntary daytime voiding and reduce reliance on urine collection devices.

**Pharmacological Intervention**  
*   **Enhance Urethral Sphincter Function:** Under physician assessment and monitoring, administer Duloxetine Hydrochloride Enteric-coated Capsules. This medication inhibits serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake, promoting activity of the urethral rhabdosphincter and enhancing pudendal nerve excitability.  
*   **Reduce Nocturia:** Administer Desmopressin Acetate as needed based on nocturnal urine volume. Discontinue once nocturia improves through fluid management.

**Pelvic Floor and Core Muscle Training**  
*   **Pelvic Floor Muscle Biofeedback Training:** During initial treatment phases, utilize surface electromyography (EMG) biofeedback and therapist verbal cues in the supine position to assist pelvic floor muscle contraction exercises. This aims to establish correct muscle contraction perception for subsequent independent training.  
*   **Kegel Exercises:** Emphasize isolated contraction of pelvic floor muscles without compensatory activation of abdominal/gluteal muscles. Protocol includes:  
    *   Slow-twitch Training: Contract pelvic floor muscles for 3 seconds followed by 6 seconds relaxation. 10 consecutive repetitions per set, 5 sets daily.  
    *   Fast-twitch Training: Rapidly contract pelvic floor muscles 25 times per set, 2 sets daily.  
*   **The Knack Maneuver Training:** To address leakage during sit-to-stand transitions, instruct the patient to proactively contract pelvic floor muscles (levator ani and external urethral sphincter) *before* sudden increases in intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., coughing, sneezing, lifting, position changes). This temporarily increases urethral stiffness and intraurethral pressure to prevent leakage. Initiate after the patient achieves clear perception and control of pelvic floor muscles.  
*   **Abdominal Core Muscle Strengthening:** Focus on transversus abdominis activation. Method: Patient assumes hook-lying position (supine with hips/knees flexed). While maintaining transversus abdominis contraction, slowly alternate leg lifts to 70°-90°. Range is limited to where stable transversus abdominis contraction can be maintained.

**Home Exercise Program**  
Post-discharge, establish a long-term home exercise program to consolidate and maintain rehabilitation outcomes. Components include:  
*   Adherence to healthy lifestyle habits and bladder training.  
*   Independent and correct performance of isolated pelvic floor muscle contractions.  
*   Consistent completion of pelvic floor muscle home exercises.  
*   Conscious application of pelvic floor muscle contraction during functional activities to counteract fluctuations in intra-abdominal pressure and prevent urinary leakage.
