# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4-8 weeks):
- Improve pelvic floor muscle strength to Oxford Muscle Strength Grade 5/5 and endurance to 8 seconds/10 seconds.
- Reduce stress urinary incontinence episodes by 50% during daily activities (e.g., walking, coughing, sneezing).
- Enhance abdominopelvic dissociation to minimize compensatory gluteal and abdominal muscle.
- Decrease nocturia frequency to 1-2 times per night.
- Increase patient confidence in managing incontinence without reliance on external urinary collection devices during short outings.

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve full continence during daily activities and eliminate the need for external urinary collection devices.
- Maintain consistent pelvic floor muscle strength and endurance for sustained bladder control.- Optimize core stability (Transversus abdominis strength to Sahrmann Core Stability Test Level 3/5).
- Improve overall quality of life, including better sleep quality and reduced urinary urgency.
- Enhance functional mobility and lower body strength (Hip flexors, Gluteus medius, Gluteus maximus, Obturator internus to Grade 5/5).

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PF)
- **Protocol**: Supervised PFMT sessions 3 times/week, 30 minutes/session, with a trained pelvic floor physiotherapist.
  - Focus on isolated pelvic floor muscle contractions, emphasizing proper technique to avoid compensatory gluteal/abdominal activation.
  - Exercises include: Slow contractions (hold for 3-5 seconds, progressing to 8 seconds; 10 repetitions/set, 3 sets) and quick (1-second holds, 10 repetitions/set, 3 sets).
  - Biofeedback using surface EMG to enhance patient awareness of pelvic floor muscle activation and relaxation.
- **Home Exercise Program**: Daily PFMT (2 sets of slow and quick contractions, 10 repetitions each, performed in supine, sitting, and standing positions).
- **Progression**: Increase contraction hold time and repetitions as endurance improves, guided by PERFECT scheme reassessments every 2 weeks.

### Core Stability Training
- **Protocol**: Supervised core stability exercises 2 times/week, 20 minutes/session, targeting Transversus abdominis and multifidus activation.
  - Exercises: Supine diaphragmatic breathing with pelvic floor co-activation (10 repetitions), Sahrmann Level 1 exercises (e.g., abdominal drawing-in maneuver, 10 repetitions/set, 2 sets).
  - Progress to Sahrmann Level 2 exercises (e.g., single-leg slides) as strength improves to Level 2/5.
- **Home Exercise Program**: Daily diaphragmatic breathing and Sahrmann Level 1 exercises (10 minutes/day).

### Lower Limb Strengthening
- **Protocol**: Supervised strengthening exercises 2 times/week, 20 minutes/session targeting hip flexors, gluteus medius, gluteus maximus, and obturator internus.
  - Exercises: Bridging (10 repetitions/set, 2 sets), side-lying hip abduction (10 repetitions/side, 2 sets), and seated hip flexion against resistance (10 repetitions/side, 2 sets).
  - Use of resistance bands to progress intensity as MMT scores improve.
- **Home Exercise Program**: Daily bridging and side-lying hip abduction (10 repetitions each, 1 set/day).

### Bladder Training
- **Protocol**: Implement a bladder training program based on Bladder Diary analysis, guided by a continence nurse.
  - Scheduled voiding every 2-3 hours during the day to reduce urgency and improve bladder capacity.
  - Gradual increase in voiding intervals by 15 minutes every 2 weeks, aiming for 3-4 hour intervals.
  - Urge suppression techniques: Pelvic floor muscle contraction and diaphragmatic breathing during urgency episodes.
- **Home Program**: Maintain a Bladder Diary to track voiding patterns, leakage episodes, and fluid intake (aim for 1.5-2 L/day, avoiding bladder irritants like caffeine).

### Education and Lifestyle Modifications
- **Education**: Provide patient education on pelvic floor anatomy, incontinence mechanisms, and the importance of adherence to PFMT and bladder training.
  - Use visual aids and ICIQ-MaleSF to track progress and motivate adherence.
- **Lifestyle Modifications**:
  - Fluid management: Limit fluid intake 2 hours before bedtime to reduce nocturia (target nocturnal urine volume <600 mL).
  - Weight management: Maintain current weight to avoid additional pressure on pelvic floor muscles.
  - Activity modification: Avoid heavy lifting or high-impact activities until pelvic floor strength improves.

### Adjunct Therapies
- **Electrical Stimulation**: If PFMT progress plateaus after 4 weeks, consider transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) to pelvic floor muscles (20 minutes/session, 2 times/week) to enhance muscle recruitment.
- **Cardiovascular Considerations**: Monitor blood pressure and heart rate during exercises due to history of Coronary Atherosclerotic Heart Disease and Hypertension. Avoid exercises causing significant Valsalva maneuver to minimize cardiovascular strain.

### Follow-up and Reassessment
-Schedule**: Weekly physiotherapy follow-ups for 8 weeks, with reassessments using ICIQ-MaleSF, PERFECT scheme, and Bladder Diary.
- **Adjustments**: Modify exercise intensity and bladder training intervals based on reassessment outcomes.
- **Referral**: If incontinence persists beyond 12 weeks, consider referral to a urologist for further evaluation (e.g., urodynamic studies or potential surgical options).
