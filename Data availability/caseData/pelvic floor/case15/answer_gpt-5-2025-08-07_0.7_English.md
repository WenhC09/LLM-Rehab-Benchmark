# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4–6 weeks):
- Improve pelvic floor muscle strength from Oxford grade 4/5 with endurance 3s → endurance ≥5s without compensatory muscle activation.
- Enhance abdominopelvic dissociation during pelvic floor muscle contractions, reducing compensatory activation of gluteal and abdominal muscles.
- Reduce urinary leakage episodes during positional changes, walking, coughing, and sneezing by ≥30% as recorded in bladder diary.
- Improve transversus abdominis activation from 1/5 to at least 2–3/5 on Sahrmann Core Stability Test.
- Optimize bladder habits to reduce nocturia frequency to ≤2–3 times/night.
- Improve sleep quality through symptom management.

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months):
- Achieve pelvic floor muscle strength and endurance sufficient for continence in daily activities (endurance ≥10s, coordinated contractions).
- Minimize or eliminate stress urinary incontinence during all physical activities, aiming for ≤1 pad/day or complete dryness.
- Restore functional core stability and hip muscle strength (MMT ≥4/5 in gluteus medius and obturator internus) to support pelvic stability.
- Enable full participation in social activities without external urinary collection device.
- Maintain optimal cardiovascular status during rehabilitation, with stable blood pressure and no cardiac events.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT)
- **Technique**: Patient education on correct contraction (lift and squeeze sensation), avoiding gluteal, thigh, and abdominal overactivation.
- **Dosage**:  
  - Slow contractions: 10 repetitions × 10 seconds hold with 10 seconds rest, 3 times/day.  
  - Quick contractions: 10 rapid squeezes after each set of slow contractions.
- **Position progression**: Supine → sitting → standing → functional activities.
- Use of **biofeedback** (EMG or ultrasound-guided) twice/week to ensure correct muscle recruitment and improve proprioception.

### B. Core Stability & Abdominopelvic Dissociation Training
- **Transversus abdominis activation**: Supine abdominal drawing-in maneuver, progressing to sitting and standing positions.
- Integrate with PFMT to develop combined core and pelvic floor activation.
- Sahrmann level 1–3 exercises, progressing gradually per tolerance.

### C. Hip and Pelvic Stabilizer Strengthening
- Target gluteus medius, gluteus maximus, obturator internus.
- Exercises: Side-lying hip abduction, bridging with pelvic floor co-contraction, clamshells.
- 3 sets × 10–12 repetitions, once/day.

### D. Bladder Training
- Scheduled voiding with gradual extension of intervals between voids.
- Urge suppression techniques: Rapid pelvic floor contractions when urgency occurs.
- Maintain bladder diary to monitor progress.

### E. Lifestyle & Behavioral Interventions
- Fluid management: Adequate hydration but avoid excessive evening fluid intake.
- Limit bladder irritants (caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods).
- Weight management if BMI elevated.

### F. Electrophysical Modalities
- **Electrical stimulation** of pelvic floor (intrarectal or surface) if voluntary contraction remains weak or coordination poor after initial training phase.
  - Frequency: 35–50 Hz, 250–300 μs pulse width, 15–20 min/session, 3 times/week.

### G. Education & Self-management
- Teach patient to perform pre-emptive pelvic floor contraction ("the Knack") before coughing, sneezing, or lifting.
- Posture correction and ergonomics to reduce intra-abdominal pressure spikes.

### H. Cardiovascular Monitoring
- Monitor heart rate and blood pressure before, during, and after exercise.
- Avoid Valsalva maneuver during exercises.
- Coordinate with cardiology for safe exercise prescription given CAD history.

### I. Sleep Hygiene Support
- Address nocturia triggers with bladder training and evening fluid management.
- Educate on relaxation techniques to improve sleep quality.

**Review schedule**: Reassess pelvic floor function, bladder diary, and muscle strength every 4 weeks; adjust program intensity and complexity accordingly.
