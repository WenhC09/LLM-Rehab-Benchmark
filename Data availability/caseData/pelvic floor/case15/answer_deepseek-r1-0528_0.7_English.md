# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (0-4 weeks):
- Reduce daily urinary leakage episodes by 50%
- Achieve independent pelvic floor muscle (PFM) contraction without accessory muscle compensation
- Improve PFM endurance to sustain contraction ≥5 seconds
- Normalize transversus abdominis activation (Sahrmann ≥3/5)
- Establish structured voiding schedule (every 2-3 hours)
- Reduce nocturia to ≤2 episodes/night

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve complete social continence (0-1 pad/day)
- Restore functional PFM strength (Oxford ≥4/5) with 10-second endurance
- Independent management of urgency symptoms
- Resume all pre-surgery activities without urinary containment devices
- Optimize gluteal strength (MMT ≥4+/5 bilaterally)

## 2. Treatment Methods
### Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation
- **Biofeedback-assisted PFMT**: 3x/day progressive protocol  
  (Week 1: 5x5-sec holds; Week 2: 10x5-sec; Week 3: 10x7-sec with 10-sec rest)
- **Electrical Stimulation**: Bipolar anal plug stimulation  
  Parameters: 50Hz, 300μs pulse, 5s on/10s off, 20min/session (2x/day)
- **Urge Suppression Techniques**:  
  - Quick flick contractions during urgency  
  - Distraction strategies  
  - Scheduled voiding protocol (initially 2-hour intervals)

### Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation
- **Core Stabilization Training**:  
  - Sahrmann progression (Level 1-3)  
  - Abdominal drawing-in maneuvers in hook-lying  
- **Hip Strengthening**:  
  - Gluteus medius: Side-lying leg raises (3x15 reps)  
  - Gluteus maximus: Bridge progressions (3x10 reps)  
- **Postural Re-education**:  
  - Sitting posture correction  
  - Gait training with pelvic alignment

### Behavioral Modifications
- **Fluid Management**:  
  - 1500mL/day structured intake  
  - Evening fluid restriction (400mL after 7PM)  
- **Bladder Diary Implementation**:  
  - Real-time documentation for pattern analysis  
- **Lifestyle Adaptation**:  
  - Cough/sneeze pre-contraction technique  
  - Sleep hygiene optimization

### Cardiopulmonary Integration
- **Aerobic Conditioning**:  
  - Daily walking program (start 10min 2x/day, increase 5min/week)  
  - Continuous BP/HR monitoring during exercise  
- **Breathing-Retraining**:  
  - Diaphragmatic breathing exercises (5min 3x/day)  
  - Integrated PFM activation with expiration

### Monitoring Parameters
- Weekly PERFECT reassessment  
- Biweekly ICIQ-MaleSF administration  
- Daily bladder diary review  
- Monthly urodynamic re-evaluation  
- Cardiac symptom log during exercise
