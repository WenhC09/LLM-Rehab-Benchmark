# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4-6 weeks):

*   **Pelvic Floor Muscle Function**:
    *   Achieve correct, isolated pelvic floor muscle (PFM) contraction without compensatory activation of gluteal or abdominal muscles.
    *   Increase PFM endurance from 3 seconds to 6 seconds per contraction.
    *   Increase PFM repetitions to 8-10 consecutive, quality contractions per set.
*   **Continence**:
    *   Reduce urinary leakage episodes by 50% during walking and minor positional changes, as measured by a bladder diary and pad-weight test.
    *   Master the technique of pre-contracting the PFM ("The Knack") before coughing or sneezing.
*   **Core Stability**:
    *   Improve Transversus abdominis strength from grade 1/5 to 2/5 (Sahrmann Core Stability Test).
*   **Behavioral/Educational**:
    *   Patient will demonstrate understanding of fluid management strategies to reduce nocturia.
    *   Patient will adhere to a timed voiding schedule of every 2 hours during waking hours to manage urgency.

### Long-term goals (within 3-6 months):

*   **Pelvic Floor Muscle Function**:
    *   Achieve PFM endurance of 10 seconds per contraction.
    *   Achieve Oxford Muscle Strength Scale grade 5/5 for PFM.
*   **Continence**:
    *   Achieve social continence, defined as requiring no more than one security pad per day for confidence, with minimal to no leakage.
    *   Eliminate the need for an external urinary collection device for community activities.
    *   Demonstrate automatic use of "The Knack" during functional activities (e.g., lifting, standing from a chair).
*   **Core Stability & Functional Strength**:
    *   Improve Transversus abdominis strength to grade 4/5 or higher.
    *   Improve strength of hip stabilizers (Gluteus medius, Gluteus maximus, Obturator internus) to at least grade 4/5.
*   **Quality of Life**:
    *   Reduce nocturia to 0-1 episodes per night.
    *   Report improved sleep quality and confidence in social situations, reflected by a significant decrease in the ICIQ-MaleSF score.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Patient Education

1.  **Anatomy and Pathophysiology**: Provide a clear explanation of the post-prostatectomy changes to the urinary system, emphasizing the loss of the internal urethral sphincter and the new, critical role of the external urethral sphincter and pelvic floor muscles for maintaining continence.
2.  **Fluid Management**: Advise on maintaining adequate hydration (approx. 1.5-2L/day) while limiting bladder irritants (e.g., caffeine, alcohol). Recommend reducing fluid intake 2-3 hours before bedtime to address nocturia.
3.  **Bladder Training**: Initiate a timed voiding schedule based on the bladder diary. Start with voiding every 2 hours during the day, regardless of urge. Teach urge suppression techniques (e.g., sitting down, performing several PFM contractions) to gradually increase the interval between voids.

### B. Neuromuscular Re-education and Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT)

1.  **Isolation and Coordination Training**:
    *   Initial focus on dissociating PFM contraction from abdominal, gluteal, and adductor muscles. Utilize tactile cues (patient placing a hand on the perineum) and verbal cues ("shorten the penis," "lift the testicles") to achieve correct activation.
    *   **EMG Biofeedback**: Use surface EMG with perianal sensors to provide direct visual and auditory feedback. Set goals to increase activity in PFM channels while keeping abdominal and gluteal channel activity low. This is critical to correct the observed poor synergy.
    *   **Real-time Ultrasound Biofeedback**: Use transabdominal ultrasound to visualize the bladder base lift during a correct PFM contraction, reinforcing proper technique and co-activation of the deep Transversus abdominis.

2.  **Therapeutic Exercise Prescription**:
    *   **Endurance (Type I fibers)**: Start with 3-second holds, 10 repetitions, 3 sets per day. Gradually progress hold time towards the 10-second goal as endurance improves. Ensure full relaxation between contractions.
    *   **Strength (Type II fibers)**: Perform 10 maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs), holding for 1-2 seconds each, 3 sets per day.
    *   **Fast Contractions ("The Knack")**: Perform 10 rapid, strong PFM contractions in succession to train for reflexive closure during sudden increases in intra-abdominal pressure. Practice integrating this before a voluntary cough, sneeze, or change in position.

### C. Lumbopelvic and Core Stabilization Training

1.  **Transversus Abdominis (TrA) Activation**: Begin with supine abdominal drawing-in maneuvers, focusing on gentle, deep abdominal tightening without breath-holding or pelvic tilting. Progress through the Sahrmann Core Stability levels as control improves.
2.  **Hip Stabilizer Strengthening**:
    *   **Gluteus Medius**: Clamshells, side-lying hip abduction.
    *   **Gluteus Maximus**: Supine bridging.
    *   **Obturator Internus**: Seated or side-lying hip external rotation against light resistance.
    *   Emphasis will be on proper form and avoiding substitution, ensuring these exercises support the pelvic floor rather than overpowering it.

### D. Modalities

1.  **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**:
    *   Given the absent bulbocavernosus reflex, NMES via an intra-anal probe or surface perineal electrodes will be used.
    *   This will serve to improve sensory awareness (proprioception) of the PFM, facilitate active muscle contraction, and provide passive strengthening to prevent disuse atrophy while voluntary control is being optimized. A program alternating between endurance (low frequency) and strength (higher frequency) protocols will be implemented.

### E. Home Exercise Program (HEP)

1.  Provide a structured, written program with clear illustrations and frequency/duration instructions.
2.  The program will include PFM exercises, core stabilization exercises, and behavioral strategies.
3.  The patient will continue the bladder diary for 2 weeks to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Regular review and progression of the HEP will occur at each follow-up appointment.
