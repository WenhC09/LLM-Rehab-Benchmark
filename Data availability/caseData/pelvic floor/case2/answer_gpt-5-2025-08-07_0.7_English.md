# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4–6 weeks):
- Relieve constipation symptoms by improving defecation coordination.
- Reduce puborectalis muscle resting hypertonicity and paradoxical contraction during straining.
- Improve anal sphincter relaxation capacity and rectal propulsion during simulated defecation.
- Establish regular bowel habits and reduce dependence on enemas/laxatives.
- Decrease anxiety symptoms to facilitate pelvic floor muscle relaxation.
- Educate patient on proper defecation posture, breathing techniques, and dietary adjustments.

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months):
- Achieve regular, spontaneous bowel movements (≥3/week) with minimal straining (Bristol Stool Form Scale type 3–4).
- Normalize anorectal coordination and improve balloon expulsion performance.
- Maintain improved pelvic floor muscle tone and function without recurrence of anismus symptoms.
- Sustain anxiety control and enhance coping strategies for stress.
- Improve quality of life, reduce Wexner Constipation Score by ≥50%, and maintain stable mood.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Pelvic Floor Biofeedback Therapy
- **Frequency:** 2–3 sessions/week, 30–40 minutes per session.
- **Method:** Use anorectal manometry or surface EMG-guided biofeedback to train relaxation of puborectalis and external anal sphincter during simulated defecation.
- **Focus:** Visual and auditory feedback to teach voluntary relaxation at straining, coordination of abdominal push with pelvic floor relaxation.
- **Progression:** Gradually increase training difficulty, incorporate balloon expulsion training with graduated volumes.

### B. Pelvic Floor Muscle Relaxation Training
- **Techniques:** Diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery.
- **Daily practice:** 10–15 minutes, 2–3 times/day.
- **Integration:** Combine with warm sitz baths (10–15 minutes) before defecation attempts to promote sphincter relaxation.

### C. Defecation Posture & Behavioral Training
- **Posture:** Use footstool to elevate knees above hips, lean forward to straighten anorectal angle.
- **Timing:** Attempt defecation at regular times, preferably after meals (gastrocolic reflex).
- **Straining:** Avoid prolonged straining; limit to ≤5 minutes per attempt.

### D. Dietary & Bowel Habit Modification
- **Diet:** High-fiber intake (25–30 g/day) from vegetables, fruits, whole grains; adequate hydration (1500–2000 mL/day unless contraindicated).
- **Avoid:** Excess caffeine, alcohol, constipating foods.
- **Gradual fiber increase:** To avoid bloating and discomfort.

### E. Psychological Intervention
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Address anxiety and maladaptive defecation-related thoughts.
- **Relaxation skills:** Incorporate mindfulness and stress management techniques.
- **Referral:** Coordinate with psychiatry/psychology for medication review and supportive therapy as needed.

### F. Neuromodulation (if biofeedback insufficient after 8–12 weeks)
- **Transanal electrical stimulation:** Low-frequency stimulation to promote sphincter relaxation and improve rectal sensation thresholds.
- **Frequency:** 2–3 times/week, 20 minutes/session.

### G. Home Exercise Program
- Daily pelvic floor relaxation exercises.
- Abdominal wall strengthening and gentle core stability exercises to assist rectal propulsion without overactivating pelvic floor.

### H. Education & Self-Management
- Provide written and verbal instructions on bowel management.
- Teach self-monitoring of stool form, frequency, and defecation effort.
- Encourage adherence to therapy and lifestyle changes.

### I. Follow-up & Re-evaluation
- Reassess symptoms, Wexner score, and Bristol Stool Form every 4 weeks.
- Repeat anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion test after 3 months to evaluate physiological improvement.
- Adjust treatment plan based on progress and patient feedback.
