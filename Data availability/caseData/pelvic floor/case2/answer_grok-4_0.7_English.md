# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals:
- Improve bowel movement frequency to at least 3 times per week within 4–6 weeks.
- Reduce Wexner Constipation Score by 5–7 points within 6 weeks.
- Decrease anal tenesmus and pain during defecation within 4 weeks.
- Enhance pelvic floor muscle coordination and relaxation during defecation within 8 weeks.
- Reduce anxiety symptoms (Hamilton Anxiety Scale) to mild or lower within 6 weeks.

### Long-term Goals:
- Achieve regular, spontaneous bowel movements (Bristol Stool Form Scale Type 3–4) at least 4–5 times per week within 3–6 months.
- Normalize pelvic floor muscle function, including complete anal sphincter relaxation during defecation, within 6 months.
- Maintain Wexner Constipation Score below 10 points within 6 months.
- Sustain improved mental health with minimal or no anxiety symptoms and stable mood within 6–12 months.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy
- **Biofeedback Training (4–6 weeks, 2 sessions/week):**
  - Utilize anorectal manometry-based biofeedback to improve pelvic floor muscle coordination. Focus on training the patient to relax the anal sphincter and puborectalis muscle during simulated defecation, addressing paradoxical contraction observed in defecography and manometry.
  - Goal: Achieve voluntary relaxation of pelvic floor muscles during straining, confirmed by improved balloon expulsion test results.
- **Pelvic Floor Muscle Exercises (Daily, 10–15 minutes):**
  - Teach diaphragmatic breathing combined with progressive relaxation techniques to reduce pubctalis hypertonicity.
  - Incorporate Kegel exercises to strengthen weak anal sphincter tone, progressing to coordinated relaxation exercises to prevent paradoxical contraction.
  - Home exercise program with guided instructions to ensure compliance.

### B. Bowel Management Program
- **Dietary Modification:**
 Increase dietary fiber intake to 25–30 g/day (e.g whole grains, fruits, vegetables) to soften stool consistency (targeting Bristol Stool Form Scale Type 3–4).
  - Ensure adequate hydration (2–2.5 L/day of water) to prevent dry, hard stools.
  - Avoid constipating foods (e.g., processed foods, low-fiber diets).
  - Consult a dietitian to create a personalized meal plan and monitor adherence.
- **Bowel Training Regimen (Daily):**
  - Schedule regular toilet time (e.g., 15–20 minutes post-meal) to leverage gastrocolic reflex and promote regular bowel habits.
  - Use a squatting position or footstool during defecation to optimize anorectal angle (based defecography findings of 119° during straining).
- **Laxative Therapy (As prescribed by gastroenterologist):**
  - Continue osmotic laxatives (e.g., polyethylene glycol) to soften stool and reduce straining, tapering as bowel habits improve.
  - Avoid stimulant laxatives (e., senna, rhubarb) to prevent dependency.

### C. Psychological Intervention
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) (1 session/week for 8–12 weeks):**
  - Address moderate anxiety and mild depression (per Hamilton Scale) through CBT to reduce stress-related exacerbation of pelvic floor dysfunction and constipation.
  - Focus on strategies for work-related stress and to manage low mood, improving overall mental health and defecation-related anxiety.
- **Relaxation Techniques (Daily, 10–15 minutes):**
  - Implement progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness meditation to reduce sympathetic excitability (noted in Pudendal SSR) and promote pelvic floor relaxation.
  - Provide guided audio resources for home practice.

### D. Neuromuscular Rehabilitation
- **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) (2 sessions/week for 6 weeks):**
  - Apply NMES to the pelvic floor to address neurogenic damage and incomplete relaxation of the urethral and anal sphincters (per neurophysiological findings).
  - Use-frequency stimulation to enhance muscle re-education and coordination.
- **Pelvic Floor Ultrasound-Guided Therapy (1 session/week for 8 weeks):**
  - Use real-time ultrasound feedback to monitor and correct paradoxical puborectalis muscle contraction post-Valsalva maneuver.
  - Guide in achieving appropriate muscle relaxation during straining.

### E. Monitoring and Follow-Up
- **Weekly Assessments (First 6 weeks):**
  - Monitor bowel movement frequency, stool consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale), and Wexner Constipation Score.
  - Reassess pelvic floor coordination via biofeedback and balloon expulsion test.
- **Monthly Follow-Ups (Months 2–6):**
  - Repeat anorectal man and pelvic floor ultrasound to evaluate sphincter relaxation and puborectalis function.
  - Reassess Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale to track psychological progress.
- **Multidisciplinary Collaboration:**
  - Coordinate with gastroenterologist for laxative adjustments and dietary oversight.
  - Consult psychiatrist for ongoing management of anxiety disorder, ensuring medication compliance and psychological therapy alignment.

### F. Patient Education
- Educate on the relationship between pelvic floor dysfunction, chronic constipation, and anxiety to improve treatment adherence.
- Provide written and verbal instructions for home exercises, bowel training, and relaxation techniques.
- Encourage journaling of bowel movements, diet, and stress levels to identify triggers and monitor.
