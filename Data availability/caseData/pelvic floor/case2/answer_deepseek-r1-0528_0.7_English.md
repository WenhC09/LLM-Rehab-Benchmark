# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (4-8 weeks):
- Reduce Wexner Constipation Score by 30% (from 21 to ≤15)
- Achieve Bristol Stool Scale Type 3-4 consistency
- Establish successful balloon expulsion within 3 minutes
- Reduce anal tenesmus and pain during defecation by 50%
- Demonstrate correct pelvic floor relaxation technique during simulated defecation
- Improve diaphragmatic breathing pattern during straining efforts

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Maintain Wexner Score ≤10 with spontaneous defecation
- Eliminate dependency on enemas/laxatives
- Restore normal puborectalis coordination (EMG-confirmed relaxation during straining)
- Normalize sympathetic skin response parameters
- Achieve 30% reduction in anxiety/depression scale scores
- Establish sustainable bowel management routine

## 2. Treatment Methods

### I. Biofeedback Therapy (Core Intervention)
- **EMG Biofeedback**: 3 sessions/week  
  - Real-time visual feedback for puborectalis re-education  
  - Paradoxical contraction correction protocol: Resting baseline → Contraction → Controlled relaxation  
  - Threshold-based training for anal sphincter relaxation during simulated defecation  
- **Defecation Dynamics Retraining**:  
  - Balloon expulsion training with pressure-sensor guidance  
  - Postural adjustment training (lean-forward position)  

### II. Pelvic Floor Muscle Rehabilitation
- **Manual Therapy**:  
  - Internal myofascial release for puborectalis trigger points (2x/week)  
  - Transperineal ultrasound-guided stretching  
- **Muscle Re-education Protocol**:  
  - Reverse Kegel exercises: 5 sets/day (10-sec relaxation holds)  
  - Diaphragmatic breathing-synchronized pelvic floor drops  
  - Graded straining desensitization program  

### III. Neuromodulation
- **Pudendal Nerve Retraining**:  
  - Sympathetic skin response (SSR) biofeedback  
  - Transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (TTNS) protocol  
- **Sensory Re-education**:  
  - Rectal sensory training using graded balloon distension  
  - Urge perception training with standardized volumes  

### IV. Bowel Management Program
- **Scheduled Defecation Protocol**:  
  - Post-prandial toilet sitting (15 min after breakfast)  
  - Footstool-assisted squatting position training  
- **Stool Modification**:  
  - Osmotic agent (Polyethylene glycol) titration protocol  
  - Fiber supplementation regimen with close monitoring  
- **Abdominal Support**:  
  - Diastasis recti screening with core stabilization exercises  

### V. Behavioral-Psychological Intervention
- **Defecation Behavior Modification**:  
  - Valsalva avoidance training  
  - Strain-free evacuation technique education  
- **Anxiety Management**:  
  - Diaphragmatic breathing exercises (10 min, 3x/day)  
  - Progressive muscle relaxation protocol  
  - Collaboration with psychiatry for medication optimization  

### VI. Education & Self-Management
- **Defecation Diary**: Digital tracking of stool type/frequency/pain  
- **Hydration/Nutrition Plan**: Minimum 2L water + soluble fiber targets  
- **Workplace Ergonomics**: Stress reduction strategies and posture modification  
- **Partner Education**: Joint sessions for home program adherence
