# 1. Rehabilitation Goals:

## Short-Term Goals:
*   Correct abnormal defecation patterns and establish proper abdominal-pelvic floor muscle coordination.
*   Improve posture, specifically addressing anterior pelvic tilt and thoracolumbar curvature abnormalities.
*   Alleviate and eliminate trigger points in pelvic floor and peri-hip muscles, including the puborectalis and obturator internus.
*   Release tension in tight peri-hip muscles (e.g., gluteus maximus, hip adductors, hip flexors) to restore normal hip joint range of motion in flexion, adduction, and abduction.
*   Strengthen weak core muscles (abdominal muscles) and pelvic floor muscles.
*   Modify thoracic-dominant breathing pattern and establish correct diaphragmatic breathing.
*   Enhance the patient's ability to perceive stool in the rectum.

## Long-Term Goals:
*   Significantly improve symptoms of difficult defecation, reduce the Wexner Constipation Score, and achieve regular, unobstructed spontaneous bowel movements.
*   Eliminate dependence on auxiliary defecation methods such as glycerin enemas ("Kaisailu").
*   Eliminate the patient's fear of constipation and alleviate associated anxiety and depression by understanding the physiology of defecation and mastering correct defecation techniques.
*   Establish healthy lifestyle and bowel habits to prevent constipation recurrence.

# 2. Treatment Methods:

Following botulinum toxin injection, an 8-week comprehensive rehabilitation program (3 sessions per week) was implemented to address persistent defecation pattern abnormalities, muscle weakness, and musculoskeletal imbalances. Details are as follows:

*   **Patient Education & Behavioral Management**
    *   **Cognitive Restructuring:** Explain that daily bowel movements are not an absolute health standard to reduce psychological burden and laxative dependence.
    *   **Dietary Guidance:** Recommend increased fluid intake (target: 3.7 liters/day) and dietary fiber intake (target: 20-35 grams/day), suggesting high-fiber foods like raw wheat bran.
    *   **Behavioral Training:** Instruct the patient to utilize the postprandial period (especially after breakfast), when colonic motility is highest, for attempted defecation. Teach the correct toileting posture: squatting or sitting with feet placed on a footstool so knees are higher than hips to straighten the anorectal angle and reduce defecation resistance.
    *   **Defecation Sensation & Coordination Training:** Guide the patient to understand and practice correct defecation mechanics, e.g., using balloon simulation or therapist-guided digital rectal stimulation to improve pelvic floor muscle coordination.

*   **Electromyographic Biofeedback Therapy**
    *   Utilize EMG biofeedback equipment to provide visual/auditory cues, enabling the patient to perceive pelvic floor muscle contraction and relaxation states. Aims to enhance rectal sensation and specifically train pelvic floor muscle strength, coordination, and control, correcting paradoxical contraction during defecation.

*   **Manual Therapy & Myofascial Release**
    *   **Myofascial Release:** Release tension in the thoracolumbar fascia and peri-hip fasciae, and address trigger points within the puborectalis to improve the overall biomechanical environment.
    *   **Coccyx Mobilization & Pelvic Floor Muscle Relaxation:** With the patient in left lateral decubitus position, the therapist inserts a gloved finger into the rectum to locate the coccyx and performs gentle massage along the puborectalis. Guide the patient in alternating Kegel exercises (contraction/relaxation). During simulated defecation, the therapist gently pulls the coccyx posteriorly to facilitate coccyx extension and pelvic floor relaxation, coordinated with lower abdominal contraction to maintain intra-abdominal pressure.
    *   **Muscle Energy Techniques (MET):** Used to improve restricted hip joint range of motion.
        *   **Hip Adductor Release:** Patient supine, knees bent, heels together. Therapist passively abducts hips to the point of tissue tension. Patient is instructed to resist the therapist's adduction force with 10%-20% effort for 10 seconds, then relaxes. Therapist then passively moves the hip into greater abduction.
        *   **Hip Flexor Release:** Patient supine near the edge of the treatment table, one leg flexed at hip and knee held to chest. The contralateral leg hangs freely off the table. Therapist stabilizes the pelvis and applies downward resistance proximal to the knee of the hanging leg. Patient uses minimal force to resist upwards for 10 seconds, then relaxes. Therapist then passively moves the hip into greater extension.
    *   **Spinal Manipulative Therapy:** Apply manual techniques to the T9-L2 spinal segments. Aim to modulate autonomic nervous system function, inhibiting sympathetic overactivity to improve intestinal motility and defecation.

*   **Exercise Training**
    *   **Core & Abdominal Strengthening:** Perform core functional exercises (e.g., kneeling plank, glute bridge, cat-cow stretch, dead bug exercise, beetle exercise) to strengthen abdominal muscles. Goal: Generate and maintain stable intra-abdominal pressure during defecation and restore the recto-abdominal reflex.
    *   **Breathing Pattern Retraining:** Correct thoracic-dominant breathing and instruct in diaphragmatic breathing to improve diaphragmatic excursion.
    *   **Spinal & Hip Joint Mobility Training:** Combine with core training to increase overall spinal and hip flexibility, improving biomechanical abnormalities caused by poor posture.

*   **Abdominal Massage**
    *   Instruct patient in self-administered abdominal colonic massage to stimulate peristalsis. Technique: Using 2-3 fingers, start in the right lower quadrant (origin of ascending colon), apply small clockwise circular motions moving upwards along the ascending colon, across the abdomen (transverse colon), then downwards along the descending colon to the left lower quadrant. Duration: 1 minute per session, repeated 10 times daily.
