*   **Present Illness:** The patient experienced difficult defecation without obvious precipitating factors several years ago. Each bowel movement exceeded 30 minutes, with irregular frequency (longest interval being once per week). Self-medication with "senna leaves, rhubarb" provided slight relief. Over the past six months, difficulty defecating worsened, accompanied by anal tenesmus and pain. Enemas were required for each bowel movement. Stool was dry, black, and hard in consistency. No abdominal distension, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, belching, or acid reflux reported. Presented to our hospital for further management of defecation issues. Since onset, the patient has been conscious, in fair spirits (with occasional low mood), with fair appetite and sleep. Difficult defecation persists. Urination is normal. No significant weight loss.
*   **Past Medical History:** Diagnosed with anxiety disorder one year ago, improved with medication. No history of smoking or alcohol consumption. Reports high work-related stress.
*   **Family History:** Denies family history of genetic diseases or similar conditions. Wife has depression.

### (B) Physical Examination & Functional Assessment
*   **Physical Examination:** Temperature 36.1째C, Pulse 81 bpm, Respiration 20 bpm, Blood Pressure 127/80 mmHg. Body Mass Index (BMI) 19.26, thin build, weak voice. Abdomen soft and flat. Tenderness above pubic symphysis. Perianal area dry with skin tags, no skin lesions or eczema. Digital rectal examination revealed no tumor. Poor anal sphincter tone. Failure of perianal muscles to relax during simulated defecation. No blood on glove upon withdrawal.
*   **Functional Assessment (Quantitative Examinations):**
    *   **Bristol Stool Form Scale:** Type 1 or 2.
    *   **Wexner Constipation Score:** 21 points.
    *   **Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale:** Moderate anxiety, mild depression.

### (C) Auxiliary Examinations (Quantitative & Qualitative)
*   **Defecography (X-ray):** Puborectalis angle: 96째 (resting), 104째 (sitting), 119째 (straining). No significant rectocele or mucosal prolapse observed during straining.
*   **Anorectal Manometry:** Slightly insufficient rectal propulsion. Incomplete relaxation of the anal sphincter during defecation. Slightly low thresholds for urge to defecate and maximum tolerable volume. Anorectal inhibitory reflex present. Cough reflex present. Balloon expulsion test (16 F catheter) failed within 5 minutes.
*   **Neurophysiological Examination:** Abnormal Dorsal Penile Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEP). Abnormal Anal SEP. Low sympathetic excitability on Pudendal Sympathetic Skin Response (SSR). Resting hypertonicity observed in puborectalis muscle, with paradoxical contraction during straining. Neurogenic damage of urethral sphincter with incomplete relaxation during straining. Normal bulbocavernosus reflex.
*   **Pelvic Floor Ultrasound:** Puborectalis muscle elasticity showed paradoxical increase post-Valsalva maneuver.
