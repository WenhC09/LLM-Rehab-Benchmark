# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4-8 weeks):
- Reduce pelvic pain and lumbosacral soreness (target VAS score ≤3).
- Improve pelvic floor muscle awareness and initiate voluntary contraction (Oxford Muscle Strength Scale ≥1).
- Decrease urinary leakage frequency during coughing/sneezing by 50%.
- Improve bowel movement regularity (target 1-2 times/day with reduced incomplete evacuation sensation).
- Enhance proprioception in the pelvic region (improve Nine-Square Grid Test accuracy by 50%).
- Correct leg length discrepancy and pelvic tilt to improve postural symmetry.

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve full resolution of stress urinary incontinence (no leakage during coughing/sneezing).
- Eliminate pelvic and lumbosacral pain (VAS score 0).
- Restore pelvic floor muscle strength to Oxford Grade 3-4 for functional support.
- Normalize bowel movements (1-2 times/day, no incomplete evacuation sensation).
- Correct anterior and posterior vaginal wall prolapse to Grade 0 or minimal residual prolapse.
- Achieve symmetrical pelvic alignment and full range of motion in hip and lumbar regions.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT)
- **Biofeedback Therapy**: Use electromyography (EMG)-guided biofeedback to train pelvic floor muscle awareness and contraction. Sessions: 3 times/week, 20 minutes/session for 8 weeks. Focus on isolating levator ani and avoiding compensatory thoracic/abdominal muscle use.
- **Kegel Exercises**: Teach patient to perform slow and fast pelvic floor contractions (10 slow contractions held for 5 seconds, followed by 10 quick contractions, 3 sets/day). Emphasize proper technique with verbal and tactile cues to avoid Valsalva maneuver.
- **Proprioceptive Retraining**: Use Nine-Square Grid Test feedback to improve sensory awareness. Perform 10-minute sessions, 2 times/week, with a cotton swab to stimulate specific pelvic points and guide patient to identify locations accurately.

### B. Pain Management
- **Manual Therapy**: Soft tissue mobilization targeting hypertonic pelvic floor muscles (levator ani, obturator internus, iliococcygeus). Perform 15-minute sessions, 2 times/week for 6 weeks, focusing on reducing palpable cords and tenderness.
- **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)**: Apply TENS to lumbosacral and pelvic regions to reduce pain (VAS score reduction). Settings: 100 Hz, 15-minute sessions, 3 times/week for 4 weeks.
- **Heat Therapy**: Apply moist heat packs to lumbosacral area for 15 minutes/day to relieve soreness and promote muscle relaxation.

### C. Postural and Structural Correction
- **Myofascial Release**: Target asymmetrical pubic symphysis, sacrum, and costal arch asymmetry. Perform 20-minute sessions, 2 times/week for 8 weeks, to release tension in the left diaphragm and pelvic ligaments.
- **Therapeutic Exercises**:
  - **Bridging Exercises**: To strengthen gluteal muscles and correct pelvic tilt (3 sets of 10 reps, 2 times/day).
  - **Cat-Cow Stretch**: To improve lumbar mobility and reduce excessive lordosis (2 sets of 10 reps, 2 times/day).
  - **Hip Mobility Exercises**: Focus on left hip internal/external rotation and right hip external rotation (10 reps/side, 2 times/day).
- **Orthotic Intervention**: Prescribe a heel lift for the right leg (to address left leg length discrepancy) to promote symmetrical weight-bearing. Monitor alignment weekly for adjustments.

### D. Bladder and Bowel Retraining
- **Bladder Training**: Implement a scheduled voiding program (every 1-2 hours, gradually increasing intervals by 15 minutes/week) to improve bladder capacity and reduce urgency/frequency. Target voided volume ≥200 mL.
- **Bowel Management**: Encourage high-fiber diet (25-30 g/day) and adequate hydration (1.5-2 L/day). Teach diaphragmatic breathing during defecation to reduce straining and incomplete evacuation. Use a stool diary to monitor progress.
- **Pelvic Floor Relaxation Techniques**: Train patient in reverse Kegel exercises (pelvic floor relaxation) to reduce perianal tension and improve defecation ease (10 reps, 2 times/day).

### E. Education and Lifestyle Modifications
- **Patient Education**: Provide counseling on pelvic floor anatomy, incontinence triggers, and proper posture during daily activities. Use visual aids to reinforce pelvic floor muscle training techniques.
- **Weight Management**: Refer to a nutritionist for a tailored plan to address overweight habitus, as excess weight exacerbates prolapse and incontinence.
- **Sleep Hygiene**: Recommend relaxation techniques (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation, 10 minutes before bed) to address difficulty initiating sleep and improve overall recovery.

### F. Monitoring and Follow-Up
- **Weekly Assessments**: Monitor VAS score, pelvic floor muscle strength (Oxford Scale), and Nine-Square Grid Test performance to track progress.
- **Monthly Re-evaluations**: Repeat physical exam to assess vaginal wall prolapse, pelvic tilt, and hip mobility. Adjust treatment intensity based on progress.
- **Pelvic MRI Follow-Up**: Schedule a repeat MRI at 3 months to evaluate changes in uterine position, pelvic fluid, and mesentery descent.

### G. Precautions
- Avoid high-impact activities (e.g., running, jumping) to prevent worsening of prolapse or incontinence.
- Monitor for signs of overtraining (e.g., increased pelvic pain or muscle fatigue) during PFMT and adjust intensity accordingly.
- Ensure proper hydration to prevent constipation, which could exacerbate pelvic floor strain.
