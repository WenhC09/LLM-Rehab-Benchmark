# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Reduce lumbosacral pain to a VAS score of 3 or lower within 4 weeks.
- Improve pelvic floor muscle strength to at least Grade 1 on the Oxford Muscle Strength Scale within 6 weeks.
- Decrease urinary frequency to less than 8 times per day and increase urine volume to over 200 mL per void within 4 weeks.
- Enhance proprioception and positional sense within the pelvic region, aiming for improved performance on the 9-grid proprioception test within 6 weeks.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve full functional recovery of pelvic floor muscle strength (Grade 3 or higher) within 12 weeks.
- Resolve stress urinary incontinence symptoms, aiming for no leakage during coughing or sneezing within 12 weeks.
- Correct pelvic tilt and improve postural alignment, achieving symmetrical iliac crests and gluteal folds within 12 weeks.
- Establish a regular bowel pattern with no sensation of incomplete evacuation within 12 weeks.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### A. Physical Therapy:
- **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training**: Initiate biofeedback-assisted pelvic floor muscle exercises to promote muscle awareness and contraction. Gradually progress to strengthening exercises as tolerated.
- **Manual Therapy**: Implement myofascial release techniques targeting the levator ani and surrounding musculature to reduce tension and improve mobility.
- **Postural Training**: Educate the patient on proper posture and alignment to address pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis. Incorporate exercises to strengthen core stabilizers.

### B. Pain Management:
- **Therapeutic Modalities**: Utilize modalities such as heat therapy, TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation), and ultrasound to manage lumbosacral pain and promote tissue healing.
- **Medication**: Consider a trial of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain management, if not contraindicated.

### C. Behavioral Interventions:
- **Bladder Training**: Implement a bladder training program to gradually increase intervals between voiding and improve bladder capacity.
- **Dietary Modifications**: Advise on dietary changes to promote regular bowel movements and reduce abdominal distension, including increased fiber intake and hydration.

### D. Education and Support:
- **Patient Education**: Provide education on the anatomy and function of the pelvic floor, the importance of pelvic health, and strategies for managing urinary incontinence.
- **Support Groups**: Encourage participation in support groups for individuals with similar conditions to foster emotional support and coping strategies.

### E. Follow-Up and Reassessment:
- Schedule follow-up assessments every 2 weeks to monitor progress towards rehabilitation goals and adjust the treatment plan as necessary based on the patient's response to therapy.
