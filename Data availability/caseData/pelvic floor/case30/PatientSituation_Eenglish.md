# Case Information and Pre-Rehabilitation Examination

## I. Case Summary

### (I) History of Present Illness

*   **Demographics**: Female patient, 41 years old.
*   **Chief Complaint**: Urinary leakage during coughing and sneezing accompanied by lumbosacral pain for 8 years, aggravated with pelvic pain for 1 month.
*   **Present Illness**: The patient developed urinary leakage during coughing and sneezing following an "external hemorrhoidectomy" 8 years ago, occasionally accompanied by urinary urgency, frequency, small voided volume, and thinning of the urinary stream. Subsequently, lumbosacral pain gradually appeared, primarily characterized by soreness and distension, without limb numbness. Lumbar spine anteroposterior and lateral radiographs showed no abnormalities. Symptoms slightly improved after massage and physical therapy, but pain recurred intermittently. One month ago, increased coughing due to a cold led to significantly increased frequency and volume of urinary leakage. Lumbar pain also radiated to the vulva and buttocks, presenting as a dragging, distending sensation. Admitted to the hospital with a provisional diagnosis of "Pelvic Pain with Stress Urinary Incontinence." Since onset, the patient has been conscious, with fair mental status, occasional low mood, fair appetite, and poor sleep (difficulty initiating sleep). Defecation difficulties worsened, with a sensation of incomplete evacuation, increased daily frequency and duration of toilet sitting, and a subjective feeling of perianal distension and a foreign body sensation. Urinary symptoms as described above. No significant weight loss.
*   **Past Medical History**: Underwent "external hemorrhoidectomy" 8 years ago.

### (II) Physical Examination

*   **General Examination**: Temperature 36.1°C, Pulse 75 bpm, Respiration 20/min, Blood Pressure 105/67 mmHg. Conscious, overweight body habitus, ambulatory. Clear breath sounds bilaterally, no dry or moist rales. Cardiac and abdominal examinations revealed no significant abnormalities.
*   **Specialized Examination**: Asymmetry of bilateral costal arches, with slight flaring of the left costal arch. Left diaphragmatic tension. Abdominal distension with flaccid abdominal wall. Asymmetry at the pubic symphysis. Tenderness over the left pyramidalis muscle. Good vulvar closure. Valsalva maneuver revealed Grade II anterior vaginal wall prolapse and Grade I posterior vaginal wall prolapse. Asymmetric urethrovesical groove (left wider, right narrower). Increased posterior vesical angle. Uterus deviated to the right, with the cervical os retroverted towards the posterior vaginal fornix and impacted anterior to the sacrum; restricted uterine mobility. Bilateral obturator internus, iliococcygeus, ischiococcygeus, and levator ani arcus tendineus muscles showed palpable cords, abnormal hypertonicity, and tenderness on palpation (**VAS Score 6**). Narrowed upper and lower vaginal spaces, widened left and right vaginal spaces. Dusky discoloration over the perianal and sacrococcygeal regions. Depression noted at the coccyx. Sacrum higher on the right, lower on the left. Restricted bilateral heel-to-buttock test. Restricted left hip internal and external rotation; restricted right hip external rotation. Proprioception deficit (poor performance on Nine-Square Grid Proprioception Test). Impaired positional sense within the vagina. Inability to perform pelvic floor muscle contraction, predominantly using thoracic compensatory movement. Restricted bilateral straight leg raise test. Positive bilateral urogenital hiatus examination. Leg length discrepancy (left longer).
    *   **Proprioception Test (Nine-Square Grid Test)**: A nine-square grid with assigned numbers was used for proprioceptive input assessment. A cotton swab randomly stimulated specific areas, and the patient was asked to identify the location to evaluate proprioception. Locations: 1 = Left pubic symphysis, 2 = Clitoris, 3 = Right pubic symphysis; 4 = Left bulbospongiosus muscle, 5 = Perineal orifice, 6 = Right bulbospongiosus muscle; 7 = Left ischial spine, 9 = Right ischial spine; 8 = Perineal central tendon.

### (III) Ancillary Investigations

*   **Pelvic MRI**: ① Anteverted uterus. Heterogeneous signal intensity within the myometrium. Multiple cystic foci in the cervix with clear borders; largest diameter approximately 11 mm. ② Small amount of pelvic fluid. ③ Descended mesentery. Slightly enlarged anteverted and anteflexed uterus. Coccygeal impaction.

### (IV) Diagnosis

1.  Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI)
2.  Pelvic Pain
3.  Anterior and Posterior Vaginal Wall Prolapse
4.  Acquired Pelvic Tilt

## II. Pre-Rehabilitation Quantitative Examination and Assessment

### Physical Findings (Pre-treatment)
*   **Perianal Color**: Dusky grey, extensive area affected
*   **Bowel Movements**: 4-5 times/day, sensation of incomplete evacuation
*   **Urination**: 10-12 times/day, voided volume <150mL
*   **Lower Abdominal Distension/Sensation of Heaviness**: Marked
*   **Lumbosacral Pain**: Moderate
*   **Abdomen**: Distended and flaccid
*   **Levator Ani Muscles**: Tenderness (VAS Score 6), palpable cords
*   **Oxford Muscle Strength Scale**: Grade 0
*   **Lumbar Lordosis**: Excessive anterior curvature angle

### Postural Assessment (Pre-treatment)
*   **Straight Leg Raise Test**: Restricted bilaterally at 50°
*   **Urogenital Hiatus Examination**: Positive bilaterally (+)
*   **Gluteal Folds**: Left higher than right
*   **Heel-to-Buttock Test**: Restricted bilaterally
*   **Iliac Crests**: Right higher than left
*   **Leg Length Discrepancy**: Left longer

### Pelvic MRI Sagittal Plane Comparison (Pre-treatment)
*   **Uterus**: Excessive anteflexion
*   **Pelvic Fluid**: Small amount of fluid
*   **Mesentery**: Descended, compressing the uterine corpus
*   **Rectum**: Compressed
