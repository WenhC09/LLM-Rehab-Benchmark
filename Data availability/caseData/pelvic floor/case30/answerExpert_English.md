# 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
## Short-Term Goals:
*   Alleviate dragging pain in the lumbosacral region, vulva, and buttocks; reduce pain score.
*   Reduce symptoms of stress urinary incontinence; decrease frequency and volume of urine leakage during coughing or sneezing.
*   Improve urination and defecation functions; relieve urinary frequency, urgency, difficulty in stool evacuation, and sensation of incomplete emptying.
*   Reduce abnormal hypertonicity in pelvic floor and surrounding muscles (e.g., obturator internus, iliococcygeus); release fascial adhesions.
*   Initially correct positional abnormalities of the pelvis, uterus, and sacrococcygeal bones.
*   Improve sleep quality and stabilize mood.

## Long-Term Goals:
*   Rebuild pelvic floor muscle strength, endurance, and neuromuscular control; restore normal pelvic floor function; eliminate urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.
*   Correct overall postural and biomechanical abnormalities (e.g., pelvic tilt, leg length discrepancy, excessive lumbar lordosis); establish proper abdominopelvic coordination patterns.
*   Restore pelvic floor proprioception and intravaginal positional sense.
*   Establish healthy bowel and bladder habits; achieve functional independence.
*   Enhance the patient’s ability to manage pain and negative emotions; improve quality of life.
*   Through health education and home-based rehabilitation guidance, empower the patient with self-management strategies to prevent recurrence.

# 2. Treatment Methods:
## Manual Therapy
*   **Fascial Manipulation:** Release tense fascial tissues in the abdomen, diaphragm, thoracolumbar fascia, adductors, and pubic region using compression and friction techniques. Goals: Relieve fascial densification, balance fascial tension, restore normal gliding between fascia and muscles, relax abdominopelvic structures, alleviate pain, and increase joint mobility.
*   **Pelvic Floor Myofascial Release:** Stimulate proprioceptors in pelvic floor tendons, fascia, and ligaments to enhance neuromuscular responses. Technique: With patient in lateral decubitus position, therapist inserts a finger into the anus to locate and release painful, contracted fascial trigger points and adhesions; release sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments; adjust subluxated sacrococcygeal segments; release perianal and gluteal tension. Concurrently, release trigger points in superficial perineal muscles and the perineal body to reduce pelvic floor muscle tone, improve local circulation, and enhance proprioception, strength, and endurance.
*   **Uterine-Ovarian Regulation Technique:** Address uterine deviation and restricted mobility. Technique: Patient supine, vulva disinfected. One therapist’s finger locates the cervical os intravaginally to assess mobility; the other hand palpates the uterus suprapubically. Using coordinated intra- and extra-pelvic maneuvers, mobilize the restricted uterus to restore its physiological position.
*   **Visceral Manipulation:** Assess and correct restricted organ mobility. Begin with broad abdominal release using the "Prague Waltz" technique. Sequentially apply traction, stimulation, and release to the sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon, jejunum, ileum, and root of the mesentery to restore normal visceral motility and mobility, improve organ dynamics, and promote digestion, peristalsis, and defecation.

## Exercise Therapy
*   **Diaphragmatic Breathing:** Patient supine, lumbar spine flat, pelvis neutral. Inhale deeply through the nose, allowing uniform abdominal expansion. Exhale slowly through the mouth, drawing the abdominal walls inward toward the spine and midline.
*   **Modified Kegel Exercises:** Integrate abdominopelvic coordination. During contraction, visualize the pelvic floor muscles lifting circumferentially toward the umbilicus while engaging the serratus anterior to depress the ribs and transversus abdominis to co-contract. Protocol adjusted per patient ability:
    *   *Initial Stage (Weak Pelvic Floor):* Activate Type II fibers. Quick contractions (1-sec hold, 10-sec rest). 5 reps/set. 6-8 sets/session, 2-3 sessions/day.
    *   *Advanced Stage (Active Contraction Achieved):* Combine Type I/II fiber training. Slow contractions (5-sec hold, 10-sec rest; 3 reps/set) + Quick contractions (1-sec hold; 2 reps/set). One combined set = 1 slow set + 1 quick set. 10 sets/session, 3 sessions/day to enhance coordination and proprioception.
*   **Gluteal Bridge (with Ball):** Supine, knees bent, Pilates ball (~25cm diameter) between knees. Exhale: Contract pelvic floor, posteriorly tilt pelvis, lift hips without lumbar compensation. Inhale: Lower hips.
*   **90/90 Gluteal Bridge:** Supine, feet against wall, hips/knees flexed to 90°. Exhale: Press feet into wall, posteriorly tilt pelvis to lift hips slightly off surface. Inhale: Return.

## Psychological Support
*   **Psychological Counseling:** Apply Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to address pain and negative emotions. Utilize the "Three-column Recording Method" (9-grid chart): Document "Time/Location/Event" triggering distress, "Emotional Response," and "Rational Alternative Perspective/Adaptive Coping Strategy." Analyze records to identify triggers, adjust cognition, guide patient toward calm emotional expression, acceptance, and present-focused awareness.
*   **Psychological Adaptation:**
    *   *Active Listening & Emotional Support:* Provide undivided attention and respect; validate feelings/needs; offer empathy, comfort, and encouragement during distress.
    *   *Relaxation Training:* Instruct in techniques (e.g., deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, mindfulness). Use guided imagery/meditation to cultivate inner calm, reduce anxiety/fear, and improve emotional regulation during pain episodes.

## Health Education
*   Guide patient in adhering to medical advice and adopting health-promoting behaviors. Content includes: Establishing a healthy lifestyle (e.g., avoiding late nights); cultivating regular bowel habits; maintaining stable/positive mood; following balanced dietary principles (reduce fried/cold foods).
