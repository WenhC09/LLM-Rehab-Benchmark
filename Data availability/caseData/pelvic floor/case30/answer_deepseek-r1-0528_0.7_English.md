# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## I. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (0-4 weeks)
1.  Reduce pelvic/lumbosacral pain from VAS 6 to ≤3
2.  Decrease urinary frequency from 10-12 to ≤8 episodes/day
3.  Improve bowel evacuation sensation (reduce defecation frequency from 4-5 to ≤3 times/day)
4.  Restore pelvic floor muscle proprioception (achieve ≥50% accuracy on 9-grid test)
5.  Establish baseline pelvic floor muscle contraction (Oxford Scale 0→1)
6.  Improve hip mobility (increase straight leg raise from 50° to ≥70°)

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months)
1.  Eliminate stress urinary incontinence during coughing/sneezing
2.  Resolve pelvic/lumbosacral pain (VAS≤1)
3.  Normalize bowel/bladder patterns (≤6 urinations/day, complete evacuation sensation)
4.  Restore pelvic symmetry (correct leg length discrepancy and iliac crest alignment)
5.  Achieve independent pelvic floor muscle contraction (Oxford Scale ≥3)
6.  Improve pelvic organ support (reduce vaginal wall prolapse by ≥1 grade)

## II. Treatment Methods

### Phase 1: Pain Modulation & Tissue Normalization (Weeks 1-4)
1.  **Manual Therapy**  
    - Myofascial release for hypertonic levator ani/obturator internus muscles  
    - Intra-vaginal trigger point therapy (targeting VAS 6 tenderness sites)  
    - Pelvic joint mobilizations (sacroiliac/pubic symphysis asymmetry correction)  
    - Visceral mobilization for uterine displacement and rectal compression  

2.  **Modalities**  
    - Thermal biofeedback for pelvic floor relaxation  
    - Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for lumbosacral pain  
    - Warm perineal compresses for dusky perianal discoloration  

3.  **Therapeutic Exercise**  
    - Diaphragmatic breathing re-education (abdominal distension reduction)  
    - Hip mobility drills (internal/external rotation ROM exercises)  
    - Proprioceptive re-education using 9-grid mirror feedback training  

### Phase 2: Neuromuscular Re-education (Weeks 5-8)
1.  **Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation**  
    - Electromyography (EMG)-biofeedback for muscle recruitment  
    - Progressive contraction training (supine→sitting→standing positions)  
    - Knack maneuver training for cough/sneeze control  

2.  **Postural Restoration**  
    - Pelvic clock exercises for anterior tilt correction  
    - Heel-to-buttock mobilization for coccygeal impaction  
    - Core stabilization with transverse abdominis activation  

3.  **Functional Retraining**  
    - Bladder retraining protocol (timed voiding every 2-3 hours)  
    - Defecation dynamics re-education (avoidance of straining)  

### Phase 3: Dynamic Integration (Weeks 9+)
1.  **Advanced Strength Training**  
    - Progressive resistance for levator ani (vaginal weights from 10g)  
    - Eccentric-concentric loading for obturator internus  

2.  **Prolapse Management**  
    - Pessary fitting trial for anterior/posterior wall support  
    - Postural correction during ADLs (sitting/standing alignment)  

3.  **Maintenance Strategies**  
    - Home exercise program with proprioceptive cues (9-grid self-check)  
    - Behavioral modification for fluid/fiber intake optimization  
    - Stress management for sleep improvement (PMR techniques)
