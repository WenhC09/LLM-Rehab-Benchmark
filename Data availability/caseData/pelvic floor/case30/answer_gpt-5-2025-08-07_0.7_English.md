# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4–6 weeks)
- Reduce pelvic floor muscle hypertonicity and tenderness (VAS from 6 to ≤3).
- Improve pelvic floor proprioception and initiate voluntary contraction (Oxford grade from 0 to ≥1).
- Decrease urinary frequency from 10–12 times/day to ≤8 times/day and increase voided volume toward ≥200 mL.
- Reduce lumbosacral and pelvic pain to improve sitting and standing tolerance.
- Improve defecation dynamics, reducing sensation of incomplete evacuation and toilet sitting time.
- Correct pelvic asymmetry and increase hip and lumbar mobility (straight leg raise from 50° to ≥70°).
- Enhance abdominal wall tone to reduce lower abdominal distension/heaviness.

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months)
- Achieve functional pelvic floor muscle strength (Oxford grade ≥3) with coordinated contraction and relaxation.
- Eliminate or significantly reduce stress urinary incontinence episodes during coughing/sneezing.
- Correct pelvic tilt and improve postural alignment to prevent recurrence of symptoms.
- Normalize bladder and bowel habits (urination 6–7 times/day, voided volume ≥250 mL, bowel movements 1–2 times/day without straining).
- Resolve or markedly reduce pelvic pain, enabling normal sexual function and daily physical activities.
- Maintain stable abdominal core strength to support pelvic organ positioning and prevent further prolapse progression.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Pelvic Floor Muscle Rehabilitation
1. **Manual Therapy**
   - Internal myofascial release of obturator internus, iliococcygeus, ischiococcygeus, and levator ani arcus tendineus to reduce hypertonicity and tenderness.
   - Gentle mobilization of coccyx and sacrum to improve mobility and relieve impaction.
2. **Biofeedback Training**
   - Initiate with surface electromyography (sEMG) to improve proprioception and teach isolated pelvic floor muscle activation.
   - Begin with visualization and tactile cues to reduce thoracic compensation.
3. **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**
   - Low-frequency stimulation to promote initial contraction in weak pelvic floor muscles (Oxford 0).
4. **Proprioceptive Training**
   - Nine-Square Grid re-education with graded tactile stimuli to improve positional sense in the perineum.

### B. Core and Postural Rehabilitation
1. **Transversus Abdominis and Diaphragmatic Breathing Training**
   - Encourage coordinated breathing with pelvic floor relaxation/contraction cycles.
2. **Abdominal Wall Toning**
   - Low-load isometric and dynamic exercises to restore abdominal wall support.
3. **Pelvic Tilt Correction**
   - Manual alignment techniques for pubic symphysis and iliac crest leveling.
   - Strengthening of gluteal and hip stabilizers to maintain pelvic symmetry.

### C. Mobility and Flexibility Training
1. **Hip Joint Mobility**
   - Gentle stretching for restricted hip internal/external rotation.
   - Heel-to-buttock test–based quadriceps stretching to restore full range.
2. **Hamstring and Lumbar Flexibility**
   - Progressive straight leg raise mobilization.
3. **Lumbar Spine Stabilization**
   - Core stabilization exercises to normalize lumbar lordosis.

### D. Bladder and Bowel Retraining
1. **Bladder Training Program**
   - Scheduled voiding with gradual extension of intervals between urinations.
   - Fluid intake management and avoidance of bladder irritants.
2. **Defecation Dynamics Coaching**
   - Education on optimal toileting posture (e.g., footstool use to enhance anorectal angle).
   - Abdominal breathing during defecation to avoid straining.

### E. Pain Management
1. **Physical Modalities**
   - Local heat therapy to lumbosacral and pelvic areas for muscle relaxation.
   - TENS for pelvic pain modulation.
2. **Soft Tissue Therapy**
   - Myofascial release for lumbosacral and gluteal regions.

### F. Education and Lifestyle Guidance
- Instruction on avoiding heavy lifting, prolonged standing, or high-impact activities during initial rehabilitation.
- Cough suppression techniques and pelvic floor protection strategies during increases in intra-abdominal pressure.
- Weight management counseling if indicated.

### G. Monitoring and Reassessment
- Reassess pelvic floor muscle strength (Oxford scale), pain (VAS), urinary/bowel diaries, and postural alignment every 2–4 weeks.
- Adjust program intensity and progression based on patient tolerance and improvement.
