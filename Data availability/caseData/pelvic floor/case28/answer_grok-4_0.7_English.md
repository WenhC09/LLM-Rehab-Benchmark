# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks):
- Reduce pelvic pain (VAS score) from 8/10 to 4/10 or lower.
- Improve sleep quality by reducing pain-related disturbances.
- Enhance patient’s ability to sit for short periods (15–30 minutes) without significant discomfort.
- Decrease anxiety symptoms through pain management and patient education.
- Improve pelvic floor muscle coordination and relaxation to reduce tenderness in the left iliococcygeus, obturator internus, and arcus tendineus levator ani.

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
- Achieve sustained pain reduction to VAS score of 2/10 or lower, enabling comfortable sitting for extended periods (>1 hour).
- Restore normal pelvic floor muscle function and strength to Modified Oxford Scale Grade V.
- Eliminate tenderness in the affected pelvic floor muscles (iliococcygeus, obturator internus, and arcus tendineus levator ani).
- Improve psychological well-being, with minimal to no anxiety related to chronic pain.
- Enable return to daily activities, including prolonged sitting and light physical activities, without pain or discomfort.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### a. Pain Management
- **Manual Therapy**: Gentle myofascial release targeting the left iliococcygeus, obturator internus, and arcus tendineus levator ani, avoiding aggressive intra-pelvic manipulation due to prior worsening of symptoms. Sessions to be conducted by a trained pelvic floor physiotherapist, 1–2 times per week for 4 weeks, with reassessment to determine continuation.
- **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)**: Apply TENS to the sacrococcygeal region to modulate pain. Settings: low-frequency (2–5 Hz), 30-minute sessions, 3–5 times per week for 4 weeks. Adjust based on patient tolerance and pain response.
- **Heat Therapy**: Apply moist heat packs to the sacrococcygeal and pelvic region for 15–20 minutes daily to promote muscle relaxation and reduce pain.
- **Pharmacological Support**: Collaborate with a pain management specialist to consider short-term use of non-opioid analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen) or low-dose muscle relaxants if muscle spasms persist. Avoid NSAIDs if no inflammation is evident on imaging or clinical exam.

### b. Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation
- **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT)**: Initiate graded pelvic floor muscle exercises focusing on relaxation rather than strengthening, given Grade IV strength but tenderness and pain. Exercises include diaphragmatic breathing combined with gentle pelvic floor contractions and relaxations (10 repetitions, 3 sets daily). Avoid over-contraction to prevent exacerbating tenderness.
- **Biofeedback Therapy**: Use surface EMG biofeedback to improve pelvic floor muscle coordination and relaxation. Conduct 30-minute sessions, 1–2 times per week for 6 weeks, guided by a pelvic floor therapist to ensure proper muscle isolation and relaxation.
- **Kegel Exercises (Modified)**: Introduce low-intensity Kegel exercises after 4 weeks if tenderness decreases, focusing on endurance (5-second holds, 10 repetitions, 2 sets daily) to enhance pelvic floor stability without triggering pain.

### c. Postural and Functional Training
- **Seating Modifications**: Recommend a coccyx cut-out cushion or donut pillow to reduce pressure on the coccyx during sitting. Educate on proper sitting posture to minimize pelvic floor strain.
- **Core Stabilization Exercises**: Introduce low-impact core exercises (e.g., pelvic tilts, bird-dog exercises) to improve pelvic stability and reduce compensatory muscle tension. Perform 10 repetitions, 2 sets daily, ensuring no increase in pelvic pain.
- **Body Mechanics Education**: Train the patient in proper body mechanics for daily activities (e.g., standing, transitioning from sitting to standing) to minimize coccygeal and pelvic stress. Conduct 1 session per week for 4 weeks with a physiotherapist.

### d. Psychological Support
- **Cognitive Behavioral TherapyCBT)**: Refer to a clinical psychologist for CBT to address and pain-related distress. Weekly 45-minute sessions for 8 weeks to develop coping strategies and improve sleep quality.
- **Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)**: Recommend guided mindfulness meditation (10–15 minutes daily) to reduce anxiety and improve pain perception. Provide resources for home practice, such as audio-guided sessions.

### e. Patient Education and Lifestyle Modifications
- **Pain Education**: Educate the patient on chronic pelvic pain mechanisms, emphasizing the role of central sensitization and muscle tension. Provide reassurance that no structural abnormalities were found on imaging to reduce fear-avoidance behaviors.
- **Sleep Hygiene**: Advise on sleep hygiene practices, including maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine after 2 PM, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine to improve sleep quality.
- **Activity Pacing**: Teach the patient to pace activities to avoid overexertion, with gradual increases in sitting time and physical activity as pain decreases.

### f. Monitoring and Follow-Up
- **Reassessment Schedule**: Conduct follow-up evaluations every 4 weeks to assess VAS pain scores, pelvic floor muscle tenderness, and functional improvements. Adjust the treatment plan based on progress.
- **Outcome Measures**: Use the Pelvic Pain Impact Questionnaire (PPIQ) and Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) to track subjective improvements in pain and function.
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Coordinate with a pain management specialist, pelvic floor physiotherapist, and psychologist to ensure a holistic approach. Schedule a multidisciplinary case review at 8 weeks to evaluate progress and plan next steps.

### g. Precautions
- Avoid aggressive intra-pelvic manual therapy due to prior symptom exacerbation.
- Monitor for signs of increased pain or new symptoms during exercises, and adjust intensity or discontinue as needed.
- Ensure patient adherence to the prescribed regimen through regular follow-ups and motivational interviewing techniques.
