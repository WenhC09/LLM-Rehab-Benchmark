# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks)
- Reduce coccygeal and anococcygeal region pain from VAS 8/10 to ≤5/10.
- Improve sitting tolerance from current inability to ≥10–15 minutes with acceptable discomfort.
- Decrease tenderness in left iliococcygeus, obturator internus, and arcus tendineus levator ani regions.
- Improve sleep quality by reducing pain-related nocturnal awakenings.
- Alleviate pelvic floor muscle tension while maintaining muscle strength (Grade IV).

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months)
- Achieve pain control to VAS ≤2/10 during daily activities, including prolonged sitting.
- Restore normal sitting tolerance (≥1 hour) without significant discomfort.
- Enable return to normal work and social activities.
- Maintain pelvic floor muscle coordination and strength to support bladder and bowel function and prevent pelvic organ prolapse progression.
- Minimize recurrence risk through patient self-management strategies.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### (A) Pain Management
- **Physical Modalities**:  
  - Low-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) applied to coccygeal and pericoccygeal region, 20–30 min/session, 1–2 times daily.
  - Superficial heat therapy (moist hot packs) to pelvic floor region to promote muscle relaxation before manual therapy.
- **Manual Therapy**:  
  - Gentle external myofascial release targeting pelvic floor-adjacent structures (gluteal, piriformis, obturator internus via ischial tuberosity approach) avoiding aggravating intra-pelvic manipulation in acute pain phase.
  - Gradual desensitization techniques over tender points.

### (B) Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation
- **Pelvic Floor Muscle Relaxation Training**:  
  - Diaphragmatic breathing combined with pelvic floor drop exercises (reverse Kegels), 10–15 min, 2–3 times/day.
- **Muscle Coordination Training**:  
  - Once pain is reduced, integrate contract–relax cycles to improve neuromuscular control without increasing resting tone.
- **Postural and Core Stability**:  
  - Gentle core strengthening (transversus abdominis activation, pelvic tilts) to improve pelvic support and reduce strain on coccyx.

### (C) Activity Modification & Ergonomics
- Advise use of coccyx-cutout cushions for sitting.
- Avoid prolonged sitting and high-impact activities during early rehabilitation.
- Introduce gradual sitting tolerance training with supportive surfaces.

### (D) Psychological Support
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or relaxation training to address anxiety and pain-related fear.
- Sleep hygiene education to improve rest quality.

### (E) Patient Education
- Explain pain mechanism and rehabilitation process to reduce catastrophizing.
- Teach self-massage and stretching (hip rotators, piriformis) to maintain tissue flexibility.
- Encourage regular, low-impact aerobic activity (e.g., walking, swimming) to improve circulation and mood.

### (F) Medical Coordination
- Coordinate with pain management team for pharmacologic support if pain limits participation (e.g., NSAIDs, neuropathic pain agents as indicated).
- Monitor for pelvic organ prolapse symptoms given POP-Q findings, refer to urogynecology if progression noted.

### (G) Progress Monitoring
- Reassess VAS, sitting tolerance, pelvic floor muscle tone and strength, and tenderness every 2–4 weeks.
- Adjust therapy intensity and techniques based on pain response and functional gains.
