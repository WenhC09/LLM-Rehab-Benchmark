# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (0-4 weeks):
- Reduce pelvic pain VAS score from 8/10 to ≤5/10 at rest
- Achieve tolerance for 15 minutes of semi-recumbent sitting (45° incline)
- Decrease tenderness at left iliococcygeus/obturator internus by 50% on palpation
- Improve sleep quality through pain management strategies
- Establish basic pelvic floor muscle awareness without exacerbation

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Maintain pelvic pain VAS ≤3/10 during daily activities
- Restore functional sitting tolerance >30 minutes for work/meals
- Normalize pelvic floor muscle tension and coordination
- Eliminate referred pain during sexual activity/intercourse
- Independent management of symptom flares

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Pain Modulation
- **Neuromodulation**: Pudendal nerve TENS (10-100Hz) targeting SSR pathways, 20min BID  
- **Thermal Therapy**: Localized cryotherapy to coccyx region 15min QID (avoiding direct skin contact)  
- **Topical Analgesia**: Compounded 5% lidocaine/2% diclofenac gel to tender points TID  

### Manual Therapy
- **External Techniques**:  
  - Myofascial release of left sacrotuberous/sacrospinous ligaments  
  - Strain-counterstrain for iliococcygeus trigger points  
- **Internal Techniques (Contraindicated until pain <5/10 VAS)**:  
  - Intravaginal ischemic compression of obturator internus via greater sciatic foramen (Grade II oscillations)  
  - Pelvic clock exercises in side-lying  

### Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation
- **Biofeedback-Guided Relaxation**:  
  - SEMG-assisted down-training of hypertonic pelvic floor (4s contraction/20s relaxation cycles)  
  - Progressive desensitization to pressure using vaginal dilators (starting with smallest size)  
- **Postural Re-education**:  
  - Modified sitting posture training (forward lean with coccyx offloading cushion)  
  - Diaphragmatic breathing-synchronized pelvic floor release  

### Adjunctive Therapies
- **Graded Activity Exposure**:  
  - Supine-to-sit transitions with progressive time increments (start 5min 3x/day)  
  - Sleep positioning modification: Side-lying with pillow support between knees  
- **Psychological Integration**:  
  - Pain neuroscience education for central sensitization  
  - Cognitive-behavioral strategies for pain catastrophizing  
  - Sleep hygiene protocol (fixed wake time, stimulus control)  

### Monitoring Parameters
- Biweekly VAS assessments with pain mapping  
- Monthly reassessment of POP-Q staging and tender point reactivity  
- Pelvic floor surface EMG progress documentation at 4-week intervals  
- Abort internal techniques if pain increases >2 VAS points post-treatment
