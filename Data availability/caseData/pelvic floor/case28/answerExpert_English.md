# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-Term Goals
*   Alleviate pain in the anal and coccygeal regions, significantly reducing Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores from 8 points.  
*   Relieve anxiety caused by pain and improve sleep quality.  
*   Initially improve tolerance in sitting and supine positions.  

### Long-Term Goals  
*   Completely resolve pain in the coccygeal region, reducing VAS scores to minimal levels (1 point or below).  
*   Correct underlying causes of pain, such as tendon injuries and coccygeal dislocation.  
*   Restore normal function and tension of the pelvic floor muscle group.  
*   Reestablish the patient’s normal daily activities, particularly pain-free sitting function, and comprehensively enhance quality of life.  

## 2. Treatment Methods  

The patient’s rehabilitation strategy is based on precise diagnostic assessment and phased treatment adjustments. Specific implementation is as follows:  

**Phase 1: Initial Treatment for Tendon Injuries**  

Intracavitary examination revealed definitive trigger points in the left iliococcygeus, obturator internus, and levator ani muscle tendon arch. Given that previous intracavitary manual therapy exacerbated pain, the pain is preliminarily attributed to post-traumatic tendon injury. Non-invasive approaches are selected to avoid aggravating the injury.  
*   **Focused Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy:** Target tender points in the left iliococcygeus, obturator internus, and levator ani tendon arch to reduce local inflammation, promote tendon tissue repair, and alleviate muscle spasms and pain.  
*   **Therapeutic Exercise:** Implement targeted exercise training coordinated with shock wave therapy to enhance pelvic floor and surrounding muscle function.  

*This phase comprises 3 sessions, aiming to reduce VAS pain scores from 8 points. Reassess VAS scores after each session until no further reduction is observed.*  

**Phase 2: Re-evaluation and Addressing Root Causes**  

Given the plateau effect in Phase 1, the patient underwent reassessment.  
*   **Repeat Intracavitary Palpation Assessment:** Revealed resolved tenderness in the obturator internus and levator ani tendon arch, but persistent tenderness in the left sacrospinous ligament and iliococcygeus muscle, suggesting additional pain sources.  
*   **Digital Rectal Examination:** Identified coccygeal dislocation.  

Based on new findings, the treatment plan was adjusted to address root causes:  
*   **Transanal Manual Reduction of Coccygeal Dislocation:** Performed by a rehabilitation physician via digital rectal examination to precisely reduce the dislocated coccyx.
