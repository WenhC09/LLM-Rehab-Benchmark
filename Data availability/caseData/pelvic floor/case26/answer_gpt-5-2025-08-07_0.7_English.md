# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4–6 weeks)
- Reduce pelvic/perineal and lumbosacral pain to VAS ≤ 3/10.
- Decrease pelvic floor muscle resting tone and trigger point sensitivity.
- Improve pelvic floor muscle contractility from Power 2 to ≥ 3 on Modified Oxford Scale.
- Achieve endurance of ≥ 5 seconds for sustained pelvic floor contraction.
- Improve sitting and standing tolerance to ≥ 30 minutes without significant aggravation of symptoms.
- Enhance lumbar-pelvic mobility and core muscle activation without pain exacerbation.

### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
- Restore coordinated pelvic floor muscle function with effective elevation, co-contraction, and reflex timing during activities such as coughing.
- Improve bladder neck stability and reduce prolapse-related symptoms.
- Maintain lumbar spine stability and flexibility to prevent recurrence of pain.
- Enable full participation in daily activities, including work and household tasks, without pelvic/lumbar pain limitations.
- Educate patient on long-term self-management strategies for pelvic floor and lumbar health.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Pain Management & Muscle Tone Regulation
- **Myofascial release therapy**: Gentle manual release techniques targeting superficial pelvic floor muscles, pubococcygeus, iliococcygeus, obturator internus, coccygeus, and gluteal trigger points; frequency 2–3 times/week.
- **Surface EMG biofeedback relaxation training**: Use EMG to guide patient in lowering resting pelvic floor tone before strengthening; 15–20 minutes/session.
- **Modalities for pain relief**:  
  - Low-intensity transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to lumbosacral region and perineal area (avoid high intensity to prevent muscle guarding).  
  - Superficial heat therapy to lumbar and pelvic region to promote circulation and reduce spasm.

### B. Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT)
- **Initial phase**: Focus on relaxation phase training to address hypertonicity before strengthening.
- **Progressive strengthening**:  
  - Begin with isolated low-load contractions (Power 2 → 3), 3-sec hold, 5–8 reps, 2–3 sets/day.  
  - Gradually increase hold time to 5–7 seconds, aiming for 10 reps.  
  - Integrate with breathing control (exhalation with contraction).
- **Functional training**:  
  - Incorporate “Knack” technique—pre-contraction before coughing/sneezing—once reflex timing improves.  
  - Coordinate with lower abdominal and gluteal activation.

### C. Core & Lumbar Stabilization
- **Lumbar-pelvic stabilization exercises**:  
  - Supine pelvic tilts, bridge with pelvic floor co-activation, bird-dog, modified plank (pain-free range).  
  - Initially low load, progress by increasing duration and complexity.
- **Flexibility training**:  
  - Gentle stretching of hip flexors (Modified Thomas Test +), adductors, piriformis, and lumbar paraspinals.

### D. Postural & Functional Training
- **Postural correction**: Educate on neutral spine, pelvic alignment during sitting, standing, and lifting.
- **Activity modification**: Avoid prolonged standing/sitting > 30 min without movement breaks; avoid heavy lifting and high intra-abdominal pressure activities early on.
- **Ergonomic advice**: Use cushion support for sitting, lumbar roll if needed.

### E. Prolapse-specific Strategies
- **Pelvic organ support training**:  
  - PFMT with emphasis on elevation cue once hypertonicity resolves.  
  - Teach avoidance of Valsalva maneuver during daily tasks.
- **Bladder training**: If symptomatic, address urge suppression and timed voiding.

### F. Education & Self-management
- **Patient education**: Anatomy and function of pelvic floor, role in spine stability, importance of relaxation-strength balance.
- **Home exercise program**: Daily relaxation and strengthening exercises with symptom log.
- **Self-monitoring**: Use VAS and functional tolerance records to guide progression.

### G. Interdisciplinary Collaboration
- **Gynecology**: For ongoing management of uterine prolapse and ovarian cyst.
- **Orthopedics/Spine**: For lumbar disc herniation monitoring; ensure no progression of neurological deficits.
- **Pain management**: If pain persists despite conservative measures.

**Frequency & Duration**:  
- In-clinic rehab: 2–3 sessions/week for 8–12 weeks initially.  
- Home program: Daily, 15–30 minutes.

**Precautions**:  
- Avoid over-recruitment of pelvic floor muscles during early phase to prevent exacerbating spasm.  
- Monitor for neurological changes (numbness, weakness, bladder/bowel dysfunction).  
- Gradual progression; avoid pain provocation.
