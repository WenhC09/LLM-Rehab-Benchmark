# 1. Rehabilitation Goals

## **Short-term Goals:**
*   Improve pelvic floor muscle tone and strength through inpatient rehabilitation, ameliorate uterine prolapse.
*   Effectively alleviate lumbosacral and perineal pain, enhance the patient's quality of daily living.

## **Long-term Goals:**
*   Consolidate and restore normal pelvic floor muscle function through systematic rehabilitation therapy and training, achieving sustained pain relief.
*   Provide health education on pelvic floor muscle training to the patient, enabling mastery of independent rehabilitation exercise methods.

# 2. Treatment Methods

## **Pelvic Floor Myofascial Release and Manual Therapy:**
To alleviate hypertonicity of the pelvic floor muscles, intra- and extra-pelvic myofascial manual techniques are applied for release. Procedures are performed within the patient's tolerance, total duration approximately 15-20 minutes.
*   **External Pressure:** Initially, apply pressure to relax related superficial fascia, focusing on the V6 point for 1-2 minutes.
*   **Intravaginal Manual Release:** Sequentially address specific muscles and fascia. First, stretch the left and right superficial and deep transverse perineal muscles for 1-2 minutes each. Subsequently, apply pressure to the pubococcygeus muscle (PCL-R points) bilaterally for 1-2 minutes each. Then, focus on releasing the left iliococcygeus muscle exhibiting higher tension, treating bilaterally for 2-4 minutes total (longer duration on the left). Following this, release the left and right ischiococcygeus muscles for approximately 3 minutes (longer duration on the left). Next, knead the bilateral arcus tendineus levator ani/pelvic fascia (ATLA/ATPF) for 2 minutes. Subsequently, apply gentle pressure around the urethra at the 1 o'clock and 11 o'clock positions on the anterior vaginal wall for 2-3 minutes, followed by gentle pressure around the clitoris for 3 minutes. Finally, at a depth of 6-7 cm, knead the obturator internus muscles at the 2 o'clock and 10 o'clock positions for 2 minutes each, and knead the bilateral piriformis muscles for 2 minutes each.

## **Pelvic Function and Stability Adjustment:**
*   **Pelvic Adjustment Technique:** Utilize Muscle Energy Technique (MET) to correct pelvic alignment. Patient in side-lying position, therapist flexes hip and knee joints to 90 degrees. Therapist stabilizes the ilium with one hand while palpating the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) with the other, guiding the patient's hip flexion to the restricted barrier. Patient resists with 20% force into hip extension (activating gluteus maximus and biceps femoris) for 10 seconds. After relaxation, the therapist moves the hip joint into the new range of motion. Repeat 3 times.
*   **Adductor Muscle Tension Management:** Assess adductor tension via hip abduction test. Apply MET: Patient supine with knees flexed, heels together. Therapist passively abducts the hip to the point of tightness. Patient resists force into hip adduction for 10 seconds. After relaxation, the therapist moves the hip into greater abduction.
*   **Gluteus Medius Activation:** Assess gluteus medius, tensor fasciae latae, and quadratus lumborum activation sequence via hip abduction activation pattern test. Pelvic malalignment is identified as the root cause of disordered gluteal activation and weakness. Therefore, prioritize correcting pelvic position using pelvic adjustment techniques before initiating strength training to restore normal gluteal activation patterns and intrinsic strength.

## **Comprehensive Treatment for Lumbar Issues:**
Address lumbosacral pain by comprehensively managing sacroiliac joint dysfunction and muscular imbalances.
*   **Muscular Imbalance Management:** Perform targeted myofascial manual release, muscle stretching, and core muscle activation training to address issues such as gluteus maximus weakness, gluteus medius tension, quadriceps tension, erector spinae tension, and core muscle weakness.
*   **Physical Therapy:** Combine acupuncture therapy with moxibustion therapy to alleviate local pain and inflammation.

## **Pelvic Floor Function Strengthening Training:**
After improvement in pelvic floor muscle tone, employ various methods to enhance strength, endurance, and coordination.
*   **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT):** Instruct patient in Kegel exercises combined with diaphragmatic breathing to establish a coordinated pelvic-abdominal movement pattern.
*   **Pelvic Floor Electromyographic Biofeedback (PFB):** Utilize visual and auditory cues from the device to guide correct pelvic floor muscle contraction and relaxation. Initially set the mode to relaxation mode to prioritize hypertonicity management, transitioning later to strength training mode.
*   **Pelvic Floor Magnetic Stimulation (PFMS):** Apply PFMS targeting indicated neural involvement (bilateral abnormal bulbocavernosus reflex on EMG) to enhance neural excitability in the pelvic floor region and passively exercise the pelvic floor muscles.
