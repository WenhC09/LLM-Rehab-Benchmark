# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (0-4 weeks):
- Reduce pelvic/perineal pain from VAS 5/10 to ≤3/10
- Improve pelvic floor muscle (PFM) endurance from 3s to ≥5s sustained contraction
- Normalize resting PFM tension via myofascial release
- Establish proper diaphragmatic breathing pattern
- Improve lumbar mobility by 50% on validated scales

### Long-term goals (8-12 weeks):
- Achieve pain-free sitting/standing >30 minutes
- Restore functional PFM strength (Oxford Scale ≥3)
- Independent pelvic floor neuromuscular re-education
- Optimize lumbo-pelvic stability during ADLs
- Prevent progression of uterine prolapse

## 2. Treatment Methods
### Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation
- **Manual therapy:**  
  - Internal trigger point release (superficial/deep PFM, obturator internus) 3x/week  
  - Connective tissue mobilization (perineal/vaginal fascia)  
- **Biofeedback-guided training:**  
  - EMG biofeedback for PFM recruitment/relaxation cycles  
  - Focus on elevation (PERFECT "E") and co-contraction (PERFECT "C")  
- **Therapeutic exercise:**  
  - Progressive PFM strengthening (Knack maneuver integration)  
  - Graded endurance training: 5x5s holds → 10x10s holds  
  - Adductor magnus stretching with hip stabilization  

### Pain Management
- **Modalities:**  
  - Interferential current (4kHz) to lumbosacral region  
  - Localized thermal therapy for hypertonic PFM  
- **Positional therapy:**  
  - Side-lying sitting protocols with coccygeal cushion  
  - Prone over wedge for lumbar decompression  

### Neuromuscular Re-education
- **Sacral nerve modulation:**  
  - Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) at S2-S4 dermatomes  
- **Motor control training:**  
  - Diaphragmatic breathing with pelvic clock exercises  
  - Cough reflex retraining (timed PFM contraction)  

### Lumbar Stabilization
- **Core rehabilitation:**  
  - Stage 1: Transversus abdominis activation in hook-lying  
  - Stage 2: Dead bug progression with pelvic floor co-activation  
- **Joint mobilization:**  
  - Grade II-III PA glides to hypomobile lumbar segments  
  - Sacroiliac belt for dynamic stabilization  

### Prolapse Management
- **Pessary trial:**  
  - Ring pessary fitting by gynecologist with rehab follow-up  
- **Biomechanical education:**  
  - Energy conservation techniques  
  - Avoidance of Valsalva maneuvers during lifting  

### Precautions & Referrals
1. Avoid high-impact activities and prolonged sitting >20 mins  
2. Gynecological consult for ovarian cyst monitoring  
3. Neurosurgical evaluation for symptomatic sacral canal cyst  
4. Dietary modification for constipation prevention
