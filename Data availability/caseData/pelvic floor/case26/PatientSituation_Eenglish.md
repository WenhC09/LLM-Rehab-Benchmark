# Case Information

## I. Medical Record Summary

### (A) History of Present Illness

**Patient:** Female, 41 years old.

**Chief Complaint:** Pelvic/perineal pain with lumbosacral pain for over 1 year.

**Present Illness:** The patient developed lumbosacral pain without obvious cause 1 year ago. Symptoms improved after acupuncture and massage therapy at a local hospital. Subsequently, perineal pain developed following dilation and curettage (D&C) at a local clinic, presenting as aching and distending pain. Unable to sit or stand for prolonged periods. Multiple hospital visits suggested "Lumbar Disc Herniation" and "Uterine Prolapse." Rehabilitation treatments including acupuncture and physiotherapy showed no significant improvement. Admitted for further evaluation. Since onset, mental status good, normal diet/sleep, normal bowel/bladder function, no significant weight change.

**Past Medical History:** Previously healthy. Denies chronic diseases (hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes). Denies infectious diseases (hepatitis, tuberculosis). Underwent D&C 1 year ago (details unknown). Denies trauma or transfusion history. No known drug/food allergies. Vaccination history unknown.

**Obstetric & Menstrual History:** Married at appropriate age. G2. Spouse healthy. Menarche at age 13. Cycle: 4-6 days/20-30 days, moderate flow, no clots, no dysmenorrhea. Normal vaginal discharge without odor.

**Family History:** Parents healthy. No similar familial diseases. Denies family history of infectious, psychiatric, or hereditary diseases.

### (B) Physical Examination & Quantitative Assessments

**1. General Examination**  
Temp 36.7Â°C, Pulse 64 bpm, Resp 20/min, BP 117/78 mmHg. Alert, well-developed, moderate nutrition. Ambulatory, cooperative. Normal skin/mucosa. No superficial lymphadenopathy. Normal head/face/neck/chest structure. Symmetric respiratory movement and vocal fremitus. Normal precordium, regular rhythm, no pathological murmurs. Abdomen soft/nontender. No costovertebral angle tenderness. Anus/rectum and genitals not examined. Normal spinal curvature and mobility, no tenderness. Limbs normal, full ROM, no edema. Physiological reflexes present, pathological reflexes absent.

**2. Specialized Examination & Quantitative Assessments**
*   **Pelvic Floor Manual Muscle Testing:** Trigger points identified via clockwise digital palpation: Superficial pelvic floor muscles, pubococcygeus, iliococcygeus, obturator internus, coccygeus, bilateral adductors. Increased pelvic floor muscle tone. Gluteal tenderness.
*   **Modified Oxford Muscle Strength Scale:** Weak (muscle strength increased but no lifting sensation perceived).
*   **New PERFECT Scheme:**
    *   **P (Power):** 2 (Grade II, poor contractility)
    *   **E (Endurance):** 3 (maintains max contraction for 3 seconds)
    *   **R (Repetitions):** 4 (performs 4 sustained 3-second contractions)
    *   **F (Fast Contraction):** 5 (performs 3 maximum fast contractions)
    *   **E (Elevation):** Absent (no posterior vaginal wall elevation during contraction)
    *   **C (Co-contraction):** Absent (no lower abdominal muscle co-contraction)
    *   **T (Timing):** Absent (no reflexive pelvic floor contraction during coughing)
*   **Special Physical Tests:** Standing Flexion Test (+), Seated Flexion Test (-), Stork Test (+), Downing Test (+), Modified Thomas Test (+).
*   **Visual Analogue Scale (VAS):** 5/10.

### (C) Auxiliary Examinations

*   **Pelvic MRI:** Bilateral pelvic floor myofasciitis.
*   **Lumbar MRI:**
    1.  L4/5 disc bulging with posterior inferior extrusion; L3/4 disc bulging with mild posterior protrusion; L5/S1 disc bulging with posterior protrusion; right posterior annular fissure. Lumbar disc degeneration.
    2.  Lumbar osteophyte formation; sacral canal cyst.
    3.  Mild edema in lumbosacral subcutaneous soft tissue.
    4.  Small cervical cyst; full cervix (endoscopy recommended if necessary); cystic nodule in right adnexa (ultrasound recommended).
*   **Colonoscopy:** Multiple rectal polyps; internal hemorrhoids.
*   **Pelvic Floor Electromyography (EMG):**  
    Pre-rest phase: Increased tone.  
    Fast contraction phase: Reduced muscle strength.  
    Sustained contraction phase: Reduced muscle strength.  
    Endurance contraction phase: Reduced muscle strength.  
    Post-rest phase: Increased tone.
*   **Pelvic Floor Ultrasound:**
    1.  Left ovarian cyst (likely non-neoplastic).
    2.  Significantly increased bladder neck mobility; moderate posterior bladder wall prolapse.
    3.  Middle compartment prolapse: Uterine prolapse.
    4.  Posterior compartment and levator ani hiatus show no significant abnormalities.
*   **Neuroelectrophysiological Examination:**
    1.  Abnormal bilateral bulbocavernosus reflex (suggestive of possible S2-S4 reflex arc involvement - sacrococcygeal plexus or nerve roots).
    2.  Abnormal bilateral ischiocavernosus reflex (suggestive of possible S4-S5 reflex arc involvement - sacrococcygeal plexus or nerve roots).
    3.  No significant abnormalities in clitoral sympathetic skin response (SSR)/somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), limb SSR/SEP, or bilateral anal sphincter EMG.

### (D) Diagnoses

1.  Pelvic Floor Muscle Spasm Syndrome
2.  Uterine Prolapse
3.  Lumbar Disc Herniation (L3/4, L5/S1 disc protrusion; L4/5 disc extrusion)
4.  Osteophyte Formation
5.  Sacral Canal Cyst
6.  Left Ovarian Cyst
