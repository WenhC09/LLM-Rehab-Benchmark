# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4-8 weeks):
- Reduce pelvic/perineal and lumbosacral pain to VAS ≤ 2/10.
- Improve pelvic floor muscle strength to Modified Oxford Scale Grade 3 (fair contractility).
- Enhance pelvic floor endurance to sustain maximum contraction for ≥ 5 seconds.
- Improve bladder neck stability and reduce uterine prolapse symptoms during daily activities.
- Increase lumbosacral mobility without exacerbating pain.

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve pain-free status (VAS 0/10) during sitting, standing, and daily activities.
- Restore pelvic floor muscle strength to Modified Oxford Scale Grade 4 (good contractility).
- Normalize pelvic floor muscle tone and achieve reflexive co-contraction during functional tasks (e.g., coughing).
- Maintain lumbar stability and prevent progression of disc herniation symptoms.
- Optimize functional mobility and quality of life, enabling return to normal activities without restrictions.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Pain Management
- **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS):** Apply TENS to the lumbosacral and pelvic regions (20-30 min/session, 3-5 times/week) to reduce pain and muscle spasms. Use low-frequency settings (2-4 Hz) to target trigger points in pelvic floor muscles and gluteals.
- **Manual Therapy:** Soft tissue mobilization and myofascial release targeting pelvic floor trigger points (pubococcygeus, iliococcygeus, obturator internus, coccygeus, bilateral adductors) and gluteal muscles. Perform 15-20 min/session, 2-3 times/week, by a trained pelvic floor therapist to reduce muscle tone and alleviate pain.
- **Heat Therapy:** Apply moist heat packs to the lumbosacral region (15 min/day) to promote muscle relaxation and improve local circulation.

### B. Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation
- **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT):**  
  - **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Supervised biofeedback-assisted PFMT to improve muscle awareness and coordination. Perform 3 sets of 8-10 contractions (3-second holds, 6-second rest) per session, 3 times/week. Focus on isolating pelvic floor muscles without gluteal or abdominal co-contraction.  
  - **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Progress to 4-5 sets of 10 contractions (5-second holds, 10-second rest), incorporating fast contractions (1-second holds, 5 reps/set). Aim to achieve posterior vaginal wall elevation.  
  - **Home Exercise Program:** Teach patient to perform PFMT daily (2-3 sets of 10 contractions) with proper technique to reinforce clinic-based training.
- **Biofeedback Therapy:** Use surface EMG biofeedback (2-3 sessions/week, 20 min/session) to enhance pelvic floor muscle control and reduce hypertonicity. Target normalization of pre- and post-rest tone and improve fast and sustained contraction phases.
- **Bladder Training:** Implement scheduled voiding (every 2-3 hours) to reduce bladder neck mobility and support uterine positioning. Educate patient on proper voiding posture to minimize strain.

### C. Lumbar Spine Stabilization
- **Core Strengthening Exercises:** Initiate gentle core stabilization exercises (e.g., pelvic tilts, bird-dog, and modified planks) to support lumbar disc health and reduce strain. Perform 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps, 3 times/week, ensuring neutral spine alignment to avoid aggravating disc herniation.
- **Postural Training:** Educate patient on proper sitting and standing postures to minimize lumbosacral stress. Use lumbar roll support during prolonged sitting. Conduct 10-15 min/session of postural correction exercises, 2 times/week.
- **Stretching Program:** Include gentle hamstring, hip flexor, and piriformis stretches (2-3 sets of 30-second holds, daily) to address positive Modified Thomas and Stork Tests, improving pelvic and lumbar mobility.

### D. Functional Training
- **Gait and Mobility Training:** Address positive Standing Flexion and Downing Tests by incorporating gait retraining and balance exercises (e.g., single-leg stance, heel-to-toe walking). Perform 10-15 min/session, 3 times/week, to enhance pelvic and lumbar stability during movement.
- **Activity Modification:** Advise patient to avoid prolonged sitting (>30 min) and heavy lifting. Recommend use of supportive seating cushions to reduce perineal pressure.

### E. Adjunct Therapies
- **Acupuncture:** Continue acupuncture (1-2 sessions/week) targeting pelvic and lumbosacral trigger points to complement pain relief and muscle relaxation, based on prior partial response.
- **Patient Education:** Provide education on pelvic floor anatomy, pain triggers, and self-management strategies (e.g., diaphragmatic breathing, stress reduction techniques). Conduct 1 session/week for 4 weeks to empower patient in self-care.

### F. Monitoring and Progression
- **Reassessment:** Reevaluate pelvic floor muscle strength (Modified Oxford Scale), endurance (PERFECT Scheme), and pain (VAS) every 4 weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment intensity.
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Coordinate with a gynecologist for management of uterine prolapse and ovarian cyst, and with a neurologist to monitor sacral nerve involvement (S2-S5 reflex arc abnormalities). Refer for pelvic floor ultrasound follow-up after 8 weeks to assess bladder neck mobility and prolapse.

### G. Precautions
- Avoid high-impact activities (e.g., running, jumping) to prevent exacerbation of lumbar disc herniation or uterine prolapse.
- Monitor for signs of worsening neurological symptoms (e.g., bowel/bladder dysfunction) and refer to a neurologist if present.
- Ensure proper pelvic floor muscle relaxation techniques to prevent overtraining and increased tone.
