# 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
## **Short-Term Goals:**
*   Alleviate patient anxiety and enhance rehabilitation confidence.
*   Eliminate or reduce symptoms of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI).
*   Enhance bladder sensation, enabling recognition of bladder filling and the urge to void.
*   Increase voided volume to 200-300mL per void, improving voiding force.
*   Reduce postvoid residual (PVR) urine volume to <100mL.

## **Long-Term Goals:**
*   Restore normal micturition reflex and voiding function, achieving basic bladder emptying under abdominal pressure.
*   Eliminate dysuria and the sensation of incomplete bladder emptying, achieving independence from intermittent clean catheterization (ICC).
*   Maintain coordinated function of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) and core muscle groups, preserving trunk and pelvic stability.
*   Establish proper voiding habits, prevent long-term complications, and improve long-term quality of life.

# 2. Treatment Methods:
## **1. Rehabilitation Education and Psychological Counseling**
Provide detailed explanations of the physiological mechanisms of micturition and the current condition. Conduct psychological counseling to alleviate anxiety and build confidence in rehabilitation. Instruct the patient on and emphasize adherence to bladder training, pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), and comprehensive rehabilitation exercises.

## **2. Acupuncture Therapy**
Administer comprehensive acupuncture therapy once daily for 25 minutes per session.
*   **Warming, Tonifying, and Regulating Qi:** Select points GV4 (Mingmen), CV3 (Zhongji), CV4 (Guanyuan) to warm and tonify the lower source and assist bladder Qi transformation. Select points BL23 (Shenshu), BL28 (Pangguangshu), BL54 (Zhibian) to regulate bladder Qi activity. Select SP6 (Sanyinjiao) to tonify spleen and promote diuresis, regulating water passage.
*   **Nerve Stimulation:** Stimulate points BL31 (Ciliao), BL32 (Zhongliao), BL33 (Xialiao), BL35 (Huiyang), combined with electroacupuncture. Use a dense-disperse wave at 10/50Hz to stimulate the sacral nerves and pudendal nerve. Intensity is set to patient tolerance, aiming to passively induce rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the detrusor muscle and internal urethral sphincter, thereby promoting the formation of the micturition reflex.

## **3. Magnetic Stimulation Therapy**
Administer twice daily using two modalities:
*   **Non-invasive Sacral Nerve Magnetic Stimulation (SNS):** Position the magnetic coil over the S3 sacral foramen (approximately one fingerbreadth lateral to the midpoint between the upper border of the sacrum and the coccyx). Stimulate at 70%-80% of maximum stimulator output (MSO), frequency 25Hz, intermittent mode "20 seconds ON, 5 seconds OFF" to activate sacral nerves and promote voiding.
*   **Bladder Area Magnetic Stimulation:** Position the magnetic coil over the bladder region. Stimulate at 70%-80% of MSO, frequency 5Hz, intermittent mode "20 seconds ON, 2 seconds OFF" to directly stimulate detrusor contraction.

## **4. Tibial Nerve Electrical Stimulation (PTNS)**
Administer once daily for 30 minutes. Place electrode pads posterior to the medial malleolus and 5cm superior to the medial malleolus. Set stimulation frequency to 10-50Hz. Intensity ranges from 50-100mA, slowly increasing from low to high, adjusted to just below the threshold of patient discomfort or pain. This method utilizes the homology between the tibial nerve and the nerve segments (L4-S3) innervating the bladder to modulate bladder activity. Concurrently, from a Traditional Chinese Medicine perspective, it stimulates the SP6 (Sanyinjiao, crossing point of three Yin meridians) to dredge meridians and regulate water metabolism.

## **5. Bladder Training**
*   **Sensory Training:** Instruct the patient to perceive the location of the bladder, urethra, and urethral meatus, and to recognize the position and sensation of the bladder in both empty and full states.
*   **Voiding Technique Training:** Teach proper voiding technique: first relax the urethra, then contract the bladder, coordinated with mild abdominal pressure (diaphragm and abdominal muscles). Emphasize avoiding forceful abdominal straining during voiding, and avoiding frequent voiding or incomplete bladder emptying to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs).
*   **Voiding Diary and Schedule:** Develop an individualized fluid intake and voiding schedule for the patient. Instruct the patient to maintain a voiding diary to monitor and adjust the training process.

## **6. Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT)**
*   **Proprioceptive Awakening:** Utilize tools like a yoga ball, massage ball, or towel to help the patient, in a seated position, perceive the location, contraction, and relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles, as well as the activity of different pelvic organs and sphincter opening/closing.
*   **Strength and Endurance Training:** Master correct PFM contraction (closing the anus, urethra, and vaginal introitus while lifting upwards and inwards) and relaxation. Each contraction/sustain should last 5-10 seconds, followed by complete relaxation for 5-10 seconds. Repeat 5-8 times per set, completing at least 3 sets daily.
*   **"The Knack" Training:** Prior to activities increasing abdominal pressure (e.g., coughing, sneezing, jumping), rapidly and actively contract and lift the PFM to close the urethra, enhance continence, and establish feed-forward control.

## **7. Comprehensive Rehabilitation Training**
Strengthen training in respiration and posture, focusing on neuromuscular re-education of the four key core muscle groups: diaphragm, pelvic floor muscles (PFM), transversus abdominis (TrA), and multifidus. Promote optimal synergy between these muscles. Enhance body balance and motor control by regulating intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), thereby maintaining trunk and pelvic stability and facilitating normal load transfer.
