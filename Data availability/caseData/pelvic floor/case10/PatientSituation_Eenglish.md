# Medical Record Summary

## (I) Case History

**Patient:** Female, 30 years old.

**Chief Complaint:** Difficulty voiding for over 5 months postpartum.

**Present Illness:**  
The patient reported delivering a male infant (birth weight 3.1 kg) via painless vaginal delivery at an external hospital in July 2019. The second stage of labor lasted 4 hours, with mediolateral episiotomy and no instrumental assistance. During delivery, the patient did not urinate. At 4 hours postpartum, she remained without urinary urge and was unable to void. Abdominal massage and local heat application were ineffective, prompting catheterization with approximately 1200 mL urine output. Four hours post-catheterization, she developed abdominal distension without urinary urge. Following warm compress application and auditory voiding stimulation, minimal urine was passed. Persistent lower abdominal distension and dull pain led to recatheterization (600 mL output). Diagnosed with postpartum urinary retention, she was discharged with an indwelling catheter.  
Five days later, she developed a urinary tract infection. After catheter removal, she could void small amounts but reported weak stream and sensation of incomplete emptying. Ultrasound indicated post-void residual (PVR) volume of ~220 mL. Subsequent treatments included physical therapy, acupuncture, and intermittent clean catheterization at local hospitals, with partial improvement in voided volume. Persistent symptoms included impaired bladder sensation, straining during micturition, and incomplete emptying. She presented to our Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation Clinic in December 2019.  
Since onset: Mildly reduced appetite and poor sleep quality. Breastfeeding discontinued at 1 month postpartum. Reports minor stress urinary incontinence during vigorous coughing. Denies urinary frequency/urgency. Normal bowel movements. No significant weight change.

**Past History:**  
Denies chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, neurological/urogenital disorders). No smoking/alcohol history. Denies extramarital sexual contact, sexually transmitted infections, or trauma. No family history of genetic or similar disorders.

**Gynecological & Obstetric History:**  
Married. G1P1 (vaginal delivery). Spouse and child healthy. Postpartum amenorrhea. Barrier contraception.  
Menarche at age 13; cycle 28-30 days, duration 5-7 days. Previously normal menstrual flow (no clots), no dysmenorrhea. Regular cycles with normal leukorrhea.

**Family History:**  
Parents alive and well. Child healthy. Denies familial infectious/hereditary diseases.

## (II) Physical Examination

**General Examination:**
*   T 36.4°C, P 85 bpm, R 20/min, BP 110/80 mmHg, Wt 52 kg.
*   Alert, moderate nutrition. Forward head posture, thoracic kyphosis, upper chest breathing pattern. Clear lung sounds bilaterally; no rales. Cardiopulmonary exam unremarkable.
*   Soft abdomen; no tenderness/rebound pain. Murphy's sign (-). No palpable masses. Liver/spleen non-palpable. No hepatic/renal percussion tenderness. Shifting dullness (-). Normal bowel sounds.
*   Normal extremities/spine. Physiological reflexes intact. No pathological reflexes.

**Specialized Examination:**
*   Pelvic anterior tilt, right hip internal rotation. Thomas test (+).
*   Abdominal muscle laxity and weakness. Diastasis recti abdominis (2.5 cm at umbilical level).
*   Normal vulvar development. 3 cm perineal scar visible near left perineal body.
*   Poor superficial pelvic floor muscle contraction. Incomplete vaginal orifice closure with anterior vaginal wall prolapse.
*   **POP-Q & PERFECT Assessment:**  
    Stress test (+) with full bladder.  
    Bladder neck elevation test (+).  
    Minimal white, odorless vaginal discharge. Cervix smooth, hypertrophic. Uterus anteverted, normal size, medium consistency. Adnexae unremarkable.  
    No pelvic tenderness. Normal anal sphincter contraction.

## (III) Auxiliary Examinations

1.  **Urodynamics (External Hospital):**  
    Normal bladder sensation and compliance. No detrusor overactivity. Absent detrusor contraction during voiding phase. No urine flow observed.
2.  **Pelvic Floor EMG (External Hospital):**  
    Normal cortical motor conduction. Abnormal pudendal nerve cortical somatosensory evoked potentials. Abnormal sacral reflex arc conduction. Normal pudendal nerve motor conduction. Abnormal sympathetic skin response in frontal region. Normal anal sphincter voluntary contraction.
3.  **Pelvic Floor Ultrasound (External Hospital):**  
    Hyper-mobile bladder neck. Anterior vaginal wall prolapse. Urethral rotation angle >45°. Bladder neck funneling. Type II cystocele. Enlarged levator hiatus. No uterine prolapse, rectocele, levator ani muscle tear, or anal sphincter disruption.
4.  **Bladder Scan & Voiding Diary:**  
    Post-void residual volume 160-200 mL.
