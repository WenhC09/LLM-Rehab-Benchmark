# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Improve bladder sensation and urge to void within 4-6 weeks.
- Decrease post-void residual volume to less than 100 mL.
- Enhance pelvic floor muscle strength to at least Grade 4 on the PERFECT scale within 8 weeks.
- Educate the patient on pelvic floor exercises and bladder training techniques.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve complete bladder emptying without the need for catheterization.
- Resolve stress urinary incontinence episodes during physical activities.
- Maintain pelvic floor muscle strength and coordination to prevent future pelvic organ prolapse.
- Improve overall quality of life and return to normal activities, including breastfeeding.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
- **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT):** 
  - Implement a structured PFMT program focusing on both slow and fast contractions, aiming for 3 sets of 10 repetitions, 3 times a week.
  - Use biofeedback to enhance awareness and control of pelvic floor muscles.

- **Bladder Training:**
  - Initiate a bladder training program to gradually increase intervals between voiding, aiming for 3-4 hours between voids.
  - Encourage the patient to respond to the urge to void rather than waiting for a strong sensation.

- **Manual Therapy:**
  - Perform myofascial release and soft tissue mobilization techniques to address abdominal muscle laxity and improve pelvic alignment.
  - Focus on the perineal scar to enhance tissue mobility and sensitivity.

- **Electrical Stimulation:**
  - Consider using neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) for pelvic floor muscles to improve strength and coordination, particularly if voluntary contractions remain weak.

- **Education and Lifestyle Modifications:**
  - Provide education on proper voiding techniques, including double voiding and the use of abdominal massage to facilitate bladder emptying.
  - Discuss dietary modifications to prevent constipation and promote regular bowel movements.

- **Follow-up and Monitoring:**
  - Schedule regular follow-up appointments every 2-4 weeks to monitor progress, adjust the treatment plan as necessary, and reassess bladder function and pelvic floor strength.
  - Utilize urodynamic studies and bladder scans periodically to evaluate improvements in bladder function and post-void residual volumes.
