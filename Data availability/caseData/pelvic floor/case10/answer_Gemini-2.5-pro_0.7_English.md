# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

**Date:** December 2019

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (4-6 weeks):

1.  **Bladder Management:** Achieve consistent complete bladder emptying (Post-Void Residual [PVR] < 100 mL) using a combination of spontaneous voiding and clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) to prevent urinary tract infections and protect bladder health.
2.  **Neuromuscular Re-education:** Improve pelvic floor muscle (PFM) strength to Grade 3+ and endurance to 5 seconds. Establish conscious control over PFM relaxation to aid in voiding.
3.  **Symptom Reduction:** Decrease straining during micturition and improve awareness of bladder fullness. Reduce episodes of stress urinary incontinence.
4.  **Core and Postural Foundation:** Establish a correct diaphragmatic breathing pattern and initiate deep core muscle (transversus abdominis) activation. Begin postural correction exercises.
5.  **Patient Education:** Ensure the patient has a thorough understanding of her condition (pudendal nerve neuropraxia), the rationale for the treatment plan, and proficiency in her home program, including CIC, timed voiding, and therapeutic exercises.

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):

1.  **Restoration of Voiding Function:** Achieve efficient, spontaneous voiding with minimal PVR (< 50 mL) and discontinue the need for CIC.
2.  **Continence:** Achieve full urinary continence with a negative cough stress test.
3.  **Functional Strength:** Attain full PFM strength (Grade 5), endurance (10 seconds), and automatic, reflexive PFM contraction with increases in intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., coughing, lifting).
4.  **Musculoskeletal Restoration:** Resolve diastasis recti (width < 2 cm), achieve functional core stability, and correct postural imbalances (anterior pelvic tilt, thoracic kyphosis).
5.  **Improved Quality of Life:** Return to all desired daily and recreational activities without urinary dysfunction or limitations.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### (I) Bladder Function Rehabilitation

1.  **Bladder Retraining Program:**
    *   **Timed Voiding:** Instruct the patient to void on a fixed schedule (every 2.5-3 hours) during waking hours, regardless of urge, to prevent bladder overdistension.
    *   **Double Voiding Technique:** After each void, the patient should stand up, move around for a minute, then sit down and attempt to void again to promote more complete emptying.
2.  **Clean Intermittent Catheterization (CIC):**
    *   Continue CIC regimen. Initially, perform post-void catheterization 3-4 times daily to drain residual urine and monitor PVR volume.
    *   Frequency will be adjusted weekly based on PVR trends, with the goal of gradual tapering as spontaneous voiding efficiency improves.
3.  **Voiding Ergonomics:**
    *   Educate on proper toileting posture: sitting on the toilet with feet supported on a low stool, leaning forward with a straight back, and consciously relaxing the abdomen and pelvic floor. Prohibit straining (Valsalva maneuver).

### (II) Pelvic Floor and Core Neuromuscular Rehabilitation

1.  **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES):**
    *   Utilize an intravaginal probe for electrical stimulation.
    *   **Protocol:** Employ a mixed-frequency program targeting both sensory nerve fiber stimulation (to improve bladder sensation and facilitate the sacral reflex arc) and motor stimulation (to improve PFM strength and endurance).
    *   **Schedule:** 20-minute sessions, 3-5 times per week.
2.  **Electromyography (EMG) Biofeedback:**
    *   Use a vaginal EMG sensor for visual feedback.
    *   **Goals:**
        *   **Uptraining:** Focus on increasing the amplitude and duration of PFM contractions to meet strength and endurance goals.
        *   **Downtraining:** Train conscious, complete relaxation of the PFM. This is critical for reducing outlet resistance during voiding.
        *   **Coordination:** Practice "The Knack"—a quick, strong PFM contraction immediately before and during coughing—to manage stress incontinence.
3.  **Therapeutic Exercise Program:**
    *   **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT):** Based on the PERFECT assessment:
        *   *Endurance:* Start with 3-second holds, aiming for 8-10 repetitions, 3 times daily. Gradually increase hold duration as tolerated.
        *   *Strength:* Focus on maximal voluntary contractions with proper form.
        *   *Fast Contractions:* Continue practicing 10 quick flicks, 3 times daily.
    *   **Core Stabilization:**
        *   Initiate with diaphragmatic breathing coordinated with PFM relaxation (inhale) and contraction (exhale).
        *   Teach transversus abdominis (TrA) activation without breath-holding or substitution patterns.
        *   Progress to exercises that integrate deep core activation to manage diastasis recti.
4.  **Manual Therapy:**
    *   **Perineal Scar Mobilization:** Gentle massage and stretching of the episiotomy scar to improve tissue pliability and reduce any potential restrictions.
    *   **Internal Myofascial Release:** (If indicated on follow-up assessment) Gentle release of any hypertonic areas within the pelvic floor musculature that may have developed due to chronic straining.

### (III) Global Musculoskeletal and Postural Correction

1.  **Postural Re-education:** Provide verbal and tactile cues to correct forward head posture, thoracic kyphosis, and anterior pelvic tilt during sitting, standing, and dynamic activities.
2.  **Flexibility and Mobility Program:**
    *   Prescribe specific stretches for tight hip flexors (e.g., kneeling lunge stretch) to address the positive Thomas test and improve lumbopelvic alignment.
    *   Incorporate thoracic spine mobility exercises (e.g., foam rolling, cat-cow) to address kyphosis and improve breathing mechanics.
3.  **Hip Strengthening:** Initiate exercises for hip external rotators and abductors (e.g., clamshells, side-lying leg raises) to improve pelvic stability.
