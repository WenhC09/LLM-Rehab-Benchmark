# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4–6 weeks)
- Improve bladder emptying efficiency and reduce post-void residual volume to <100 mL.
- Enhance pelvic floor muscle contraction strength to at least PERFECT power grade 4, endurance ≥5 seconds.
- Improve coordination between abdominal pressure generation and pelvic floor relaxation during voiding.
- Reduce episodes of stress urinary incontinence during coughing/sneezing.
- Improve patient’s posture and breathing patterns to facilitate pelvic floor and abdominal synergy.

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months)
- Restore near-normal bladder sensation and spontaneous voiding without need for intermittent catheterization.
- Maintain post-void residual consistently <50 mL.
- Achieve stable pelvic floor muscle function (PERFECT power ≥4–5, endurance ≥7–10 seconds, ≥5 repetitions).
- Eliminate or significantly reduce urinary leakage during stress maneuvers.
- Prevent progression of cystocele and improve bladder neck stability.
- Enhance quality of life, sleep, and confidence in daily activities.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Bladder Rehabilitation
1. **Timed Voiding & Double Voiding Techniques**
   - Establish individualized voiding schedule (e.g., every 2–3 hours) regardless of urge.
   - Use double voiding: after initial void, wait 1–2 minutes, then attempt again.
2. **Abdominal Facilitation**
   - Gentle manual or self-applied suprapubic pressure (Credé maneuver) during voiding, coordinated with pelvic floor relaxation.
3. **Voiding Posture Training**
   - Slight forward trunk lean, feet supported; avoid excessive straining.
4. **Intermittent Clean Catheterization (CIC)**
   - Continue as needed if PVR >150 mL, reassessed weekly.

### B. Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT)
1. **Strengthening**
   - Kegel exercises with correct technique: isolate pelvic floor without abdominal/hip compensation.
   - Begin with submaximal contractions (3–5 seconds hold, 6–8 reps, 3–4 sets/day), progressing in duration and repetitions.
2. **Coordination Training**
   - "Knack" technique: pre-contract pelvic floor before coughing/sneezing/lifting.
   - Practice relaxation during voiding to avoid functional outlet obstruction.
3. **Biofeedback-Assisted PFMT**
   - Use surface EMG or vaginal probes to provide visual feedback for contraction/relaxation patterns.
4. **Electrical Stimulation**
   - Low-frequency stimulation (20–50 Hz) for detrusor facilitation and pelvic floor strengthening, 20–30 min/session, 2–3 times/week under supervision.

### C. Postural and Core Muscle Rehabilitation
1. **Abdominal Muscle Training**
   - Gentle transverse abdominis activation exercises to address diastasis recti (2.5 cm at umbilicus).
   - Avoid high intra-abdominal pressure activities early on.
2. **Postural Correction**
   - Exercises to reduce thoracic kyphosis and anterior pelvic tilt.
   - Breathing retraining from upper chest to diaphragmatic pattern to improve core-pelvic floor synergy.

### D. Cystocele Management
- PFMT as above to provide structural support to bladder neck and anterior vaginal wall.
- Avoid heavy lifting or prolonged Valsalva maneuvers.
- Monitor prolapse stage; consider pessary fitting if symptoms worsen.

### E. Neuromodulation (if limited progress after 4–6 weeks)
- **Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS)** or **Sacral Neuromodulation (SNM)** trial to aid detrusor activation and sensory pathway recovery.

### F. Patient Education & Lifestyle Modification
- Adequate hydration (avoid excessive fluid restriction).
- Prevent constipation (fiber-rich diet, regular bowel habits).
- Avoid bladder irritants (caffeine, alcohol).
- Teach signs of urinary tract infection and when to seek care.

### G. Psychological Support
- Address anxiety/depression related to postpartum dysfunction through counseling or support groups.
- Sleep hygiene strategies to improve rest and recovery.

### H. Monitoring & Reassessment
- Weekly bladder scan for PVR tracking.
- Monthly reassessment of pelvic floor strength (PERFECT) and prolapse stage.
- Adjust program based on progress and patient feedback.
