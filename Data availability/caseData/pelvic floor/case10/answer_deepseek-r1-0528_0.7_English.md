# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (4-8 weeks):
- Improve pelvic floor muscle strength to grade 4 on Oxford Scale
- Increase pelvic floor endurance to 5-8 seconds
- Reduce post-void residual volume to <100 mL
- Achieve at least 5 effective pelvic floor muscle repetitions
- Improve abdominal wall integrity (reduce diastasis recti to <2 cm)
- Correct breathing pattern to diaphragmatic breathing
- Establish effective clean intermittent catheterization routine

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Restore volitional voiding with post-void residual <50 mL
- Eliminate stress urinary incontinence during daily activities
- Achieve pelvic floor muscle strength grade 5 with 10-second endurance
- Normalize pelvic organ support (POP-Q stage 0)
- Restore abdominopelvic coordination during functional activities
- Discontinue catheterization dependency
- Prevent progression of cystocele

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation
- **Biofeedback-assisted pelvic floor muscle training**: 3 sets of 10 contractions daily using vaginal EMG sensors, focusing on proper isolation (avoiding Valsalva)
- **Progressive resistance training**: Begin with 3-second holds (grade 3 strength), progressing to 10-second holds at maximum contraction
- **Functional coordination exercises**: Integrate pelvic floor contractions with ADLs (cough preparation, sit-to-stand transitions)
- **Electrical stimulation**: Pudendal nerve stimulation (10-20Hz frequency) for 20 minutes/day to facilitate detrusor-sphincter coordination

### Bladder Management
- **Timed voiding protocol**: Scheduled voiding every 2-3 hours with double voiding technique
- **Bladder training**: Gradual increase of voiding intervals by 15-minute increments weekly
- **Clean intermittent catheterization (CIC)**: 4-6 times/day with PVR monitoring, volume-limited to 400mL
- **Postural voiding education**: Forward-leaning position with foot support to optimize urethral angle

### Abdominal Rehabilitation
- **Diastasis recti correction**: Transverse abdominis activation with drawing-in maneuvers, progressive supine leg slides
- **Core stabilization**: Modified plank progression (knee-based), standing abdominal compressions with resistance band
- **Breathing retraining**: Diaphragmatic breathing exercises with real-time feedback (3 sets of 10 breaths, 4x/day)

### Manual Therapy
- **Perineal scar mobilization**: Cross-friction massage to episiotomy scar 5 minutes daily
- **Myofascial release**: Intra-vaginal trigger point release for levator ani tension
- **Joint mobilization**: Sacroiliac and hip capsule mobilization to address internal rotation

### Functional Training
- **Postural re-education**: Cervical retraction exercises, thoracic extension drills for kyphosis correction
- **Movement pattern training**: Hip hinge mechanics with real-time ultrasound feedback for abdominal activation
- **Cough control strategies**: Pre-contraction of pelvic floor before coughing/sneezing

### Adjunctive Therapies
- **Behavioral modification**: Fluid scheduling (1.5-2L/day), caffeine reduction, constipation prevention
- **Home exercise program**: Illustrated guide for daily pelvic floor/abdominal exercises
- **Progress monitoring**: Weekly bladder diaries, biweekly PVR measurements, monthly PERFECT reassessment
