# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4-8 weeks):
- Reduce post-void residual (PVR) volume to <100 mL.
- Improve pelvic floor muscle strength to PERFECT Power Grade 4 and Endurance ≥5 seconds.
- Enhance bladder sensation and voiding efficiency, reducing straining during micturition.
- Minimize stress urinary incontinence episodes during coughing.
- Improve abdominal muscle strength and reduce diastasis recti abdominis to <1.5 cm.
- Correct pelvic anterior tilt and posture to optimize pelvic floor function.

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve normal voiding with PVR <50 mL and no straining.
- Eliminate stress urinary incontinence during daily activities.
- Restore pelvic floor muscle function to PERFECT Power Grade 5, Endurance ≥10 seconds, and enable cough reflex.
- Resolve cystocele and stabilize bladder neck mobility.
- Maintain proper posture and core stability for sustained pelvic health.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT)
- **Kegel Exercises**: Supervised sessions to strengthen pelvic floor muscles, focusing on slow and fast contractions. Perform 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions, 3 times daily. Emphasize proper technique to ensure vaginal orifice closure and bladder neck elevation (PERFECT: target Power Grade 4, Endurance 5-7 seconds).
- **Biofeedback Therapy**: Use electromyography (EMG)-guided biofeedback (2 sessions/week, 20 minutes each) to enhance awareness of pelvic floor muscle activation and coordination. Focus on improving endurance and fast contractions.
- **Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES)**: Apply low-frequency electrical stimulation (20-50 Hz, 20 minutes, 2-3 times/week) to augment pelvic floor muscle recruitment and improve detrusor activation, addressing underactive bladder.

### Bladder Retraining
- **Scheduled Voiding**: Implement a timed voiding schedule (every 2-3 hours during the day) to promote regular bladder emptying and reduce PVR. Gradually increase intervals as voiding efficiency improves.
- **Double Voiding Technique**: Encourage patient to void, pause for 1-2 minutes, and attempt to void again to reduce residual urine.
- **Bladder Diary**: Maintain a voiding diary to monitor frequency, volume, and PVR, adjusting the schedule based on progress.

### Core and Postural Rehabilitation
- **Diastasis Recti Correction**: Initiate transverse abdominis activation exercises (e.g., abdominal drawing-in maneuver, 3 sets of 10 reps daily) to reduce diastasis recti and improve core stability.
- **Postural Correction**: Perform exercises to address forward head posture and thoracic kyphosis, including chin tucks (10 reps, 3 sets daily), scapular retraction (10 reps, 3 sets daily), and diaphragmatic breathing to correct upper chest breathing pattern.
- **Hip and Pelvic Alignment**: Stretching and strengthening for hip internal rotators (e.g., piriformis stretch, 30 seconds/side, 2-3 times daily) and Thomas test-guided hip flexor stretches to correct pelvic anterior tilt.

### Adjunct Therapies
- **Acupuncture**: Continue acupuncture (1-2 sessions/week) targeting bladder meridian points (e.g., BL23, BL28) to enhance bladder sensation and detrusor function, based on prior partial improvement.
- **Manual Therapy**: Soft tissue mobilization and myofascial release (1 session/week) to address perineal scar tissue and pelvic floor tension, improving muscle flexibility and function.

### Lifestyle and Behavioral Modifications
- **Hydration Management**: Maintain adequate fluid intake (1.5-2 L/day) while avoiding bladder irritants (e.g., caffeine, carbonated drinks) to optimize bladder function.
- **Weight Management**: Maintain current weight (52 kg) with balanced nutrition to avoid additional pelvic floor stress.
- **Patient Education**: Provide counseling on pelvic floor anatomy, voiding mechanics, and the importance of adherence to PFMT and bladder retraining. Address poor sleep quality with relaxation techniques (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation before bed).

### Monitoring and Follow-up
- **Weekly Assessments**: Monitor PVR via bladder scan and review voiding diary to track progress in bladder emptying.
- **Biweekly Evaluations**: Reassess pelvic floor muscle strength (PERFECT scale) and diastasis recti width. Adjust PFMT intensity and biofeedback parameters as needed.
- **Urodynamic Re-evaluation**: Repeat urodynamic testing at 8 weeks to assess detrusor function and voiding efficiency.
- **Pelvic Floor Ultrasound**: Reassess at 12 weeks to evaluate bladder neck mobility and cystocele status.

### Precautions
- Avoid high-impact activities (e.g., running, jumping) to prevent exacerbation of stress urinary incontinence and cystocele.
- Ensure proper catheterization technique if intermittent catheterization is needed to minimize infection risk.
- Monitor for signs of urinary tract infection recurrence, with prompt reporting of symptoms (e.g., dysuria, fever).
