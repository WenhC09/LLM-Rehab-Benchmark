# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4-8 weeks):
- Improve right lower limb muscle strength from Grade III to Grade IV.
- Enhance pelvic floor muscle strength from Grade III to Grade IV and improve voluntary contraction control.
- Reduce neurogenic bladder symptoms, aiming for improved bladder compliance and reduced residual volume to <100 mL.
- Achieve regular bowel movements with reduced reliance on glycerin enemas.
- Decrease anxiety symptoms through structured relaxation techniques and psychological support.
- Increase Modified Barthel Index score from 75 to 85, improving independence in activities of daily living (ADLs).

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve near-normal right lower limb strength (Grade IV+ to V) and functional ambulation without assistive devices.
- Restore normal bladder function, enabling spontaneous voiding without catheterization.
- Establish consistent bowel evacuation without pharmacological or manual assistance.
- Optimize pelvic floor muscle function to support continence and reduce tenderness.
- Attain full independence in ADLs (Modified Barthel Index score â‰¥90).
- Manage anxiety effectively, enabling the patient to cope with recovery challenges and resume social/vocational activities.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy
- **Lower Limb Strengthening**: 
  - Progressive resistance exercises for right lower limb (e.g., quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals) using body weight and light resistance bands, 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions, 3 times/week.
  - Functional electrical stimulation (FES) to right lower limb muscles (targeting L5-S1 innervated muscles) to enhance muscle activation, 20 minutes/session, 5 times/week.
  - Balance and coordination training (e.g., single-leg stance, weight-shifting exercises) to improve motor control, 15 minutes/session, 3 times/week.
- **Gait Training**: 
  - Assisted ambulation with a walker to promote weight-bearing and proper gait mechanics, progressing to unassisted walking as strength improves, 20-30 minutes/day.
  - Proprioceptive training (e.g., balance board exercises) to address sensory deficits in the right lower limb, 10 minutes/session, 3 times/week.

### Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation
- **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT)**: 
  - Biofeedback-assisted PFMT to improve voluntary contraction and relaxation of pelvic floor muscles, targeting puborectalis and pubococcygeus, 15 minutes/session, 4 times/week.
  - Gradual progression to functional tasks (e.g., cough, Valsalva) to enhance pelvic floor coordination.
- **Electrical Stimulation**: 
  - Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to the sacral region (S2-S4) to improve pelvic floor muscle tone and reduce tenderness, 20 minutes/session, 5 times/week.
- **Bladder and Bowel Retraining**:
  - Timed voiding schedule (every 2-3 hours) to promote bladder emptying and reduce residual volume, with gradual increase in intervals as compliance improves.
  - Bowel retraining with scheduled toileting post-meals, combined with abdominal massage to stimulate peristalsis, daily.
  - Dietary counseling to include high-fiber foods (20-25 g/day) and adequate hydration (2-2.5 L/day) to support bowel regularity.

### Occupational Therapy
- **ADL Training**: 
  - Task-specific training to improve independence in self-care (e.g., dressing, toileting), with adaptive techniques for right lower limb weakness, 30 minutes/day, 5 times/week.
  - Energy conservation techniques to manage fatigue during daily activities.
- **Assistive Device Assessment**: 
  - Evaluate need for temporary assistive devices (e.g., raised toilet seat, grab bars) to enhance safety and independence during recovery.

### Psychological Support
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: 
  - Weekly 45-minute sessions with a clinical psychologist to address anxiety, focusing on coping strategies and stress management.
- **Relaxation Techniques**: 
  - Guided diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation, 10-15 minutes/day, to reduce anxiety and improve emotional regulation.

### Medical Management Support
- **Neurogenic Bladder**:
  - Continue indwelling catheter with regular monitoring for infections; plan for intermittent catheterization training as bladder compliance improves.
  - Consider anticholinergic medication (e.g., oxybutynin 5 mg daily) to improve bladder compliance, pending urology consultation.
- **Neurogenic Bowel**:
  - Continue glycerin enemas as needed, with a goal to taper off within 4-6 weeks as bowel retraining progresses.
  - Consider stool softeners (e.g., docusate sodium 100 mg daily) to facilitate bowel movements.
- **Pain and Sensory Management**:
  - Gabapentin (300 mg tid, titrated as needed) for neuropathic pain and numbness in the right lower limb and sacrococcygeal region, with regular reassessment for efficacy and side effects.

### Monitoring and Follow-Up
- Weekly multidisciplinary team meetings (physiatrist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, psychologist, urologist) to assess progress and adjust the plan.
- Repeat cystometry and pelvic floor EMG in 6 weeks to evaluate bladder and pelvic floor function improvements.
- Monthly reassessment of Modified Barthel Index to track ADL progress.
- Regular monitoring of vital signs and neurological status to detect any complications (e.g., autonomic dysreflexia, urinary tract infections).

### Patient Education
- Educate the patient and family on the nature of spinal cord teratoma recovery, emphasizing realistic expectations and adherence to therapy.
- Provide written and verbal instructions for home exercises, bladder/bowel schedules, and dietary recommendations.
- Teach recognition of warning signs (e.g., fever, worsening numbness, or bladder retention) and when to seek medical attention.
