# **1. Rehabilitation Goals:**
## **Short-term Goals:**
Through comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation, gradually improve muscle strength and endurance in the patient's right lower limb, and promote the recovery of sensory function. Simultaneously, effectively manage bowel and bladder dysfunction, reduce dependence on assistive measures, and enhance activities of daily living (ADL).

## **Long-term Goals:**
Through systematic rehabilitation therapy, further restore impaired neurological function, strive for complete independence in ADL, achieve normal bowel function, and ultimately facilitate the patient's successful reintegration into family and community life.

# **2. Therapeutic Interventions:**
A comprehensive rehabilitation strategy addressing global support, motor function, bowel/bladder function, and psychological status has been formulated based on the patient's functional impairments:

## **Systemic Therapy:**
*   Administer Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) to improve ischemia and hypoxia at the spinal cord injury site, reduce edema, and promote nerve fiber regeneration and functional recovery.
*   Pharmacotherapy: Administer Mecobalamin for neurotrophic support, supplemented with symptomatic supportive medications such as Lactulose Oral Solution.

## **Motor Dysfunction:**
*   Primarily implement physical rehabilitation training. This includes range of motion (ROM) maintenance and expansion exercises to prevent joint stiffness and muscle atrophy.
*   Targeted strengthening and endurance training for the right lower limb to restore motor function.
*   Specific ADL training to rebuild independent living skills.

## **Core Issues - Neurogenic Bladder and Bowel Dysfunction:**
Implement a refined multimodal management protocol:

### **For Neurogenic Bladder:**
*   **Pharmacotherapy:** Neostigmine 15mg PO TID to promote detrusor contraction, increase intravesical pressure, and facilitate voiding.
*   **Bladder Training:** Instruct patient in trigger techniques to induce voiding reflex, including: Credé maneuver (manual bladder compression), Valsalva maneuver, suprapubic tapping, pubic hair traction, and inner thigh massage.
*   **Catheter Management:** Initial indwelling Foley catheter with maintenance of a closed, patent drainage system. Transitioned to Clean Intermittent Catheterization (CIC) on hospital day 3 to reduce infection risk and stimulate detrusor function recovery through cyclic filling/emptying. Concurrently, instruct patient on voiding diary documentation and voiding awareness training.
*   **Pelvic Floor Biofeedback Therapy:** Patient in semi-recumbent position. Anal/rectal probe electrodes inserted. Therapy unit transduces pelvic floor electromyography (EMG) signals into visual graphics on screen, guiding patient in learning correct pelvic floor muscle contraction and relaxation. Session duration: 30 minutes. First 15 minutes: Electrical stimulation at patient-tolerable intensity. Subsequent 15 minutes: Kegel protocol training (contraction at 50-66% maximum voluntary contraction for 10 seconds, followed by 10 seconds relaxation, repeated).
*   **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Acupuncture:** Acupuncture applied to bilateral Baliao (BL31-BL34), Shenshu (BL23), Pangguangshu (BL28), Zhongji (CV3), Shuidao (ST28), Yinlingquan (SP9), Diji (SP8), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Hegu (LI4), Taichong (LR3) points. Frequency: Once daily, 5 sessions/week, to modulate nerve and muscle function related to micturition.

### **For Neurogenic Bowel:**
*   **Pharmacotherapy:** Administer Lactulose, Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) orally. Utilize rectal laxatives (e.g., Glycerin Enema, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate Enema) PRN.
*   **Bowel Management & Lifestyle Intervention:** Nutrition service to develop individualized diet plan optimizing fiber and fluid intake for stool consistency. Establish regular bowel routine.
*   **Abdominal Massage:** Patient supine or semi-recumbent with knees flexed. Perform manual abdominal massage along colonic route (ascending → transverse → descending → sigmoid colon) using palmar pressure in forward/downward direction. Frequency: Twice daily, 5-10 minutes/session, to stimulate peristalsis.
*   **Pelvic Floor Biofeedback Therapy:** Post rectal evacuation, patient in lateral decubitus position simulates defecation. Anorectal manometry provides visual/auditory feedback of abnormal parameters, guiding corrective training via maneuvers: increased abdominal pressure, anal lift, abdominal hollowing, relaxation. Session duration: ~30 minutes. Course: 5 consecutive sessions.
*   **Pelvic Floor Myofascial Release:** Manual release of pelvic floor muscle trigger points to activate and strengthen function. Frequency: Once daily, 3 sessions/week.
*   **TCM Acupuncture:** Acupuncture applied to bilateral Baliao (BL31-BL34), Zhigou (SJ6), Zhaohai (KI6), Tianshu (ST25), Shangjuxu (ST37) points. Frequency: Once daily, 5 sessions/week, to enhance bowel sensation and peristalsis.

## **Psychological Status:**
Address mild anxiety via concurrent psychological interventions, including: Supportive Psychotherapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Psychodynamic Therapy, and Relaxation Techniques, to improve emotional state and enhance rehabilitation confidence and efficacy.
