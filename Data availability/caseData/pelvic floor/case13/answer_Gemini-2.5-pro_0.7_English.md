# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4 weeks):
1.  **Bladder Management**: Transition from indwelling catheter to a scheduled Clean Intermittent Catheterization (CIC) program, maintaining bladder volumes <500 mL to prevent overdistension and protect renal function. Achieve patient independence in performing CIC.
2.  **Bowel Management**: Establish a regular, predictable bowel program to alleviate abdominal distension and pain, and prevent fecal impaction.
3.  **Mobility**: Achieve independent bed mobility and transfers (bed to chair). Ambulate 20 meters with a walker and minimal assistance, ensuring safety.
4.  **Strength**: Improve right lower limb muscle strength from Grade 3/5 to Grade 4-/5 in key muscle groups (quadriceps, tibialis anterior, gluteals).
5.  **Pain & Discomfort**: Reduce abdominal and pelvic floor muscle tenderness through targeted interventions.
6.  **Education & Psychology**: Ensure the patient understands his condition, the rehabilitation plan, and the rationale for each intervention. Implement strategies to manage anxiety.
7.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL)**: Improve Modified Barthel Index score from 75 to >85, focusing on independence in self-care and mobility.

### Long-term goals (within 3-6 months):
1.  **Continence**: Achieve full independence in managing the established CIC and bowel program routines.
2.  **Mobility**: Progress to ambulation with the least restrictive device possible (e.g., single-point cane or no device), potentially with an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) for the right leg if foot drop persists. Achieve independent stair climbing.
3.  **Function**: Maximize functional independence in all ADLs (MBI score >95).
4.  **Community Reintegration**: Facilitate a safe return to community activities and explore vocational/educational pursuits.
5.  **Psychosocial Well-being**: Foster positive coping mechanisms and adjustment to chronic conditions, resolving the anxiety state.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### (I) Physical Therapy (PT)
*   **Kinesiotherapy**:
    *   **Right Lower Limb Strengthening**: Progressive resistance training for quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscles. Start with active-assistive and active exercises, progressing to resistance bands and weights as strength improves from Grade 3.
    *   **Neuromuscular Re-education**: Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) techniques to improve motor control and muscle activation patterns.
    *   **Balance Training**: Seated and standing balance exercises, starting with a stable surface and progressing to unstable surfaces and dynamic activities to improve postural stability.
    *   **Gait Training**: Initiate gait training in parallel bars, progressing to a walker. Focus on proper weight shifting, step length, and heel-strike on the right. Assess for the necessity of a right Ankle-Foot Orthosis (AFO) to manage potential foot drop due to L<sub>5</sub> nerve root involvement.
    *   **Transfer Training**: Practice and perfect transfers between bed, wheelchair, and toilet to ensure safety and independence.
*   **Physical Modality Therapy**:
    *   **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**: Apply to the right quadriceps and tibialis anterior muscles to augment voluntary contraction and enhance muscle strengthening.
    *   **Sensory Education**: Provide education on skin inspection and pressure relief techniques for areas with hypoesthesia (right leg, sacral region) to prevent pressure injuries.

### (II) Occupational Therapy (OT)
*   **ADL Training**:
    *   Instruction and practice in self-care activities, particularly lower body dressing and bathing, using adaptive strategies and equipment if necessary.
    *   Energy conservation techniques.
*   **Bladder & Bowel Program Training**:
    *   Provide hands-on training for the patient to master the Clean Intermittent Catheterization technique.
    *   Establish and reinforce the daily routine for the bowel program (timing, positioning, supplies).
*   **Home Environment Assessment**: Plan for a home visit or simulated assessment to recommend necessary modifications (e.g., grab bars, shower chair) to ensure a safe discharge environment.

### (III) Bladder Rehabilitation
*   **Immediate Action**: Discontinue the indwelling urinary catheter.
*   **Program**: Initiate **Clean Intermittent Catheterization (CIC)** on a timed schedule (e.g., every 4 hours initially).
    *   *Rationale*: Urodynamics show an acontractile detrusor with preserved sensation. CIC is the gold standard for emptying the bladder safely in this scenario. The patient's preserved sensation is a significant advantage for recognizing bladder fullness and adhering to the schedule.
*   **Monitoring**: Record fluid intake and CIC volumes to adjust the schedule, aiming to keep catheterized volumes between 300-450 mL.
*   **Education**: Instruct on fluid management (aiming for 1.5-2L of non-caffeinated fluids daily) and signs/symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI).

### (IV) Bowel Rehabilitation
*   **Initial Management**: Address current abdominal distension with prescribed enemas or manual evacuation as needed.
*   **Bowel Program**: Implement a structured daily program consisting of:
    1.  **Timing**: Perform program at the same time each day, preferably 20-30 minutes after a meal (e.g., breakfast) to utilize the gastrocolic reflex.
    2.  **Diet**: High-fiber diet and adequate fluid intake.
    3.  **Medication**: Start a stool softener (e.g., docusate sodium) and use a chemical stimulant (e.g., bisacodyl suppository) to initiate defecation.
    4.  **Positioning**: Ensure the patient is sitting upright on a toilet or commode.
    5.  **Technique**: Teach abdominal massage (clockwise) to promote colonic transit.

### (V) Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation
*   **Manual Therapy**: Gentle myofascial release and trigger point therapy for the tender puborectalis and pubococcygeus muscles to decrease pain and resting tension.
*   **Biofeedback**:
    *   Initially use surface EMG biofeedback for **down-training**, teaching the patient to consciously relax the pelvic floor muscles to address the increased resting tension.
    *   Once relaxation is achieved, transition to biofeedback for **strengthening exercises (Kegels)** to improve the Grade 3 muscle strength and voluntary sphincter contraction.
*   **Coordination Training**: Teach coordination of pelvic floor relaxation during attempts at urination and defecation.

### (VI) Psychological Intervention
*   **Patient Education**: Provide comprehensive education about the spinal cord injury, neurogenic bladder/bowel, and the potential for functional recovery. A clear understanding of the plan can significantly reduce anxiety.
*   **Counseling**: Schedule regular sessions with a rehabilitation psychologist or counselor to address the anxiety diagnosis, develop coping strategies, and support emotional adjustment.
*   **Goal Setting**: Involve the patient actively in setting weekly functional goals to foster a sense of control and accomplishment.
