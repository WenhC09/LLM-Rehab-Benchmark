# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Improve muscle strength in the right lower limb to at least Grade 4.
- Enhance sensory perception in the right lower limb and pelvic region.
- Establish a regular bowel and bladder routine to manage neurogenic bowel and bladder dysfunction.
- Reduce abdominal distension and pain through appropriate interventions.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve independence in activities of daily living (ADL) with a Modified Barthel Index score of 90 or above.
- Restore normal bladder and bowel function.
- Improve overall mobility and functional capacity to facilitate return to pre-surgery lifestyle.
- Address anxiety and promote psychological well-being through supportive therapies.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### Physical Rehabilitation:
- **Strengthening Exercises**: Focus on progressive resistance training for the right lower limb, targeting key muscle groups to improve strength and function.
- **Sensory Re-education**: Implement sensory stimulation techniques to enhance proprioception and tactile sensation in the right lower limb.
- **Functional Training**: Incorporate gait training and balance exercises to improve mobility and stability.

### Neuromuscular Re-education:
- **Electrical Stimulation**: Use neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to facilitate muscle contraction in the right lower limb and improve muscle tone.
- **Biofeedback**: Employ biofeedback techniques for pelvic floor muscle training to enhance awareness and control of pelvic floor muscles.

### Bladder and Bowel Management:
- **Scheduled Voiding Program**: Establish a timed voiding schedule to promote regular bladder emptying and reduce urinary retention.
- **Bowel Training**: Implement a bowel management program, including dietary modifications and scheduled glycerin enemas, to improve bowel function.

### Pain Management:
- **Medication**: Administer analgesics as needed to manage abdominal pain and discomfort.
- **Therapeutic Modalities**: Utilize heat therapy and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain relief and muscle relaxation.

### Psychological Support:
- **Counseling**: Provide psychological support and counseling to address anxiety and emotional well-being.
- **Support Groups**: Encourage participation in support groups for individuals with similar conditions to foster social interaction and emotional support.

### Monitoring and Evaluation:
- Regularly assess progress towards rehabilitation goals through standardized assessments and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.
- Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team, including physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and psychologists, to ensure comprehensive care.
