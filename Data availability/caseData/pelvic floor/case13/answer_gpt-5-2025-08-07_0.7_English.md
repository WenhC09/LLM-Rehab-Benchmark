# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks)
- Improve right lower limb muscle strength from Grade III toward Grade IV.
- Enhance sensation below T12 dermatome on the right side to improve proprioceptive feedback.
- Reduce abdominal distension and improve bowel movement frequency/efficiency through bowel management.
- Establish an effective, low-residual urine bladder emptying routine to reduce infection risk and maintain continence.
- Reduce pelvic floor muscle tenderness and normalize resting tone.
- Improve ADL score from 75 toward ≥85 with assistance.
- Alleviate anxiety through education and psychological support.

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months)
- Achieve functional ambulation without assistive devices or with minimal aid.
- Restore right lower limb muscle strength to Grade V if possible.
- Improve bladder function toward volitional urination with minimal catheter use.
- Achieve regular, self-managed bowel evacuation without significant abdominal discomfort.
- Normalize pelvic floor muscle strength and sensation to improve continence.
- Attain independence in ADL (Modified Barthel Index ≥95).
- Maintain psychological well-being and reintegration into study/work.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 Physical Therapy
- **Lower Limb Strengthening**: 
  - Progressive resistance exercises for right lower limb key muscle groups (hip flexors/extensors, knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexors/plantarflexors).
  - Initiate with isometric contractions progressing to isotonic and functional closed-chain exercises.
- **Gait Training**:
  - Parallel bar standing and weight shifting.
  - Assisted walking with appropriate orthosis if needed (e.g., ankle-foot orthosis for foot drop if present).
  - Incorporate proprioceptive training and balance board exercises.
- **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**:
  - Applied to weakened right lower limb muscles to promote motor unit recruitment.

### 2.2 Occupational Therapy
- **ADL Retraining**:
  - Practice transfers, dressing, grooming, and toileting with adaptive techniques.
  - Energy conservation strategies.
- **Lower Limb Functional Integration**:
  - Task-specific training for community mobility and vocational activities.

### 2.3 Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation
- **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training**:
  - Biofeedback-guided Kegel exercises to improve voluntary contraction and relaxation.
  - Emphasis on reducing resting tone and increasing squeeze strength.
- **Myofascial Release & Stretching**:
  - Manual therapy to reduce tenderness in puborectalis/pubococcygeus muscles.
- **Electrical Stimulation**:
  - Low-frequency stimulation to facilitate pelvic floor muscle recruitment and sensory feedback.

### 2.4 Bladder Management
- **Intermittent Catheterization**:
  - Transition from indwelling catheter to clean intermittent self-catheterization (CIC) as tolerated.
- **Timed Voiding Program**:
  - Based on urodynamic findings (normal sensation, reduced compliance) to prevent overdistension.
- **Fluid Intake Regulation**:
  - Adequate hydration, avoid bladder irritants (caffeine, alcohol).

### 2.5 Bowel Management
- **Scheduled Evacuation**:
  - Establish a regular bowel routine post-meal to utilize gastrocolic reflex.
- **Dietary Modification**:
  - High-fiber diet, adequate fluid intake.
- **Assistive Measures**:
  - Digital stimulation or suppositories as needed.
- **Pelvic Floor Coordination**:
  - Training for relaxation during evacuation.

### 2.6 Pain and Spasticity Management
- Monitor for neuropathic pain; consider TENS or pharmacological management if needed.
- Monitor muscle tone; currently increased pelvic floor tone but no significant limb spasticity—apply stretching as preventive measure.

### 2.7 Psychological Support
- **Counseling**:
  - Address anxiety related to functional limitations.
- **Patient Education**:
  - Understanding of condition, prognosis, and active role in rehabilitation.

### 2.8 Assistive Devices
- Provision of walking aids (cane, walker) as temporary support during gait retraining.
- Orthotic assessment if persistent weakness in ankle dorsiflexion or knee instability.

### 2.9 Monitoring & Reassessment
- **Weekly Review**:
  - Muscle strength grading, sensory testing.
- **Monthly Functional Assessment**:
  - Modified Barthel Index, gait analysis.
- **Urodynamic Re-evaluation**:
  - At 3 months or earlier if bladder symptoms change.
- **EMG Follow-up**:
  - To monitor nerve recovery.

**Precautions**:
- Avoid overexertion of weak muscles to prevent fatigue-induced inhibition.
- Maintain skin integrity, especially in hypoesthetic areas.
- Prevent urinary tract infections during bladder training.
