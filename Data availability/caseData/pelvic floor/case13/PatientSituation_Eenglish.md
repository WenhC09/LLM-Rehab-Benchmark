# Medical Record Summary

## (I) History of Present Illness

**Patient Information**: Male, 22 years old.

**Chief Complaint**: Weakness and numbness in the right lower limb with difficulty defecating for 17 days post-spinal tumor surgery.

**Present Illness**: The patient presented to our outpatient clinic on December 2, 2023, for "low back pain with lower limb weakness." Lumbar MRI revealed "spinal canal occupying lesion at T<sub>12</sub>-L<sub>2</sub> vertebral levels." Admitted to Neurosurgery under the diagnosis of "intra/extradural space-occupying lesion." Preoperative evaluations excluded surgical contraindications. The patient underwent "Spinal Cord Lesion Excision" under general anesthesia. Postoperative management included hemostasis, gastric acid suppression, and anti-infection therapy (Cefuroxime 1.5g IV q8h). Seventeen days ago, he developed bilateral lower limb weakness, numbness, and dyschezia. Interventions (indwelling urinary catheter, glycerin enema) showed poor efficacy. Subsequent rehabilitation at an external hospital (hyperbaric oxygen therapy ×3 sessions, electrotherapy, kinesiotherapy) provided no symptomatic relief. Current symptoms: right lower limb weakness/numbness, abdominal distension/pain, and difficulty with bladder/bowel evacuation. No chills, fever, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, or limb convulsions. Admitted to our department for further management under "Postoperative Recovery Phase of Spinal Cord Teratoma." Since onset: conscious, alert, normal diet/sleep, indwelling urinary catheter, dyschezia, no significant weight change.

**Past Medical History**: No smoking or alcohol use. Denies family history of genetic disorders or similar diseases.

## (II) Physical Examination

*   **Vital Signs**: Temp 36.8°C, Pulse 106 bpm, Resp 20 breaths/min, BP 127/78 mmHg.
*   **General Condition**: Conscious, alert, coherent, cooperative. Supple neck. Clear lung sounds bilaterally, no significant dry/crepitations. Regular heart rhythm. Abdomen distended with tenderness, no rebound tenderness. No lower limb edema.
*   **Neurological Examination**:
    *   **Sensation**: Hypoesthesia below right T<sub>12</sub> dermatome. Normal sensation on left side. Sacrococcygeal hypoesthesia.
    *   **Muscle Strength & Tone**: Normal strength and tone in bilateral upper limbs. Right lower limb key muscle strength: Grade III.
    *   **Reflexes**: Decreased bulbocavernosus reflex. Absent right patellar reflex. Diminished right Achilles reflex.
    *   **Pelvic Floor Assessment**: Digital rectal exam reveals tenderness. Tenderness in puborectalis/pubococcygeus muscles. Increased resting pelvic floor tone. Decreased anal sphincter tone and voluntary contraction strength during squeeze. Pelvic floor muscle strength: Grade III. Reduced pelvic floor sensation.
*   **Functional Assessment**: Modified Barthel Index Score: 75.

## (III) Auxiliary Examinations

*   **Lumbar MRI Plain Scan**: Space-occupying lesion in spinal canal at T<sub>12</sub>-L<sub>2</sub> levels, contrast-enhanced MRI recommended. Loss of lumbar lordosis. Correlate clinically.
*   **Electrophysiological Study for Lumbosacral Plexopathy (Sciatic Nerve, Unilateral)**: Electromyography (EMG) findings suggestive of chronic bilateral L<sub>5</sub>, S<sub>1</sub> nerve root injury. Correlate clinically.

## (IV) Diagnosis

*   Postoperative Recovery Phase of Spinal Cord Teratoma
*   Incomplete Right Lower Limb Monoparesis
*   Neurogenic Bladder
*   Neurogenic Bowel
*   Anxiety State
*   Impaired Activities of Daily Living (ADL)

## (V) Pre-Rehabilitation Assessments Post-Admission

Post-admission assessments:
1.  **Cystometry**: Pre-test BP 148/97 mmHg.
    *   Bladder Volume 100 mL, Pressure 13 cmH<sub>2</sub>O;
    *   Bladder Volume 200 mL, Pressure 16 cmH<sub>2</sub>O;
    *   Bladder Volume 300 mL, Pressure 18 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (urge sensation), BP 134/74 mmHg;
    *   Bladder Volume 400 mL, Pressure 16 cmH<sub>2</sub>O;
    *   Bladder Volume 500 mL, Pressure 14 cmH<sub>2</sub>O (strong urge sensation), BP 128/71 mmHg. Test terminated.
2.  **Pelvic Floor Ultrasound**: No significant abnormalities detected.
3.  **Urodynamic Study**: Stable detrusor muscle. No significant detrusor contraction during voiding phase. Reduced bladder compliance. Normal cystometric capacity. Normal bladder sensation.
4.  **Lumbosacral Plexopathy + External Anal Sphincter EMG**: EMG findings consistent with bilateral L<sub>5</sub>, S<sub>1</sub> nerve root injury, showing no significant improvement compared to previous EMG. External anal sphincter EMG: No significant abnormalities.
