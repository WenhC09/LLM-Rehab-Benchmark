# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (4-8 weeks):
- Improve right lower limb strength from grade 3 to 3+/4
- Establish effective bladder management program
- Implement structured bowel regimen to reduce abdominal distension/pain
- Enhance pelvic floor muscle strength to grade 4
- Increase Modified Barthel Index to ≥85 points
- Reduce pelvic floor hypertonicity through relaxation techniques
- Educate on autonomic dysreflexia management

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve functional ambulation with single-point cane
- Attain bladder continence via intermittent catheterization
- Establish regular bowel evacuation program without enemas
- Restore independent ADL performance (Barthel Index ≥95)
- Optimize pelvic floor function for continence
- Enable community reintegration with vocational assessment

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Neuromotor Rehabilitation
- **Progressive resistance training**: Concentric-focused exercises for right LE (quadriceps, tibialis anterior, gluteals)
- **Gait training**: Parallel bar exercises → progressed to walker-assisted ambulation
- **Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation**: Rhythmic initiation techniques for right LE
- **Aquatic therapy**: Partial weight-bearing exercises in pool

### Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation
- **Biofeedback therapy**: 3x/week for pelvic floor muscle re-education
- **Manual therapy**: Myofascial release for hypertonic puborectalis/pubococcygeus
- **Electrostimulation**: Transrectal/interferential current for sphincter coordination
- **Kegel protocol**: Progressive pelvic floor strengthening program

### Neurogenic Bladder Management
- **Structured catheterization**: Clean intermittent catheterization q4-6h (based on cystometry)
- **Bladder training**: Scheduled voiding trials with Credé/Valsalva maneuvers
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Consider α-blockers if sphincter dyssynergia confirmed
- **Hydration protocol**: Regulated fluid intake (1.5-2L/day)

### Neurogenic Bowel Management
- **Bowel retraining**: Digital stimulation + suppository use 30min post-prandial
- **Abdominal massage**: Clockwise colonic massage BID
- **Dietary modification**: Fiber optimization (15-20g/day) + osmotic agents
- **Positioning training**: Toileting with optimal hip flexion (90°)

### Functional Training
- **ADL adaptation**: Energy conservation techniques + assistive devices
- **Transfer training**: Sit-to-stand with progressive resistance
- **Wheelchair skills**: Pressure management + propulsion techniques

### Adjunctive Therapies
- **Anxiety management**: CBT + relaxation breathing
- **Sensory re-education**: Texture discrimination training for sacral dermatomes
- **Modalities**: TENS for pain control; contraindicate heat near surgical site
- **Education**: Autonomic dysreflexia recognition (BP monitoring)
