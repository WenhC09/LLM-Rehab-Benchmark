## Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

**Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks):**
- Reduce stool frequency to <10 times/day with improved ability to defer defecation.
- Decrease perianal pain post-defecation from VAS 7 to ≤4.
- Improve sleep quality with PSQI <12 by reducing nocturnal incontinence episodes and enhancing sleep initiation.
- Increase anal function score by ≥1–2 points through targeted pelvic floor training.
- Stabilize nutritional status and prevent further weight loss; improve appetite and oral intake.
- Alleviate anxiety and depressive symptoms (SAS/SDS reduction by ≥5 points each).
- Enhance overall daily activity tolerance and reduce fatigue.

**Long-term goals (within 3–6 months):**
- Achieve socially acceptable continence (LARS score improvement from 32 to ≤20; anal function score ≥6).
- Maintain stool frequency at ≤5–6/day with minimal urgency and nocturnal symptoms.
- Reduce perianal pain to VAS ≤2, minimal impact on daily activities.
- Restore satisfactory sleep quality (PSQI ≤7) with uninterrupted sleep ≥5–6 hours.
- Maintain adequate nutritional status with stable or improved weight and serum albumin.
- Achieve stable psychological state with mild or no anxiety/depression (SAS/SDS <50).
- Regain partial to full participation in social activities with improved quality of life.

### 2. Treatment Methods

**A. Bowel Function Rehabilitation**
1. **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT) / Biofeedback Therapy**
   - Initiate Kegel-type exercises under therapist guidance, 3–5 sessions/week.
   - Biofeedback-assisted anal sphincter training to enhance external sphincter strength and coordination.
   - Gradual progression of contraction duration and intensity.

2. **Rectal Sensory Training**
   - Balloon catheter sensory training to improve rectal compliance and sensation threshold.
   - Conduct 2–3 times/week in physiotherapy setting.

3. **Bowel Habit and Scheduling**
   - Establish fixed defecation times, preferably after meals.
   - Utilize gentle abdominal massage to promote colonic transit.

4. **Dietary Modification**
   - Low-residue, low-fat diet initially; gradual reintroduction of soluble fiber to improve stool consistency.
   - Avoid known irritants (caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, lactose if intolerant).
   - Adequate hydration but limit fluid intake in the 2–3 hours before bedtime.

5. **Medication Support (to be coordinated with oncology and gastroenterology)**
   - Consider loperamide or other antidiarrheal agents for stool control.
   - Stool bulking agents (psyllium husk) as tolerated.

---

**B. Pain Management**
1. **Local Care**
   - Warm sitz baths 2–3 times/day with mild antiseptic.
   - Protective barrier creams to reduce perianal skin irritation.

2. **Pharmacologic**
   - Topical anesthetic ointments before/after defecation.
   - Stepwise analgesic regimen per WHO pain ladder, avoiding constipation-inducing agents where possible.

3. **Physical Modalities**
   - Low-level laser therapy or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for perianal pain if available.

---

**C. Sleep Disorder Management**
1. **Sleep Hygiene Education**
   - Fixed sleep/wake schedule.
   - Avoid stimulants in the evening.
   - Relaxation techniques (breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation) before bedtime.

2. **Nocturnal Incontinence Reduction**
   - Adjust antidiarrheal timing to cover nighttime.
   - Limit evening fluid and trigger food intake.

3. **Pharmacological Support**
   - Short-term use of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics or melatonin as clinically indicated.

---

**D. Nutritional Support**
1. **Dietary Counseling**
   - High-protein, high-calorie, easily digestible diet.
   - Small, frequent meals to reduce postprandial urgency.
   - Oral nutritional supplements if oral intake insufficient.

2. **Monitoring**
   - Weekly weight, monthly serum albumin and prealbumin checks.

---

**E. Psychological Support**
1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**
   - Address maladaptive thoughts related to incontinence and cancer prognosis.

2. **Relaxation and Coping Skills Training**
   - Guided imagery, mindfulness meditation.

3. **Pharmacological Treatment**
   - Antidepressants or anxiolytics as indicated and tolerated.

4. **Social Support**
   - Family counseling, patient support group referral.

---

**F. General Physical Conditioning**
1. **Low-Intensity Aerobic Exercise**
   - Walking or stationary cycling 15–20 min/day as tolerated to improve fatigue and mood.
   
2. **Strengthening Exercises**
   - Focus on core and lower limb strength to improve pelvic stability.

---

**G. Interdisciplinary Coordination**
- Close collaboration with oncology, gastroenterology, nutrition, psychology, and nursing teams.
- Regular reassessment every 2–4 weeks to adjust plan based on progress.
