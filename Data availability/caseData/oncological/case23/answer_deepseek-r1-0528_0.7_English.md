### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan  

#### 1. Rehabilitation Goals  
**Short-term goals (0-4 weeks):**  
- Reduce daily fecal incontinence episodes from 15-20 to ≤10 times.  
- Decrease perianal pain from VAS 7 to ≤4.  
- Improve sleep quality by reducing PSQI score from 18 to ≤12.  
- Address malnutrition via oral intake optimization.  
- Mitigate anxiety/depression symptoms (target SDS ≤58, SAS ≤60).  

**Long-term goals (3-6 months):**  
- Achieve socially manageable bowel function (≤5 incontinence episodes/day).  
- Restore independent sleep continuity (PSQI ≤8).  
- Normalize nutritional status (albumin/prealbumin within reference range).  
- Enable return to basic social activities.  

#### 2. Treatment Methods  
**A. Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation**  
- *Biofeedback Therapy:* 20-minute sessions 3×/week to enhance anal sphincter control, utilizing EMG-guided pelvic floor muscle training.  
- *Bowel Retraining Protocol:* Structured defecation scheduling (every 2 hours initially) with gradual extension intervals.  
- *Electrical Stimulation:* Low-frequency (10-20Hz) transanal neuromodulation to improve rectal sensitivity.  

**B. Pain & Symptom Management**  
- *Topical Analgesia:* 5% lidocaine ointment applied pre/post-defecation for perianal pain.  
- *Sitz Bath Protocol:* Warm water immersion 15 minutes 3×/day post-defecation.  
- *Antidiarrheal Strategy:* Loperamide titration (start 2mg pre-meals) with stool consistency monitoring.  

**C. Sleep & Psychological Intervention**  
- *Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I):* Sleep restriction (4-hour initial window) + stimulus control.  
- *Relaxation Training:* Daily diaphragmatic breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation.  
- *Psychoeducation:* Group sessions addressing cancer-related distress twice weekly.  

**D. Nutritional Optimization**  
- *High-Protein Supplementation:* Whey-based oral nutritional supplements (30g protein/day) divided into 6 doses.  
- *Soluble Fiber Protocol:* Psyllium husk (3.5g BID) to improve stool consistency.  
- *Hydration Management:* Isotonic electrolyte solutions (1.5L/day) between meals.  

**E. Activity Modulation**  
- *Energy Conservation Training:* Paced daily activity scheduling with mandatory rest periods.  
- *Low-Impact Aerobic Conditioning:* Supine cycling 10 minutes BID, intensity titrated to Borg RPE ≤12/20.  
- *Chemotherapy Adaptation Protocol:* Pre-infusion hydration + post-infusion graded positioning exercises.  

**F. Adjunctive Supports**  
- *Skin Integrity Protocol:* pH-balanced perianal cleansing + zinc oxide barrier cream after each incontinence episode.  
- *Environmental Modification:* Bedside commode placement + moisture-wicking bedding systems.  
- *Caregiver Education:* Training on bowel diary documentation and loperamide administration.
