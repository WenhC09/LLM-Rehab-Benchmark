### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

**1. Rehabilitation Goals:**

*   **Short-term goals (within 4-6 weeks):**
    *   **Bowel Function:** Reduce the frequency of fecal incontinence episodes by 30-50%, especially nocturnal episodes, to improve sleep continuity.
    *   **Pain Management:** Reduce post-defecation perianal pain VAS score from 7 to ≤ 4.
    *   **Sleep Quality:** Improve sleep initiation and reduce daytime dysfunction, aiming for a PSQI score reduction of at least 5 points.
    *   **Psychological State:** Alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression, aiming for a reduction in SAS and SDS scores.
    *   **Nutrition & Fatigue:** Improve appetite and nutritional intake, and establish an energy conservation strategy to manage fatigue.
    *   **Education:** Ensure the patient understands the principles of Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) management and can independently perform perianal skin care.

*   **Long-term goals (within 3-6 months):**
    *   **Bowel Function:** Achieve predictable bowel movements and reduce incontinence frequency to a manageable level (< 5 times/day), significantly improving quality of life and enabling limited social activities. Aim to improve the LARS score to the moderate or minor category (<30 points).
    *   **Functional Independence:** Restore confidence in managing bowel function, reduce reliance on protective pads, and minimize the impact of symptoms on daily life.
    *   **Pain Management:** Achieve sustained control of perianal pain (VAS ≤ 2).
    *   **Psychological Well-being:** Establish effective coping mechanisms for chronic illness, anxiety, and depression, improving overall mood and outlook.
    *   **Physical Condition:** Improve overall physical stamina and reduce the impact of cancer-related fatigue.

**2. Treatment Methods:**

A multi-faceted, patient-centered approach is required, prioritizing symptom control and quality of life given the patient's metastatic disease, age, and severe functional impairment.

*   **Bowel Function Rehabilitation:**
    *   **Patient Education:** Detailed explanation of LARS, its causes (surgery, radiotherapy), and the goals of rehabilitation. Emphasize that the goal is management and control, not necessarily a complete cure, to set realistic expectations.
    *   **Dietary and Fluid Management:**
        *   Referral to a clinical dietitian.
        *   Implement a low-residue, high-fiber (soluble fiber like psyllium husk) diet to improve stool consistency and form.
        *   Advise small, frequent meals to avoid overwhelming the neorectum.
        *   Identify and eliminate trigger foods (e.g., caffeine, spicy foods, high-fat foods, excessive dairy).
        *   Maintain adequate hydration but advise timing fluid intake to avoid exacerbating nocturnal incontinence.
    *   **Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation:**
        *   **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT):** Initiate a gentle, supervised PFMT program focusing on sphincter contraction, endurance holds, and coordination with abdominal muscles. Given the patient's fatigue, sessions should be short and frequent.
        *   **Biofeedback Therapy:** Utilize anorectal biofeedback to improve the patient's sensory awareness of rectal filling and motor control of the external anal sphincter. Visual feedback can enhance learning and engagement.
        *   **Transcutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TTNS):** A non-invasive neuromodulation technique to be performed 30 minutes daily to help regulate sacral nerve reflexes controlling bowel function.
    *   **Bowel Retraining Program:**
        *   Encourage establishing a regular time for defecation, ideally 20-30 minutes after a meal, to utilize the gastrocolic reflex.
        *   Teach techniques for complete rectal emptying to reduce stool fragmentation and frequency.

*   **Pain Management:**
    *   **Perianal Skin Care:** Instruct on meticulous hygiene. Use a squirt bottle with warm water for cleansing instead of wiping. Pat dry gently. Apply a zinc-oxide-based barrier cream after each bowel movement to protect the skin from irritation.
    *   **Sitz Baths:** Recommend warm (not hot) sitz baths for 10-15 minutes, 2-3 times daily and after bowel movements, to soothe irritated tissues and relieve pain.
    *   **Pharmacological Intervention:** In consultation with the primary medical team, consider topical anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine cream) for short-term relief.

*   **Nutritional Support:**
    *   **Dietary Fortification:** Based on dietitian recommendations, fortify meals to increase protein and caloric content without increasing volume.
    *   **Oral Nutritional Supplements:** Prescribe high-protein, high-calorie supplements to be taken between meals to address hypoproteinemia and anorexia.

*   **Psychological and Sleep Intervention:**
    *   **Psychological Counseling:** Initiate regular sessions with a psychologist or psychiatrist to address the diagnosed anxiety and depression using supportive psychotherapy and/or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).
    *   **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide structured guidance on establishing a consistent sleep-wake cycle, creating a comfortable sleep environment, and developing a relaxing pre-sleep routine. Advise avoiding screen time and stimulants before bed.
    *   **Relaxation Techniques:** Teach diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation to manage anxiety, reduce pain perception, and facilitate sleep onset.

*   **General Physical Conditioning:**
    *   **Energy Conservation Techniques:** Educate the patient on activity pacing, prioritizing tasks, and incorporating rest periods throughout the day to manage severe fatigue.
    *   **Graded Exercise Program:** Initiate a very gentle exercise regimen consisting of seated exercises, gentle stretching, and short, slow walks as tolerated. The goal is to counteract deconditioning and improve mood and energy levels, not to cause further exhaustion. The program will be advanced very gradually based on the patient's tolerance.
