### Case Summary

**Basic Information:** 77-year-old male patient.

**Chief Complaint:** Postoperative colorectal cancer for over 4 years, fecal incontinence for 3 years.

**Present Illness:** The patient underwent laparoscopic Dixon procedure for rectal cancer in January 2020. Postoperatively, he developed increased stool frequency (10-15 times daily) with loose, unformed stools. From late April to mid-May 2020, he received 28 fractions of radiotherapy, during which fecal incontinence gradually developed and was particularly severe at night, significantly disturbing sleep. Subsequent chemotherapy for disease progression (liver metastasis) was frequently interrupted due to adverse reactions (severe myelosuppression) and severe gastrointestinal dysfunction.

At admission, chronic bowel dysfunction and post-defecation perianal pain severely impacted daily living and sleep, with complete loss of social engagement capacity. The patient also suffered physical and psychological burdens from chemotherapy-related adverse effects. Currently alert but lethargic, fatigued, and anorexic. Experiences fecal incontinence 15-20 times daily with small-volume stools, accompanied by perianal pain after defecation and poor nocturnal sleep.

**Past Medical History:** Denies chronic conditions including hypertension and diabetes.

**Physical Examination:** A 10cm surgical scar visible on the abdomen. Abdomen flat and symmetrical without visible venous patterns or peristaltic waves. Abdominal wall soft. No tenderness, rebound tenderness, or palpable masses throughout the abdomen. Liver and spleen not palpable below the costal margin.

**Admission Diagnosis:**
1.  Rectal Malignancy (Severe Anterior Resection Syndrome)
2.  Secondary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver
3.  Anxiety State
4.  Sleep Disorder
5.  Hypoproteinemia

### Pre-Rehabilitation Quantitative Assessments

The following assessments were conducted prior to rehabilitation:

*   **Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) Score:** 32 points (severe LARS).
*   **Anal Function Assessment (Xu Zhongfa's 5-item 10-point scoring system):** Total score <4 points (fecal continence: 1 point; defecation frequency: 0 points), indicating severely impaired anal function.
*   **Pain Assessment (Visual Analog Scale, VAS):** 7 points, reflecting moderate-to-severe persistent perianal pain and distension after defecation.
*   **Sleep Quality Assessment (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI):** 18 points, indicating sleep disorder with significant difficulties in sleep initiation and daytime dysfunction.
*   **Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS-2002):** Moderate nutritional impairment.
*   **Depression Assessment (Self-Rating Depression Scale, SDS):** 65 points (moderate depression).
*   **Anxiety Assessment (Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, SAS):** 66 points (moderate anxiety).
