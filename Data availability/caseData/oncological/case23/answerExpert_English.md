## **1. Rehabilitation Goals**

### **Short-term Goals (within 3 weeks):**
*   Improve anal continence, alleviate anal tenesmus, and relieve perianal pain after defecation.
*   Enhance sleep quality, reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms, and correct malnutrition.

### **Long-term Goals (within 6 weeks):**
*   Reduce Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) score to 21-29 points (moderate) and Wexner Fecal Incontinence Score to 4 points.
*   Improve quality of life:
    *   Reduce Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score to 10 points,
    *   Restore normal social function, with Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) score below 53 points and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) score below 50 points.
*   Achieve and maintain normal nutritional status.

## **2. Treatment Methods**

### **(1) Pelvic Floor Muscle Training**
Instruct patient in a modified pelvic floor exercise: "Abdominal Breathing Combined with Leg-Crossed Anal Lift Exercise". Specific protocol:
1.  Patient assumes standing or supine position with whole body relaxed.
2.  During nasal inhalation, relax the diaphragm allowing abdominal descent, while simultaneously engaging thigh and gluteal muscles to tighten the perineum.
3.  Then, while simulating the sensation of controlling defecation, contract and elevate the perianal muscles. Maintain contraction for 5 seconds, followed by slow relaxation for 10 seconds.
4.  Repeat this sequence 5 times per set. Perform 5 sets daily, adhering to the principle of progressive overload.

### **(2) Herbal Sitz Bath Combined with Moxibustion and Oral Herbal Decoction**
Employ integrated internal and external herbal therapy to alleviate chronic post-defecation perianal distension and pain.
*   **Herbal Sitz Bath:** Use decoction concentrated from *Cortex Phellodendri* (Huáng Bǎi), *Flos Lonicerae Japonicae* (Jīn Yín Huā), *Fructus Forsythiae* (Lián Qiào), and *Herba Taraxaci* (Pú Gōng Yīng). Dilute with 1000 ml warm water for sitz bath. Duration: 10-15 minutes per session. Frequency: 5 times weekly for 2 consecutive weeks.
*   **Moxibustion Therapy:** Apply mild-warm moxibustion with moxa sticks to bilateral ST36 (Zusanli), CV4 (Guānyuán), and CV8 (Shénquè) acupoints. Duration: 20 minutes per acupoint. Frequency: Once daily for 2 consecutive weeks.
*   **Oral Herbal Decoction:** Physician-prescribed decoction based on syndrome differentiation following the principle of "simultaneously regulating spleen and kidney, tonifying spleen and soothing liver" (Pí Shèn Tóng Tiáo, Bǔ Pí Shū Gān). Frequency: Once daily for 2 consecutive weeks.

### **(3) Transanal Irrigation**
Instruct patient in transanal irrigation to achieve regular rectal emptying and improve continence.
*   **Timing:** Perform 2 hours before or after meals to prevent adverse effects like nausea.
*   **Procedure:** Fill irrigation bag with 800 ml warm water. After anal sphincter relaxation, slowly insert catheter into rectum. Inflate balloon slowly to secure catheter. Slowly infuse water into bowel using manual pump. After infusion, deflate balloon and remove catheter. Instruct patient to retain fluid for approximately 5-8 minutes before expelling stool.
*   **Frequency:** Perform 1-2 times daily. An additional session before bedtime is recommended to ensure nighttime sleep quality.
