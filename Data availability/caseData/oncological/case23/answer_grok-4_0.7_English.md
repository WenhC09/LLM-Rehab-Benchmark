## Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-term Goals (1-3 months):
- Reduce fecal incontinence episodes to 8-10 times daily.
- Decrease LARS score 20-25 points (moderate LARS).
- Reduce perianal pain (VAS score) to 3-4 points.
- Improve sleep quality (PSQI score <12).
- Enhance nutritional status to reduce NRS-2002 score to minimal risk.
- Reduce anxiety and depression scores (SAS and SDS <50).

#### Long-term Goals (3-12 months):
 Achieve fecal continence for at least 50% of defecation episodes (continence score ≥3 on Xu Zhongfa’s scale).
- Further reduce LARS score to <20 points (mild or no LARS).
- Maintain perianal pain at VAS score ≤2.
- Achieve normal sleep quality (PSQI score ≤5).
- Restore nutritional status to normal and maintain stable body weight.
- Normalize psychological status (SAS and SDS scores <40).
- Regain partial social engagement capacity.

### 2. Treatment Methods

#### Bowel Dysfunction and Fecal Incontinence Management
- **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT):** 
  - Initiate biofeedback-assisted pelvic floor exercises, 3 sessions/week (30 minutes/session) under physiotherapist supervision to strengthen anal sphincter and pelvic floor muscles. Focus on improving coordination and endurance.
  - Home-based K exercises: 3 sets of 1015 contractions daily, holding each 5-10 seconds.
- **Bowel Habit Training:**
  - Implement scheduled toileting (e.g., every 2-3 hours during the day) to regulate bowel movements and reduce urgency.
  - Use a food and diary to identify triggers and optimize consistency.
- **Diet Management:**
  - Consult aitian to design a low-residue, high-fiber (soluble) diet to improve stool consistency. Avoid irritants (icy foods, caffeine, alcohol).
  - Small, frequent meals (56/day) to reduce gastrointestinal burden.
  - Ensure adequate hydration (1.5-2L/day, non-irritating fluids).
- **Pharmacological Support:**
  - Loperamide 2-4 mg up to twice daily, titrated to reduce stool frequency and improve continence, under gastroenterologist supervision.
  - Consider bulk-forming agents (e., psyllium) to stool consistency.

#### Management
- **Pharmacological Pain Relief:**
  - Topical lidocaine gel (2%) applied perianally post-defecation for immediate pain relief.
  - Consult pain specialist for possible low-dose amitriptyline (10-25 mg at night) to address neuropathic perianal pain and improve sleep.
- **Physical Therapy:**
  - Transcutaneous electrical nerve (TENS) applied to perianal region, 20 minutes, 3 times/week to reduce perception.
  - Gentle peral massage by trained therapist to reduce muscle tension and improve local circulation.
- **Behavioral Techniques:**
  - Teach relaxation techniques (e.g., diaphragmatic breathing) to reduce pain-related anxiety during defecation.

#### Sleep Disorder Management
- **Sleep Hygiene Education
  - Establish a consistent sleep, avoiding daytime naps longer than 30 minutes.
  - Limit fluid 2 hours before bedtime to reduce nocturnal incontinence episodes.
  - a relaxing bedroom environment (e.g., dim lighting, noise reduction).
- **Cognitive Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I):**
  - Weekly sessions with a psychologist to address sleep initiation difficulties and daytime dysfunction, focusing on stimulus control and sleep restriction techniques.
- **Pharmacological Support:**
  - Consider short-term use of low zolpidem (5 mg) or melatonin (3 mg) at bedtime, prescribed by a physician, to improve sleep onset.

#### Nutritional
- **Nutritional Counseling:**
  - Weekly dietitian consultations to address hypoproteinemia and anorexia.
  - High-protein, high-calorie supplements (e.g., nutritional supplements, 200-300 kcal/serving, 1-2/day) to address weight loss and muscle wasting.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Weekly weight and albumin level checks to assess nutritional progress.
  - Adjust dietary plan based on NRS-2002 reassessments every 2 weeks.

#### Psychological Support
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CB):**
  - Weekly sessions with a clinical psychologist to address moderate anxiety and depression, focusing on coping strategies for chronic illness and loss of social engagement.
- **Support Groups:**
  - En in a colorectal cancer survivor support group (virtual or in-person, feasible) to reduce social isolation and improve emotional resilience.
- **Mindfulness-Based Stress ReductionMBSR):**
 Daily 10-15 minute guided mindfulness sessions (via audio or therapist-led) to anxiety and improve emotional regulation.

#### Physical Rehabilitation
- **General Conditioning:**
  - Supervised low aerobic exercise (e.g., walking or stationary cycling), 20- minutes/day, 5 days/week, tailored to patient’s energy levels combat fatigue.
  - Progressive resistance training (light weights orweight exercises, 2-3 times/week) to improve muscle strength and.
- **Functional Training
  - Occupational therapy to improve activities of daily living (ADL), focusing on strategies to manage incontinence during social activities (e.g., use of absorbent products, planning outings around toileting schedules).

#### Monitoring and Follow-Up
- **Regular Assessments:**
  - Biweekly reassessment of LARS score, anal function (Xu Zhongfa’s scale), VAS pain score, PSQI, SAS, SDS, and NRS-2002 to track progress.
  - Monthly multidisciplinary team meetings (rehabilitation physician, gastroenterologist, dietitian, psychologist, physiotherapist) to adjust the plan as needed.
- **Patient Education:**
  - Provide written materials and counseling on managing LARS, incontinence, and chemotherapy side effects.
  - Train caregivers on supporting bowel and hygiene routines to reduce patient burden.

#### Coordination with Oncology Care
- Coordinate with the oncology team to monitor chemotherapy-related side effects (e.g., myelosuppression, gastrointestinal dysfunction) and adjust rehabilitation intensity accordingly.
- Ensure rehabilitation plan does not interfere with ongoing oncological treatments for liver metastasis.
