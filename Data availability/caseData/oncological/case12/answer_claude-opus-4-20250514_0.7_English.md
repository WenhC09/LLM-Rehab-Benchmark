# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
1. Improve pulmonary function and reduce dyspnea, aiming for a Borg dyspnea score of 2 or lower within 4 weeks.
2. Increase physical activity tolerance, targeting a peak metabolic equivalent (MET) of at least 6.0 within 6 weeks.
3. Address nutritional deficiencies to improve muscle mass, aiming for a PG-SGA score of 3 or lower within 8 weeks.
4. Enhance psychological well-being, reducing SAS and SDS scores by at least 10 points within 6 weeks.

### Long-term goals:
1. Achieve optimal pulmonary function with FVC improvement to at least 80% of predicted values within 3 months.
2. Maintain a stable weight and improve muscle mass, achieving a PG-SGA score of 1 (well-nourished) within 3 months.
3. Foster psychological resilience, aiming for SAS and SDS scores below 30 points within 3 months.
4. Promote a smoking cessation plan to reduce smoking habits significantly within 3 months.

## Treatment Methods:
1. **Pulmonary Rehabilitation**:
   - Implement a structured exercise program focusing on aerobic conditioning and strength training, tailored to the patient's current exercise capacity.
   - Utilize breathing exercises, including diaphragmatic and pursed-lip breathing techniques, to enhance respiratory muscle function and reduce dyspnea.
   - Monitor and adjust exercise intensity based on dyspnea and fatigue scores.

2. **Nutritional Support**:
   - Collaborate with a dietitian to develop a high-protein, calorie-dense meal plan to address malnutrition and promote muscle mass recovery.
   - Consider nutritional supplements if necessary to meet caloric and protein needs.

3. **Psychological Support**:
   - Provide access to counseling or support groups to address anxiety and depression, focusing on coping strategies and emotional support.
   - Introduce relaxation techniques such as mindfulness or guided imagery to help manage anxiety and improve overall mental health.

4. **Smoking Cessation Program**:
   - Initiate a smoking cessation program that includes counseling, behavioral therapy, and pharmacotherapy options (e.g., nicotine replacement therapy) to support quitting.

5. **Regular Monitoring and Follow-up**:
   - Schedule regular follow-up appointments to assess progress towards rehabilitation goals, adjusting the treatment plan as necessary based on patient feedback and clinical assessments.
   - Re-evaluate cardiopulmonary function and nutritional status at 6-week intervals to track improvements and make necessary adjustments to the rehabilitation plan.
