# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2–4 weeks)
- Improve ventilation function and relieve dyspnea (Borg ≤2 during daily activities).
- Increase diaphragmatic mobility and thoracic expansion.
- Enhance exercise tolerance (VO₂max and METmax improvement by ≥10% on re-test).
- Reduce fatigue perception (RPE ≤12 in daily activities).
- Initiate smoking cessation intervention.
- Stabilize nutritional status and prevent further muscle mass loss.
- Alleviate anxiety and depressive symptoms, improve sleep and mood.

### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
- Achieve optimal cardiopulmonary function for daily living and light-to-moderate exercise.
- Maintain independence in activities of daily living (ADL) without dyspnea at moderate exertion.
- Maintain or increase lean muscle mass and body weight within healthy range.
- Achieve sustained smoking cessation.
- Maintain psychological well-being with minimal anxiety/depression symptoms.
- Reduce risk of lung cancer recurrence through healthy lifestyle and improved cardiopulmonary reserve.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 Respiratory Function Training
- **Breathing exercises**:  
  - **Diaphragmatic breathing**: Supine, semi-recumbent, and sitting positions, 10–15 min, 3–4 times/day, focusing on abdominal expansion during inspiration.  
  - **Pursed-lip breathing**: During exertion and episodes of dyspnea to prolong expiration and prevent dynamic hyperinflation.  
- **Thoracic mobility training**: Gentle thoracic stretching, upper limb elevation with deep inspiration to improve chest wall compliance.  
- **Inspiratory muscle training (IMT)**: Start at 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure, 2 sessions/day, 15–20 min/session, adjust according to tolerance.

### 2.2 Aerobic Exercise Training
- **Mode**: Walking on flat ground or treadmill, stationary cycling.  
- **Intensity**: Moderate (40–60% VO₂max or Borg dyspnea scale 3–4).  
- **Duration**: Start with 15–20 min/session, gradually increase to 30–40 min.  
- **Frequency**: 3–5 sessions/week.  
- **Progression**: Increase time before intensity; monitor SpO₂ (maintain ≥90%), heart rate, and symptoms.

### 2.3 Strength and Endurance Training
- **Focus**: Major muscle groups, especially lower limbs and postural muscles to address muscle loss and improve functional capacity.  
- **Method**: Resistance bands or light weights, 2–3 sets of 8–12 repetitions, 2–3 times/week.  
- **Progression**: Gradual load increase as tolerated; avoid Valsalva maneuver.

### 2.4 Airway Clearance Techniques
- Educate on effective coughing, huffing techniques.  
- Use postural drainage positions if sputum volume increases.  
- Adequate hydration to reduce sputum viscosity.

### 2.5 Nutritional Support
- **Energy intake**: Adjust to meet increased metabolic demands; target protein 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day.  
- **Diet composition**: High-quality protein (fish, lean meat, dairy, soy), fresh vegetables, fruits; limit greasy and overly spicy food (considering TCM damp-heat pattern).  
- **Meal frequency**: Small, frequent meals to reduce postprandial dyspnea.  
- **Monitor**: Weight, muscle circumference; adjust diet accordingly.  
- **Referral**: Dietitian consultation for individualized plan.

### 2.6 Psychological Support
- **Education**: Disease knowledge, rehabilitation importance, coping strategies.  
- **Relaxation techniques**: Progressive muscle relaxation, breathing-focused mindfulness.  
- **Counseling**: Referral to psychologist if anxiety/depression persists.  
- **Peer support**: Encourage participation in lung cancer survivor or pulmonary rehab groups.

### 2.7 Smoking Cessation
- Provide counseling and educational materials on benefits of cessation.  
- Nicotine replacement therapy or pharmacologic support if indicated.  
- Regular follow-up to reinforce abstinence.

### 2.8 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Adjuncts
- Considering TCM diagnosis of damp-heat accumulation:  
  - Gentle herbal interventions under supervision of TCM physician.  
  - Acupressure or acupuncture to support lung function and reduce symptoms.  
  - Avoid overly hot or greasy foods.

### 2.9 Education and Self-Management
- Teach self-monitoring of symptoms, early recognition of exacerbations.  
- Instruct on safe exercise limits and warning signs to stop activity.  
- Emphasize adherence to rehabilitation schedule and medical follow-up.

**Note:** All exercise sessions should be supervised initially, with gradual transition to independent practice as safety and technique are ensured. Vital signs and oxygen saturation should be monitored during training, especially given the patient’s reduced breathing reserve.
