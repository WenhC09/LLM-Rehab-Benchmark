# **1. Rehabilitation Goals**

## **Short-term Goals:**
*   Restore the patient's physical status, enhance aerobic exercise capacity and ventilatory efficiency through rehabilitation training, and maximally improve quality of life.
*   Provide respiratory rehabilitation education to the patient, delivering comprehensive disease information and preparation for subsequent rehabilitation phases.

## **Long-term Goals:**
*   Assist the patient in establishing and maintaining scientific, healthy lifestyle, exercise, and dietary habits. The ultimate objective is to improve the patient's Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and social participation abilities.

### **2. Treatment Methods**
This case adopts a comprehensive "Five-in-One" rehabilitation model, detailed as follows:

*   **Medication Prescription:**
    1.  **Western Nebulization Therapy:** Nebulized inhalation of Salbutamol, Ipratropium Bromide combined with Chymotrypsin, twice daily, to dilate bronchi and reduce airway secretions.
    2.  **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Oral Therapy:** Based on signs including a red tongue with white greasy coating and slippery-rapid pulse, TCM syndrome differentiation indicates "Lung Cancer, Pattern of Dampness-Heat Accumulation". Treatment focuses on clearing heat and draining dampness, using modified Sanren Decoction. Formula: Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix (Danshen) 30g, Amomi Fructus Rotundus (Baidoukou) 6g, Armeniacae Semen Amarum (Kuxingren) 9g, Lophatheri Herba (Danzhuye) 9g, Luffae Fructus Retinervus (Sigualuo) 12g, Polyporus (Zhuling) 15g, Talcum (Huashi) 30g, Coicis Semen (Yiyiren) 30g, Artemisiae Scopariae Herba (Yinchen) 30g, Mori Ramus (stir-fried) (Chao Sangzhi) 15g, Aurantii Fructus Immaturus (stir-fried) (Chao Zhishi) 6g, Tetrapanacis Medulla (Tongcao) 9g, Lysimachiae Herba (Jinqiancao) 30g, Poria (Baifuling) 30g, Polygoni Cuspidati Rhizoma Et Radix (Huzhang) 30g, Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma (Tufuling) 30g, Maydis Stigma (Yumixu) 30g. One dose daily, decocted in water for oral administration. This formula aims to clear and diffuse lung qi, expel dampness, and dredge collaterals to alleviate symptoms like cough and expectoration.

*   **Exercise Prescription:**
    1.  **Breathing Training:**
        *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing:** Correct thoracoabdominal compensatory breathing pattern. Frequency: Daily, 2-3 sets/day, 8-10 breaths/set, 5 days/week.
        *   **Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT):** Using a threshold loading inspiratory muscle trainer. Intensity: â‰¥30% of Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP), or patient-perceived exertion reaching Borg Scale 4-5. Frequency: 30 breaths/session, lasting 10-20 minutes, 5 days/week.
        *   **Airway Clearance Techniques:** Once daily to assist in effective clearance of airway secretions.
    2.  **Aerobic & Resistance Training:**
        *   **Aerobic Training:** Using a lower limb cycle ergometer. Protocol: 5-minute warm-up at 20W power, cadence 40-50 rpm; followed by 25-minute main exercise at 30W power, cadence 40-50 rpm. Target heart rate: 100-115 bpm; Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE): 13-15. Duration: 25-30 minutes/session, frequency 5-7 sessions/week.
        *   **Resistance Training:** Elastic band resistance exercises for major muscle groups, 3 sessions/week.

*   **Nutrition Prescription:**
    Address moderate/suspected malnutrition and loss of major muscle group strength. Adjust dietary structure: Control sugar and fat intake; increase high-quality protein supplementation (e.g., egg whites, lean beef).

*   **Psychological Prescription:**
    Monitor sleep quality and daily mood fluctuations. Implement music therapy (playing soothing music) during aerobic exercise sessions to alleviate anxiety and depressive symptoms.

*   **Smoking Cessation Prescription:**
    Provide detailed smoking cessation education emphasizing the hazards of smoking on the disease condition. Require and supervise strict abstinence from smoking.
