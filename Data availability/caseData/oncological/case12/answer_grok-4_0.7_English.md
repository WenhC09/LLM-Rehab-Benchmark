# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks):
- Improve pulmonary ventilatory function, aiming to increase Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) to 75–80% of predicted value and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second/FVC (FEV₁/FVC) to 65%.
- Reduce dyspnea symptoms, targeting a Borg Scale score of ≤2 during light activity.
- Enhance exercise tolerance, increasing Peak Metabolic Equivalent (METmax) to 6.0.
- Improve nutritional status, reducing Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) score to ≤3 (Grade A).
- Address psychological distress, reducing Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores to <40.
- Promote smoking cessation to reduce airway irritation and improve lung function.

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
- Achieve sustained improvement in cardiopulmonary function, with Maximum Voluntary Ventilation (MVV) reaching 60% of predicted value and Peak Oxygen Uptake (VO₂max) ≥20 mL/(min·kg).
- Restore thoracic mobility and normalize breathing patterns to reduce compensatory thoracoabdominal breathing.
- Maintain stable nutritional status with adequate muscle strength and body weight.
- Achieve psychological stability, maintaining SAS and SDS scores within normal ranges (<35).
- Support complete smoking cessation and maintain recurrence-free status of lung cancer.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Pulmonary Rehabilitation
- **Aerobic Exercise**: Initiate supervised low-intensity aerobic training (e.g., treadmill walking or stationary cycling) at 50–60% of METmax (2.5–3 METs), 20–30 minutes per session, 3–5 times per week. Gradually increase intensity to 60–70% METmax as tolerated, monitoring Borg Scale (target ≤3) and heart rate (target 60–70% of maximum, ~100–110 bpm).
- **Breathing Exercises**: Implement diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing exercises, 10–15 minutes twice daily, to enhance diaphragmatic displacement (target ≥1.2 cm during quiet breathing) and reduce dyspnea.
- **Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT)**: Use a threshold inspiratory muscle trainer at 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure, 15 minutes daily, to improve MVV and breathing reserve.
- **Thoracic Mobility Exercises**: Perform chest expansion and upper limb stretching exercises, 10–15 repetitions, twice daily, to improve thoracic mobility and reduce compensatory breathing patterns.

### Nutritional Support
- **Dietary Counseling**: Collaborate with a dietitian to develop a high-protein, high-calorie diet (1.2–1.5 g/kg protein, 30–35 kcal/kg daily) to address moderate malnutrition (PG-SGA Grade B). Include small, frequent meals to manage anorexia and bitter taste symptoms.
- **Supplementation**: Prescribe oral nutritional supplements (e.g., high-protein shakes) to support muscle strength recovery, targeting a 5–10% increase in muscle mass over 3 months.
- **Hydration**: Ensure adequate fluid intake (1.5–2 L/day, adjusted for dark urine) to reduce dampness-heat per Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnosis.

### Psychological Support
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Refer to a psychologist for weekly CBT sessions to address mild anxiety and depression (SAS/SDS scores of 42), focusing on coping strategies for chronic illness and smoking cessation.
- **Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)**: Introduce guided mindfulness sessions, 10–15 minutes daily, to reduce psychological distress and improve mental status.

### Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Interventions
- **Acupuncture**: Administer acupuncture twice weekly targeting lung and spleen meridians (e.g., Feishu BL13, Taiyuan LU9, Zusanli ST36) to clear dampness-heat, improve appetite, and reduce cough and fatigue.
- **Herbal Medicine**: Prescribe TCM herbal formula (e.g., Qingzao Jiufei Decoction modified with herbs like Huang Qin and Zhi Mu) to address dampness-heat and support lung function, taken daily under TCM practitioner supervision.

### Smoking Cessation Program
- **Counseling**: Enroll in a structured smoking cessation program with weekly counseling sessions to address the patient’s 40-year smoking history, incorporating nicotine replacement therapy (e.g., nicotine patch) as needed.
- **Motivational Interviewing**: Conduct biweekly sessions to reinforce cessation goals and address barriers, aiming for complete cessation within 3 months.

### Monitoring and Follow-Up
- **Weekly Assessments**: Monitor Borg Scale, RPE, and vital signs during exercise sessions to adjust intensity and ensure safety.
- **Monthly Evaluations**: Repeat CPET and diaphragmatic ultrasound to track improvements in FVC, FEV₁/FVC, MVV, and diaphragmatic displacement.
- **Nutritional Follow-Up**: Reassess PG-SGA score every 4 weeks to ensure progress toward Grade A.
- **Psychological Follow-Up**: Readminister SAS and SDS every 6 weeks to evaluate psychological improvement.
- **Oncology Follow-Up**: Coordinate with oncologist for regular imaging (e.g., chest CT every 3–6 months) to monitor for cancer recurrence.

### Patient Education
- Educate on the importance of smoking cessation, proper breathing techniques, and adherence to nutritional and exercise plans.
- Provide resources for managing fatigue and stress, including written guides on diaphragmatic breathing and mindfulness exercises.
- Discuss TCM principles to enhance understanding of herbal and acupuncture interventions for dampness-heat.
