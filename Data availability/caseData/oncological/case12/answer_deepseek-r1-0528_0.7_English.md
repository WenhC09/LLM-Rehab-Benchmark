# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (2-4 weeks):
- Reduce Borg dyspnea score from 3 to ≤2 during ADLs
- Improve diaphragmatic excursion during deep inspiration by ≥0.5cm
- Increase nutritional intake to halt muscle mass loss (PG-SGA score reduction by 2 points)
- Achieve independent diaphragmatic breathing pattern during rest
- Reduce RPE fatigue score from 14 to ≤12 during light activities

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Improve VO₂max to ≥22 mL/(min·kg) (current 18.0)
- Increase FVC% predicted to ≥80% (current 72.6%)
- Achieve 30-min continuous ambulation at 3.0 METs without desaturation
- Normalize nutritional status (PG-SGA Grade A)
- Independent management of ADLs at 4 METs energy expenditure

## 2. Treatment Methods
### Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation
- **Interval Training Protocol**:  
  - Cycle ergometry: 3×/week  
  - Intensity: 40-60% peak workload (target HR 96-110 bpm)  
  - Interval ratio: 1:2 work-rest (e.g., 2-min exercise/4-min rest)  
  - Duration: Progress from 20→40 min/session  
- **Ventilatory Muscle Training**:  
  - Threshold loading: Start at 30% MIP, 2×15 reps bid  
  - Inspiratory muscle stretching: Supine diaphragmatic release techniques  
- **Breathing Retraining**:  
  - Pursed-lip breathing during exertion  
  - Postural drainage positioning (head-down tilt contraindicated post-cholecystectomy)  

### Nutritional Intervention
- **High-Protein Supplementation**:  
  - 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day protein intake (emphasis on leucine-rich sources)  
  - Omega-3 supplementation (2g/day) for anti-catabolic effect  
- **Appetite Management**:  
  - Bitter herbs decoction (per TCM diagnosis) pre-meals  
  - Small frequent meals (6×/day) with energy-dense foods  

### Physical Reconditioning
- **Peripheral Muscle Training**:  
  - Non-loadbearing exercises: Seated leg press (30% 1RM), 2×15 reps  
  - Resistance band training for upper limbs (yellow band intensity)  
- **Thoracic Mobility Exercises**:  
  - Costovertebral joint mobilizations (Grade I-II)  
  - Rib springing techniques in side-lying  

### Integrative Therapy
- **Traditional Chinese Medicine**:  
  - Acupuncture: LU9 (Taiyuan), BL13 (Feishu), ST36 (Zusanli) for damp-heat regulation  
  - Herbal fumigation: Asteris-Cordate formula for airway clearance  
- **Psychoeducation**:  
  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MDSR) for anxiety/depression scores  
  - Smoking cessation protocol with nicotine replacement therapy  

### Monitoring Parameters
- Continuous SpO₂ monitoring during exercise (terminate if <90%)
- Weekly diaphragmatic ultrasound measurements
- Biweekly 6MWT with modified Borg scale
- Nutritional reassessment q2 weeks
