# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (4-6 weeks)
*   **Reduce Dyspnea and Fatigue:** Decrease the Borg dyspnea score from 3 to 2 during activities of daily living (ADLs) and lower the baseline Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) from 14 to 11-12.
*   **Improve Breathing Pattern:** Establish a correct diaphragmatic breathing pattern during rest and light activity, reducing reliance on compensatory thoracoabdominal breathing. Increase diaphragmatic displacement during deep inspiration.
*   **Enhance Exercise Tolerance:** Increase continuous exercise duration at an intensity of 3.5 METs from the current baseline to 15-20 minutes.
*   **Initiate Strength Gains:** Halt further muscle loss and begin to improve strength in major muscle groups, enabling the patient to complete 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions with light resistance.
*   **Improve Nutritional Status:** Improve the PG-SGA score from B to A by increasing nutritional intake, particularly protein, to support muscle synthesis.
*   **Behavioral Modification:** Initiate a structured smoking cessation program.
*   **Psychological Adjustment:** Reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression (lower SAS/SDS scores) by providing coping strategies for dyspnea and fatigue.

### Long-term goals (3-6 months)
*   **Maximize Cardiopulmonary Function:** Increase Peak VO₂max to >20.0 mL/(min·kg) and Anaerobic Threshold (AT) to >4.0 METs, aiming to improve Weber classification from B to A. Improve Breathing Reserve (BR) to >15%.
*   **Functional Independence:** Achieve the ability to perform moderate-intensity household chores and community ambulation without significant dyspnea.
*   **Restore Muscle Mass and Strength:** Achieve measurable gains in limb muscle mass and functional strength (e.g., improved sit-to-stand test performance).
*   **Sustain Healthy Lifestyle:** Achieve and maintain complete smoking cessation. Independently manage a home exercise program and maintain a balanced, high-protein diet.
*   **Improve Quality of Life:** Enhance participation in social and recreational activities, improving overall well-being and reducing the psychological burden of the disease.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Pulmonary Rehabilitation & Exercise Therapy

**1. Aerobic Exercise Prescription (Based on CPET data):**
*   **Rationale:** The patient's exercise capacity is limited by ventilation (BR=0%), not cardiac function. The goal is to improve efficiency and reduce ventilatory demand at submaximal workloads.
*   **Intensity:** Start at an intensity just below the Anaerobic Threshold (AT), corresponding to **3.0-3.5 METs**. This translates to a target heart rate range determined during CPET at that MET level, and a subjective RPE of 11-13 ("Fairly light" to "Somewhat hard").
*   **Modality:** Stationary cycle or treadmill walking.
*   **Duration & Frequency:** Begin with interval training due to severe deconditioning: 2-3 minutes of exercise followed by 1-2 minutes of active recovery. Total exercise time 15-20 minutes per session, progressing to 30-40 minutes of continuous exercise as tolerated. To be performed **3-5 days per week**.
*   **Monitoring:** Continuous SpO₂ and heart rate monitoring during sessions. Session to be paused if SpO₂ drops below 88%.

**2. Resistance Training:**
*   **Rationale:** To combat sarcopenia identified by the PG-SGA and significant muscle loss, and to improve overall strength and functional capacity.
*   **Exercises:** Target major muscle groups: leg press, chest press, seated row, shoulder press, and core stability exercises.
*   **Intensity & Volume:** Start with low resistance (e.g., 50-60% of 1-Repetition Maximum) for **2 sets of 10-15 repetitions**. Focus on proper form and controlled breathing (exhale on exertion).
*   **Frequency:** **2-3 days per week** on non-consecutive days.

**3. Respiratory Muscle Training (RMT):**
*   **Rationale:** To directly address the primary ventilatory limitation (BR=0%) and documented diaphragmatic weakness.
*   **Method:** Use a threshold-based inspiratory muscle trainer (IMT).
*   **Prescription:** Start at an intensity of 30% of the patient's Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP). Perform **30 breaths, twice daily, 7 days a week**. Intensity should be progressively increased as strength improves.

**4. Breathing Retraining and Secretion Clearance:**
*   **Diaphragmatic Breathing:** One-on-one instruction to re-establish the diaphragm as the primary muscle of inspiration, using tactile feedback (hand on abdomen). Practice in supine, then sitting, then standing, and finally during walking.
*   **Pursed-Lip Breathing:** Teach as a technique to manage episodes of dyspnea, slow respiratory rate, and improve gas exchange.
*   **Thoracic Mobility Exercises:** Gentle trunk rotation, side bending, and shoulder girdle stretches to improve chest wall compliance, which is currently reduced.
*   **Airway Clearance Techniques:** Instruct on the Active Cycle of Breathing Technique (ACBT) to aid in expectoration and manage the productive cough.

### B. Nutritional Intervention

*   **Rationale:** To address moderate malnutrition (PG-SGA Grade B) and sarcopenia, which are critical barriers to physical recovery.
*   **Plan:**
    *   Referral to a registered dietitian for a comprehensive nutritional plan.
    *   **Goal:** High-protein, high-calorie diet. Target protein intake of **1.2-1.5 grams per kilogram of body weight per day**.
    *   **Strategy:** Recommend smaller, more frequent meals to combat poor appetite. Incorporate oral nutritional supplements, particularly those enriched with protein and leucine, between meals.
    *   Address taste changes (bitter taste) with dietary modifications (e.g., flavor enhancers, alternative food choices).

### C. Patient Education and Psychological Support

*   **Smoking Cessation:** This is a top priority.
    *   Provide direct, unambiguous medical advice on the critical importance of quitting.
    *   Offer counseling and connect the patient with smoking cessation programs.
    *   Discuss pharmacotherapy options (e.g., Nicotine Replacement Therapy, Varenicline) with the primary medical team.
*   **Energy Conservation & Symptom Management:**
    *   Educate on pacing activities, planning the day, and modifying tasks to conserve energy.
    *   Reinforce the use of pursed-lip breathing and specific body positions (e.g., forward lean) to manage acute dyspnea.
*   **Psychological Counseling:**
    *   Acknowledge the patient's mild anxiety and depression (SAS/SDS scores).
    *   Incorporate relaxation techniques (e.g., guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation) into the rehabilitation sessions.
    *   Provide education on the link between dyspnea and anxiety to break the panic-dyspnea cycle.
    *   Recommend a formal consultation with a psychologist or mental health professional if symptoms persist or worsen.
