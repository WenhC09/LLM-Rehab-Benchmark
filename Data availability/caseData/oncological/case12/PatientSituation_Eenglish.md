# Case Information

## Case Summary

A 68-year-old male patient was admitted due to "recurrent cough and dyspnea for over 1 year, aggravated for 1 week."  

In October 2019, a physical examination revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules accompanied by irritating cough, with progressively worsening symptoms. In September 2020, due to nodule enlargement, he underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for resection of the right lower lung dorsal segment and right upper lung bulla under general anesthesia. Postoperative pathology indicated (right lower lung nodule) peripherally located invasive adenocarcinoma, pT₁aN₀M₀, Stage I A1, with air-space spread. The patient received 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with the AP regimen. Subsequent regular outpatient follow-ups showed no significant recurrence or metastasis. At admission, the patient complained of cough, expectoration, dyspnea, fatigue, occasional dizziness, bitter taste in the mouth, palpitations, anorexia, and dark urine.  

-   **Past Medical History**: History of duodenal bulbar ulcer surgery and cholecystectomy.  
-   **Personal History**: Smoking history of >40 years, 20 cigarettes/day, not quit. No alcohol consumption.  
-   **Physical Examination**: Alert, fair mental status. A 2cm surgical scar visible in the right costal region with good healing. Diminished breath sounds in the right lung on auscultation, no significant dry or moist rales. Reduced thoracic mobility with compensatory thoracoabdominal breathing pattern. Heart rate 96 bpm, regular rhythm. Tongue: red body with white greasy coating; pulse: slippery and rapid.  
-   **Diagnosis**:  
    1.  **Western Medicine Diagnosis**: Postoperative status of right lower lobe malignancy - Primary peripherally located invasive adenocarcinoma pT₁aN₀M₀ Stage I A1 with air-space spread, PS 1.  
    2.  **Functional Diagnosis**: Pulmonary ventilatory dysfunction.  
    3.  **Traditional Chinese Medicine Diagnosis**: Lung cancer, pattern of internal accumulation of dampness-heat.
