# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (4-8 weeks):
- Achieve independent bed mobility (bridging, rolling) with minimal assistance
- Develop effective respiratory muscle training to reduce dyspnea episodes
- Reduce neuropathic pain from VAS 3-4 to ≤2
- Establish structured bowel program for constipation management
- Prevent lower limb contractures through daily ROM exercises
- Maintain skin integrity with zero pressure injuries
- Achieve assisted feeding using adaptive equipment

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Attain independent power wheelchair mobility with chin/head control
- Achieve modified independence in ADLs with adaptive equipment
- Establish effective bladder management program
- Develop independent sitting balance (level 2)
- Reduce lower limb spasticity to Ashworth I
- Maximize residual upper limb function for environmental control
- Implement pain self-management strategies

## 2. Treatment Methods
### Physical Therapy
- **Respiratory Training**: Diaphragmatic breathing exercises, incentive spirometry, and assisted cough techniques
- **Positioning Program**: 2-hour turning schedule with pressure-relieving mattress
- **Spasticity Management**: Gentle PROM exercises 2x/day, static splinting for wrist/hand
- **Mobility Training**: Progressive tilt-table standing (starting 15°), power wheelchair assessment for head control interface
- **Therapeutic Exercise**: Neuromuscular electrical stimulation for biceps activation

### Occupational Therapy
- **ADL Adaptation**: Customized feeding devices, environmental control system training
- **Upper Limb Management**: Tenodesis splinting, graded motor imagery for pain
- **Sensory Re-education**: Desensitization techniques for neuropathic pain
- **Energy Conservation**: Activity pacing strategies for self-care tasks

### Medical Management
- **Spasticity Control**: Oral baclofen titration starting 5mg TID
- **Neuropathic Pain Protocol**: Gabapentin starting 100mg TID with VAS monitoring
- **Bowel Program**: Scheduled digital stimulation + glycerin suppositories
- **Bladder Management**: Intermittent catheterization trial with urodynamics

### Specialized Interventions
- **Seating Clinic**: Custom molded wheelchair seating system with pressure mapping
- **Psychological Support**: Cognitive behavioral therapy for adjustment counseling
- **Nutrition Optimization**: High-fiber/high-protein diet with hydration protocol
- **Preventative Care**: Daily skin checks, vitamin D supplementation

### Family Training
- Safe transfer techniques (slide board, mechanical lift)
- Catheter management skills
- Home exercise program supervision
- Pressure ulcer prevention education
