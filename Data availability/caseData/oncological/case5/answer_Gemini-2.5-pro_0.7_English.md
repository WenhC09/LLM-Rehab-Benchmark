# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

Given the patient's diagnosis of a WHO Grade IV diffuse midline glioma and the resulting severe C2 ASIA B spinal cord injury, the overarching rehabilitation approach will be supportive and palliative. The goals will focus on preventing secondary complications, managing symptoms, maximizing patient comfort and quality of life, and empowering the patient and caregivers with the skills to manage his condition.

#### Short-term goals (within 4-6 weeks):
*   **Prevent Secondary Complications:**
    *   Maintain clear lungs and prevent pneumonia through an effective respiratory management program.
    *   Prevent pressure injuries by establishing a consistent and effective turning and positioning schedule.
    *   Maintain full passive range of motion in all joints to prevent contractures.
*   **Symptom Management:**
    *   Reduce neuropathic pain in the upper limbs from VAS 3-4 to VAS < 2.
    *   Manage lower limb spasticity to facilitate ease of care, positioning, and patient comfort.
*   **Functional Improvement & Caregiver Training:**
    *   Establish a regular, predictable bowel and bladder management program to prevent constipation and urinary tract infections.
    *   Achieve tolerance to sitting upright in a specialized wheelchair for at least 1-2 hours daily to improve respiratory function and psychological well-being.
    *   Train primary caregivers in safe and effective techniques for passive range of motion, positioning, skin inspection, and hoist transfers.
*   **Psychological and Nutritional Support:**
    *   Address lethargy and poor appetite through psychological and nutritional consultation.
    *   Establish a means of communication and environmental control for the patient.

#### Long-term goals:
*   **Maximize Independence and Quality of Life:**
    *   Independently operate an environmental control unit (ECU) and/or a specialized power wheelchair using appropriate switch access (e.g., head array, sip-and-puff).
    *   Establish a sustainable and safe home management plan, including all necessary durable medical equipment (hospital bed, hoist, specialized wheelchair, pressure-relieving mattress).
*   **Maintain Physical Integrity:**
    *   Remain free of contractures and pressure injuries.
    *   Maintain a stable respiratory status, minimizing episodes of infection.
*   **Empowerment and Participation:**
    *   Enable the patient to participate in social and leisure activities from his wheelchair.
    *   Ensure the patient and family feel confident and competent in managing daily care needs at home.

### 2. Treatment Methods

A multidisciplinary team approach is essential, involving physical therapy, occupational therapy, nursing, psychology, and nutrition.

#### Physical Therapy (PT)
*   **Respiratory Therapy:**
    *   **Manual Assisted Coughing:** To assist with secretion clearance.
    *   **Postural Drainage & Percussion:** Performed in various positions to mobilize secretions.
    *   **Breathing Exercises:** Focus on diaphragmatic breathing to maximize inspiratory capacity, if any diaphragmatic function is present.
*   **Range of Motion (ROM) and Stretching:**
    *   **Passive ROM:** Twice daily for all four limbs and neck to prevent joint stiffness and contractures.
    *   **Spasticity Management:** Prolonged, gentle stretching of lower limb extensors, adductors, and plantarflexors.
*   **Positioning:**
    *   **Bed Positioning:** Develop a strict 2-hour turning schedule. Utilize pillows and wedges to offload bony prominences (sacrum, trochanters, heels, occiput) and maintain neutral joint alignment.
    *   **Verticalization:** Initiate a tilt-table program, progressing duration and angle as tolerated, to manage orthostatic hypotension, improve bone density, and assist with spasticity and respiratory function.
*   **Strengthening:**
    *   **Active-Assisted/Active ROM:** For bilateral biceps (L: Grade 2, R: Grade 1) in a gravity-eliminated plane to maintain existing muscle function.

#### Occupational Therapy (OT)
*   **Upper Limb Management:**
    *   **Splinting:** Fabricate custom bilateral resting hand splints to be worn during periods of rest to prevent wrist/finger flexor contractures and maintain a functional hand position.
*   **Seating and Mobility:**
    *   **Wheelchair Prescription:** Comprehensive assessment for a high-level power wheelchair with power tilt, recline, and elevating leg rests. This is critical for independent pressure relief, managing spasticity, and improving positioning for breathing and feeding.
*   **Assistive Technology (AT) and Environmental Control:**
    *   **Access Assessment:** Evaluate for the most appropriate control interface (e.g., sip-and-puff, head array, chin control) based on patient's minimal voluntary movement and preference.
    *   **ECU Training:** Train the patient to use the selected interface to control lights, television, call bell, and potentially a computer or communication device. This is the primary avenue for restoring autonomy.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) & Caregiver Training:**
    *   Focus entirely on caregiver education. Provide hands-on training for safe transfers using a mechanical hoist, bed mobility (log rolling), dressing, and bathing techniques that protect both the patient and the caregiver.

#### Medical and Nursing Management
*   **Pain Management:**
    *   Continue collaboration with the primary medical team on pharmacological management for neuropathic pain (e.g., gabapentinoids, TCAs).
    *   Utilize non-pharmacological modalities such as proper positioning and Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) on the upper limbs.
*   **Spasticity Management:**
    *   In addition to PT stretching, coordinate with the medical team regarding the potential need for oral antispasmodics (e.g., baclofen, tizanidine) if spasticity interferes with care or causes pain.
*   **Bowel & Bladder Care:**
    *   **Bladder:** Maintain indwelling catheter with strict aseptic technique. Educate patient and family on signs of UTI (cloudy/foul-smelling urine, fever).
    *   **Bowel:** Implement a bowel program consisting of a high-fiber diet (as tolerated), adequate fluid intake, and a scheduled routine of suppositories followed by digital stimulation to ensure complete evacuation every 1-2 days.
*   **Skin Care:**
    *   Daily, thorough skin inspections by nursing staff and caregivers, with special attention to all bony prominences.
    *   Ensure use of a pressure-redistribution mattress on the bed and a pressure-relieving cushion in the wheelchair.

#### Psychosocial and Nutritional Support
*   **Psychological Support:**
    *   Referral to a clinical psychologist or rehabilitation psychologist for counseling to address adjustment to disability, coping with a life-limiting diagnosis, anxiety, and management of lethargy/depressive symptoms.
*   **Nutritional Support:**
    *   Consultation with a registered dietitian to address poor appetite, prevent malnutrition, and ensure adequate protein and calorie intake to support skin integrity and energy levels. Consider modified textures if there is any difficulty swallowing.

#### Patient and Family Education
*   Continuous education on all aspects of care.
*   Critical education on recognizing and responding to potential emergencies, including autonomic dysreflexia (AD), signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and respiratory distress.
*   Discharge planning to begin immediately, focusing on home modifications and acquisition of all necessary durable medical equipment.
