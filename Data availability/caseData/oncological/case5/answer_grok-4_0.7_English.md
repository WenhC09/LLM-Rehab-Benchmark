# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks):
- Improve upper limb muscle strength (biceps brachii) to MMT Grade III bilaterally to facilitate basic self-care tasks.
- Reduce neuropathic pain (VAS score) from 3–4 to 1–2 to improve comfort and participation in therapy.
- Enhance respiratory function through diaphragmatic breathing exercises to reduce dyspnea.
- Achieve assisted sitting balance (Grade I) to support upright positioning and prevent secondary complications.
- Manage spasticity in bilateral lower limbs (reduce Ashworth Grade II to I) to improve comfort and positioning.
- Establish a bowel management program to address constipation and promote regular defecation.
- Prevent secondary complications (e.g., pressure ulcers, contractures, deep vein thrombosis).

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
- Achieve partial independence in basic ADLs (e.g., feeding, grooming) with adaptive equipment and minimal assistance (ADL score ≥20).
- Maintain or improve upper limb strength to MMT Grade IV to support functional tasks like wheelchair propulsion.
- Restore dynamic sitting balance (Grade II) to enable safe transfers and wheelchair use.
- Optimize bladder and bowel management to achieve consistent, predictable patterns with minimal complications.
- Enhance respiratory endurance to support daily activities and reduce fatigue.
- Promote psychosocial adjustment to improve mental status and social participation.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy:
- **Passive Range of Motion (PROM)**: Perform PROM exercises for all major joints (shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles) 2–3 times daily to prevent contractures and maintain joint mobility.
- **Strength Training**: Focus on biceps brachii with assisted active exercises (e.g., gravity-eliminated movements) for 15–20 minutes daily, progressing to light resistance as tolerated (MMT Grade III target).
- **Spasticity Management**: Apply prolonged stretching to lower limbs (20–30 minutes per session, 2–3 times daily) to reduce Ashworth Grade II spasticity. Use positioning (e.g., prone lying, splinting) to maintain neutral joint alignment.
- **Respiratory Training**: Implement diaphragmatic breathing and incentive spirometry for 10–15 minutes, 3–4 times daily, to improve respiratory muscle strength and reduce dyspnea.
- **Postural Training**: Begin assisted sitting in a wheelchair with a high-back support for 30–60 minutes daily, gradually increasing duration to improve sitting balance and endurance.

### Occupational Therapy:
- **Upper Limb Functional Training**: Introduce task-specific exercises (e.g., reaching, grasping) with adaptive aids (e.g., universal cuff) for 30 minutes daily to promote partial independence in feeding and grooming.
- **ADL Retraining**: Use compensatory techniques and adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled utensils, button hooks) to facilitate self-care tasks, aiming for minimal assistance within 8 weeks.
- **Environmental Modifications**: Recommend wheelchair-accessible home modifications (e.g., ramps, widened doorways) to support future discharge planning.

### Pain Management:
- **Pharmacological**: Continue neuropathic pain management with medications (e.g., gabapentin or pregabalin) as prescribed, titrated to reduce VAS score to 1–2.
- **Non-pharmacological**: Apply trans electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to upper limbs for 20 minutes daily to reduce numbness and pain. Incorporate relaxation techniques (e.g guided imagery) to address pain.

### Bladder and Bowel Management:
- **Bladder Maintain indwelling catheter with regular monitoring for infections. Initiate bladder retraining with timed voiding (every 4– hours) as tolerated to prepare for potential intermittent catheterization.
- **Bowel**: Implement a bowel program with-fiber diet, adequate hydration (1.5–2 L/day), and toileting (daily or every other day) using digital stimulation or suppositories to address constipation.

### Therapy:
- **Chest Physiotherapy**: Perform percussion and postural drainage twice daily to prevent respiratory complications and enhance lung clearance.
- **Breathing Exercises**: Continue diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing to improve respiratory efficiency and reduce dyspnea.

### Psychosocial Support:
- **Counseling Provide weekly psychological counseling (30–45 minutes) to poor mental status, focusing on coping strategies and adjustment to disability.
- **Family Education**: Conduct biweekly family training sessions to teach caregiving techniques, equipment use, and support strategies to enhance home support.

### Assistive Devices and Orthotics:
- **Wheelchair Prescription**: Provide a customized power wheelchair with pressure-relieving cushion to support mobility and prevent pressure ulcers.
- **Orthotics**: Use resting hand splints and ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) to maintain neutral joint positioning and prevent contractures.

### Monitoring and Prevention:
- **Skin Integrity**: Perform daily skin inspections and repositioning every 2 hours to prevent pressure ulcers. Use pressure-relieving mattresses and cushions.
- **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prevention**: Apply sequential compression devices and monitor for signs of DVT. Encourage passive leg movements during therapy sessions.
- **Nutritional**: Consult a dietitian to ensure adequate caloric and protein intake to support healing and prevent muscle wasting. Address anorexia with small, frequent meals.

### Coordination:
- Coordinate with neurosurgery and oncology teams to monitor glioma progression and adjust rehabilitation based on medical status.
- Schedule weekly team meetings to review progress, adjust goals, and address complications.

This plan will be reassessed biweekly to adjust interventions based on the patient’s response and functional progress.
