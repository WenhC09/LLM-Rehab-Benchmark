# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4–6 weeks)
- **Positioning & Prevention**: Maintain proper posture to prevent pressure injuries, joint contractures, and respiratory complications.
- **Pain & Spasticity Control**: Reduce neuropathic pain (target VAS ≤2) and manage bilateral lower limb spasticity.
- **Respiratory Support**: Improve pulmonary ventilation and secretion clearance; prevent pneumonia.
- **Basic ADL Assistance**: Train caregiver-assisted bed mobility and transfers to reduce nursing burden.
- **Bladder/Bowel Management**: Establish individualized neurogenic bladder and bowel care routines to prevent infections and constipation.
- **Sensory & Motor Stimulation**: Begin sensory re-education and residual motor facilitation to preserve neural pathways.

### Long-term goals (3–6 months, depending on disease progression)
- **Maximize Functional Independence**: Achieve maximal possible independence in wheelchair mobility, pressure relief, and self-feeding (with adaptive devices if feasible).
- **Optimize Quality of Life**: Enhance participation in communication, recreation, and social interactions.
- **Prevent Secondary Complications**: Maintain skin integrity, joint range of motion, and cardiopulmonary health.
- **Psychological Adaptation**: Support emotional adjustment, coping, and motivation for ongoing rehabilitation.
- **Caregiver Competence**: Ensure caregivers are proficient in safe handling, transfer, and medical care techniques.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Physical Therapy (PT)
1. **Positioning & Passive Range of Motion (PROM)**
   - Daily PROM for all joints (2–3 times/day, 10–15 reps per joint) to prevent contractures.
   - Proper limb positioning with splints or cushions to prevent deformities.
2. **Spasticity Management**
   - Slow, prolonged stretching of lower limb extensor muscle groups.
   - Use of inhibitory techniques (e.g., weight-bearing in supported positions, cryotherapy if tolerated).
   - Consider physician-directed pharmacologic options (oral antispasmodics, local injections) if needed.
3. **Bed Mobility Training**
   - Gradual facilitation of rolling, supported sitting tolerance (tilt table training), and bed-to-chair transfer practice with maximal assistance.
4. **Respiratory Training**
   - Diaphragmatic breathing, assisted coughing techniques.
   - Incentive spirometer exercises, 10–15 breaths every 1–2 hours while awake.
5. **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**
   - Apply to residual functioning upper limb muscles (e.g., biceps) to help maintain muscle bulk and stimulate motor pathways.

### B. Occupational Therapy (OT)
1. **ADL Training**
   - Self-feeding training with adaptive utensils if upper limb function allows.
   - Grooming and hygiene activities with assistive devices.
2. **Upper Limb Function Facilitation**
   - Task-oriented therapy focusing on residual proximal upper limb strength (e.g., biceps).
   - Use of mobile arm supports for gravity compensation.
3. **Assistive Technology**
   - Early introduction of environmental control systems (voice-activated devices) to promote autonomy.
4. **Splinting**
   - Resting hand splints to prevent contractures and maintain functional position.

### C. Sensory Stimulation & Pain Management
1. **Sensory Re-education**
   - Light touch, pressure, vibration stimulation below sensory level for cortical input.
2. **Neuropathic Pain Management**
   - Physical modalities: TENS around painful areas (avoid tumor site if unstable).
   - Pharmacologic management per medical team (e.g., gabapentinoids).
   - Relaxation techniques and guided imagery.

### D. Bladder & Bowel Management
1. **Neurogenic Bladder**
   - Continue indwelling catheter initially; evaluate for intermittent catheterization program when feasible.
   - Monitor for urinary tract infection.
2. **Neurogenic Bowel**
   - Scheduled bowel program (timed defecation after meals).
   - Use of stool softeners, suppositories, and digital stimulation as indicated.
   - Adequate hydration and dietary fiber.

### E. Skin Integrity Maintenance
- Daily skin inspection by patient/caregiver.
- Pressure relief every 2 hours in bed, every 15–30 minutes when sitting.
- Use of pressure-relieving mattress and wheelchair cushion.

### F. Psychological & Social Support
- Early psychological counseling to address adjustment disorder and depression risk.
- Family education on prognosis, care techniques, and prevention of complications.
- Social work involvement for disability resources and community support.

### G. Medical Management Coordination
- Close collaboration with oncology and neurosurgery teams to monitor tumor status and systemic condition.
- Adjust rehabilitation intensity according to overall medical stability and oncologic treatment schedule.
