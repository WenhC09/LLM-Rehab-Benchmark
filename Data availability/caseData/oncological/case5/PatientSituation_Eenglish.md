# Case Summary

A 22-year-old male was admitted due to "discovery of intramedullary spinal cord mass for 1 year". One and a half years ago, he developed left hand and lower limb weakness without obvious cause, later progressing to quadriplegia with limb numbness, girdle-like sensation in chest and abdomen, and dyspnea. He underwent "Microscopic intramedullary and subdural tumor resection from C1 to T1". Pathology revealed "Diffuse midline glioma, H3K27M-mutant, WHO grade IV". Despite postoperative radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, while upper limb weakness partially improved, all limbs remain unable to lift off the bed, with complete dependence on others for activities of daily living (ADLs). Admission was for further rehabilitation.

# Pre-rehabilitation Case Information

### I. History of Present Illness

A 22-year-old male developed sudden left hand weakness without apparent cause 1.5 years ago, followed by left lower limb weakness and left cervicoshoulder pain. Local hospital MRI indicated "spinal cord lesion" of undetermined nature. Symptoms partially resolved after symptomatic treatment for "myelitis". One year ago, symptoms worsened with bilateral lower limb weakness and inability to ambulate. Nine months ago, bilateral upper limb weakness appeared, progressing to severe quadriplegia with limb numbness, occasional girdle-like sensation in chest/abdomen, and dyspnea. Five months ago, he presented to our neurosurgery department. Four months ago, he underwent "Microscopic intramedullary and subdural tumor resection from C1 to T1". Pathology confirmed "Diffuse midline glioma, H3K27M-mutant, WHO grade IV". Postoperatively, limb weakness worsened. Treatments included dehydration therapy for spinal cord edema reduction, neurotrophic agents, analgesics, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Upper limb weakness improved slightly, but all limbs remain unable to lift off the bed, with complete dependence for ADLs (feeding, dressing, transfers, toileting, bathing). Admitted for further management with diagnosis of "Spinal Cord Injury". No fever since onset. Currently alert with poor mental status, anorexia, normal sleep, indwelling urinary catheter, spontaneous defecation with constipation. No significant weight change.

### II. Past Medical History
Previously healthy.

### III. Physical Examination
*   **General Status**: Normal spinal alignment with physiological curvature. No limb deformity or swelling.
*   **Sensory Examination**: Lowest normal sensory level L/R: C3/C3.
*   **Pain Assessment**: Bilateral upper limb numbness and pain, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 3-4.
*   **Manual Muscle Testing (MMT)**:
    *   Biceps brachii: L/R; Grade II / Grade I
    *   Extensor carpi radialis longus/brevis: L/R: Grade 0 / Grade 0
    *   Triceps brachii: L/R: Grade 0 / Grade 0
    *   Flexor digitorum profundus (middle finger): L/R: Grade 0 / Grade 0
    *   Abductor digiti minimi: L/R: Grade 0 / Grade 0
    *   Iliopsoas: L/R: Grade 0 / Grade 0
    *   Quadriceps femoris: L/R: Grade 0 / Grade 0
    *   Tibialis anterior: L/R: Grade 0 / Grade 0

*   **Muscle Tone**: Bilateral lower limb extensor muscle tone Ashworth Grade II.
*   **Balance Function**: Sitting balance Grade 0, Standing balance Grade 0.
*   **Reflexes**: Abdominal reflexes (+), bilateral patellar and Achilles reflexes (+), saddle sensation and deep pressure sensation present, bulbocavernosus reflex (+), bilateral Babinski sign (+).
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL)**: ADL score 0.

### IV. Auxiliary Examinations
*   **Pathology**: (Spinal cord mass) Glial cell tumor. Diffusely arranged tumor cells with moderate atypia, frequent mitoses, and microvascular proliferation. Immunohistochemistry: GFAP (+), Vimentin (+), IDH1 (-), ATRX (+), H3K27M (+), H3K27Me3 (-), P16 (+), P53 (+), S100 (+), Olig-2 (+), NF (-), Syn (+), EMA (-), EGFR (+), Ki-67 (70%+). Conclusion: Diffuse midline glioma, H3K27M-mutant, WHO grade IV.
*   **Imaging**: Cervical spine contrast-enhanced MRI revealed an intramedullary space-occupying lesion.

### V. Diagnosis
1.  C2 Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation (AIS Grade B, neoplastic): Quadriplegia, Limb sensory dysfunction.
2.  Bilateral lower limb spasticity.
3.  Pathological neuropathic pain: Impaired ADLs, Restricted social participation.
4.  Postoperative status of diffuse midline glioma (C1-T1).

### VI. Primary Functional Impairments
Decreased limb sensation, Decreased limb muscle strength, Respiratory dysfunction, Bilateral lower limb spasticity, Neurogenic bladder, Neurogenic bowel, Impaired ADLs (Unable to turn in bed, sit up, stand/walk independently, transfer, or toilet).
