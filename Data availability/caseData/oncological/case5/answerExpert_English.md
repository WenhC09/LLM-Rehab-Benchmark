# **1. Rehabilitation Goals**

## **Short-Term Goals (Within 2 weeks):**
*   Establish and master diaphragmatic breathing pattern.
*   Achieve independent bed mobility (rolling and sitting up) with minimal assistance.
*   Improve sitting balance to Level I.

## **Long-Term Goals (Within 6 weeks):**
*   Achieve independence in wheelchair activities of daily living (ADLs).
*   Achieve partial independence in ADLs, reducing reliance on caregivers.

# **2. Therapeutic Interventions**

*   **Psychological Therapy:**
    *   Address introverted personality and poor treatment compliance: Physician and therapist jointly provide simplified explanation of condition and rehabilitation precautions. Familiarize patient with therapy environment to alleviate fear.
    *   With family support, encourage communication with medical staff and active participation in group rehabilitation education activities to foster a positive rehabilitation mindset.

*   **Neuropathic Pain Management:**
    *   Alleviate band-like sensation in chest and numbness/pain in bilateral upper limbs (VAS score 3-5) secondary to injury-level dysesthesia and neuropathy: Administer oral Gabapentin capsules 0.3g every 8 hours.

*   **Positioning and Complication Prevention:**
    *   Prevent pressure injuries and hypostatic pneumonia: Utilize air mattress. Nurse assists family to perform turning and back percussion every 2 hours, alternating between supine and bilateral side-lying positions.
    *   In supine: Place wedge cushions lateral to bilateral hip joints to prevent external rotation. Apply ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) bilaterally to prevent Achilles tendon shortening.

*   **Range of Motion (ROM) Maintenance & Muscle Stretching:**
    *   Therapist performs passive ROM (PROM) to all limb joints once daily. Utilize lower limb active-passive training system (MOTOmed-Letto2) for active-assisted ROM training: 15 minutes/session, twice daily.
    *   Educate family on performing gentle, slow PROM within physiological joint limits during other times to prevent soft tissue strain or heterotopic ossification. Perform bilateral lower limb muscle stretching twice daily (10 minutes/session).

*   **Residual Muscle Strength Training:**
    *   Apply neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to erector spinae, bilateral deltoids, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, wrist extensors, and bilateral tibialis anterior muscles. Parameters: Frequency 20Hz, Intensity 5mA; 10 minutes/session, once daily.
    *   Active muscle strengthening: Focus on bilateral elbow flexors/extensors, bilateral shoulder girdle muscles, and trapezius. 20 minutes/session, twice daily.

*   **Respiratory Training:**
    Perform respiratory training once daily (20 minutes/session), including:
    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing combined with Pursed-Lip Breathing:** Semi-Fowler's or sitting position. Inhale deeply through nose (abdomen protrudes), exhale slowly through pursed lips (abdomen retracts).
    *   **Progressive Resistance Inspiratory Muscle Training (PRIMT):** Use inspiratory muscle trainer. Train with rapid deep inspiration (2-3 seconds) followed by calm expiration (3-4 seconds), exerting maximal inspiratory effort.

*   **Endurance Training:**
    *   Primarily utilize tilt table for assisted standing. Initial angle: 35°, titrated based on tolerance (absence of dizziness, palpitations, chest tightness). Monitor blood pressure closely.
    *   Increase standing angle by 2° daily. 20 minutes/session, twice daily.

*   **Rolling and Sit-to-Edge Training:**
    *   **Rolling Training:** Initially assist with log-rolling. As shoulder girdle strength improves, progress to assisted rolling: Therapist/family flexes one lower limb and guides pelvic rotation.
    *   **Sit-to-Edge Training:** From supine, utilize wedge cushion to achieve semi-Fowler's position. Assist bilateral triceps activation to transfer from lying to sitting.

*   **Bladder Training:**
    *   With indwelling catheter: Implement scheduled catheter opening. Initial schedule: Open every 2 hours. Gradually extend interval to every 4 hours. Target urine output: 400-500mL per void.
    *   Educate patient to recognize bladder filling cues and consciously perform voiding maneuvers to train detrusor muscle contraction.
