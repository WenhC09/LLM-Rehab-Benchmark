# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2–4 weeks)
- Improve left upper limb muscle strength by at least 0.5–1 MMT grade.
- Increase left shoulder abduction to ≥120°, left hip flexion to ≥100°, and left wrist extension to ≥70° to facilitate functional activities.
- Enhance sitting balance to grade III and standing balance to grade II, with Berg Balance Scale score ≥42/56 to reduce fall risk.
- Achieve independent wheelchair propulsion and safe transfers with minimal assistance.
- Reduce urinary frequency episodes by ≥20% through bladder training strategies.
- Improve nocturnal sleep duration to ≥4 hours with fewer awakenings.
- Reduce HAMA score by ≥25% through psychological support and relaxation interventions.
- Maintain skin integrity and prevent secondary complications (falls, pressure ulcers, contractures, DVT).

### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
- Regain functional ambulation with minimal assistive device over ≥50 meters (FAC level ≥4).
- Improve left upper limb function to FTHUE level V, enabling gross grasp and partial pinch for basic self-care.
- Achieve Modified Barthel Index ≥70/100, indicating only mild ADL dependence.
- Maintain stable psychological status with minimal anxiety/depression symptoms.
- Establish effective bladder control with significant reduction in nocturia and daytime frequency.
- Achieve safe stair negotiation with supervision.
- Enable participation in light household activities and social/family engagement.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 Physical Therapy (PT)
- **Muscle Strengthening**:  
  - Active-assisted to active-resistive exercises for left upper and lower limbs, focusing on proximal-to-distal progression.
  - Use of elastic bands, therapy putty, and hand exercisers for graded resistance training.
- **Range of Motion (ROM) Maintenance and Enhancement**:  
  - Daily passive and active-assisted ROM for left shoulder, wrist, hip, and knee to prevent contracture.
- **Balance and Postural Control**:  
  - Static and dynamic sitting balance training on therapy mat, progressing to supported standing balance with parallel bars.
  - Weight-shifting and reaching tasks to improve proprioception.
- **Gait Training**:  
  - Initiate with parallel bars, progressing to quad cane or walker, emphasizing step symmetry and safety.
  - Incorporate endurance training with gradual distance increase, monitoring RPE ≤4.

### 2.2 Occupational Therapy (OT)
- **Upper Limb Functional Training**:  
  - Task-oriented activities such as reaching, grasp-release, and object manipulation.
  - Fine motor training for hand dexterity (pegboards, coin sorting).
- **ADL Retraining**:  
  - Dressing, grooming, feeding with adaptive techniques and assistive devices.
  - Practice bed-to-chair and toilet transfers with safety emphasis.
- **Home Environment Simulation**:  
  - Practice household activities in therapy kitchen/bathroom settings.
- **Adaptive Equipment Prescription**:  
  - Recommend suitable wheelchair, transfer boards, and bathroom safety aids.

### 2.3 Bladder Function Rehabilitation
- **Bladder Training**:  
  - Scheduled voiding with gradual interval extension.
  - Pelvic floor muscle exercises (Kegels) if feasible.
- **Fluid Management**:  
  - Adjust evening fluid intake to reduce nocturia.
- **Monitoring**:  
  - Bladder diary for frequency-volume assessment and progress tracking.

### 2.4 Psychological Intervention
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**:  
  - Address anxiety and depressive thoughts related to illness and disability.
- **Relaxation Techniques**:  
  - Guided imagery, breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation before bedtime.
- **Sleep Hygiene Education**:  
  - Fixed bedtime, stimulus control, limiting caffeine, optimizing bedroom environment.
- **Family Counseling**:  
  - Educate family on realistic expectations, supportive communication, and caregiving skills.

### 2.5 Speech and Cognitive Therapy (as needed)
- Although speech is intact, monitor for cognitive fatigue and attention deficits; implement compensatory strategies if deficits emerge.

### 2.6 Nursing and Safety Management
- **Fall Prevention**:  
  - Supervised mobility, proper footwear, clear pathways, use of gait belts during transfers.
- **Skin Care**:  
  - Daily inspection, maintain cleanliness, moisturize to prevent breakdown.
- **DVT Prophylaxis**:  
  - Encourage active ankle pumps, early mobilization, and limb elevation as appropriate.

### 2.7 Medical Management Coordination
- **Oncology Follow-up**:  
  - Coordinate with oncology for ongoing targeted therapy given EGFR mutation.
- **Pain and Spasticity Control**:  
  - Monitor for emerging spasticity; consider pharmacologic interventions if needed.
- **Sleep Disorder Management**:  
  - Collaborate with physician for possible pharmacologic adjuncts if non-drug measures insufficient.

### 2.8 Patient and Family Education
- Disease and rehabilitation process education.
- Safe transfer and mobility techniques.
- Importance of adherence to home exercise program.
