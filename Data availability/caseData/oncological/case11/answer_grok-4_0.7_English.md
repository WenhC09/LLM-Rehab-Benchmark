# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4-8 weeks):
- Improve left upper and lower limb muscle strength to MMT grade III+.
- Enhance sitting balance to grade III and standing balance to grade II.
- Increase Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score to 50/100, reducing ADL dependence to moderate level.
- Reduce fall risk by improving Berg Balance Scale score to 45/56.
- Improve sleep duration to 4-5 hours per night and reduce nocturnal urinary frequency to <10 episodes.
- Reduce Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) score to mild anxiety range and maintain or improve Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score.

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve left upper and lower limb muscle strength to MMT grade IV.
- Attain independent ambulation with assistive devices (FAC level 4-5) for short distances.
- Restore sitting and standing balance to grade IV.
- Increase MBI score to 70/100, achieving mild ADL dependence.
- Eliminate high fall risk (Berg Balance Scale score >50/56).
- Achieve 6-7 hours of uninterrupted sleep per night and normalize urinary frequency.
- Resolve anxiety symptoms (HAMA score within normal range) and maintain stable mood.

## Treatment Methods

### 1. Physical Therapy
- **Strength Training**:
  - Progressive resistance exercises for left upper limb (biceps, triceps, shoulder abductors) and lower limb (quadriceps, hamstrings) using light weights (0.5-1 kg) or resistance bands, 3 sets of 10 repetitions, 3 times/week.
  - Focus on active-assisted movements for left shoulder and hip to improve ROM (target: shoulder abduction to 120°, hip flexion to 110°).
- **Balance and Coordination Training**:
  - Seated balance exercises (e.g., reaching tasks, weight shifting) for 20 minutes/day, progressing to standing balance exercises with parallel bars or walker support.
  - Proprioceptive training using balance boards or foam pads, 15 minutes/day, 5 times/week.
- **Gait Training**:
  - Assisted ambulation with walker or cane for 10-15 meters, 2-3 times/day, progressing 20-30 meters as tolerated.
  - Focus on step symmetry and heel-toe gait pattern, monitored by Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC).
- **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**:
  - Apply NMES to left quadriceps, tibialis anterior, and biceps brachii to enhance muscle activation, 20 minutes/session, 3 times/week.

### 2. Occupational Therapy
- **Upper Limb Functional Training**:
  - Task-specific training (e.g., grasping, releasing objects) to improve left hand dexterity and Frenchay Arm Test (FTHUE) score, 30 minutes/day, 5 times/week.
  - Passive and active-assisted ROM exercises for left wrist and fingers to increase thumb joint mobility (target: thumb MP joint flexion to 60°, IP joint to 80°).
- **ADL Retraining**:
  - Practice grooming, dressing, and bed-chair transfers with adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled sponge, dressing stick), 30 minutes/day.
  - Train in compensatory techniques for bathing and toileting to reduce dependence, guided by MBI score improvement.

### 3. Speech and Swallowing Therapy
- Although swallowing function is normal (Kubota Water Swallowing Test), monitor for potential decline due to neurological status. Provide oral motor exercises to maintain function, 10 minutes/day, 3 times/week.

### 4. Psychological and Cognitive Interventions
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**:
  - Weekly 45-minute sessions with a clinical psychologist to address anxiety and mild depression, focusing on coping strategies for physical limitations and stress management.
- **Sleep Hygiene Education**:
  - Implement a structured sleep schedule, limiting daytime naps to <30 minutes and creating a relaxing bedtime routine (e.g., dim lighting, no screens 1 hour before bed).
  - Relaxation techniques (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery) for 15 minutes before bedtime to improve sleep onset.
- **Supportive Counseling**:
  - Biweekly family counseling sessions to manage expectations, reduce patient’s psychological stress, and enhance family support for rehabilitation goals.

### 5. Management of Neurogenic Bladder
- **Bladder Training**:
  - Scheduled voiding every 2-3 hours during the day to reduce frequency and train bladder capacity.
  - Monitor fluid intake (1.5-2 L/day, avoiding bladder irritants like caffeine) and maintain a bladder diary to track progress.
- **Consultation with Urologist**:
  - Refer for urodynamic testing to confirm neurogenic bladder and assess need for pharmacological intervention (e.g., anticholinergics for detrusor overactivity).

### 6. Fall Prevention and Safety
- **Environmental Modifications**:
  - Use of grab bars, raised toilet seat, and non-slip mats in patient’s living space to reduce fall risk.
  - Train patient and family in safe transfer techniques and use of assistive devices (walker, wheelchair).
- **Regular Monitoring**:
  - Weekly reassessment of Berg Balance Scale and fall risk score to adjust interventions as needed.

### 7. Nutritional and General Health Support
- **Nutritional Counseling**:
  - Maintain balanced diet (NRS-2002 score 1) with adequate protein (1.2-1.5 g/kg/day) to support muscle recovery and prevent fatigue.
  - Ensure hydration to support bladder management and overall health.
- **Medical Management**:
  - Coordinate with oncologist for ongoing management of lung adenocarcinoma and brain metastasis (e.g., targeted therapy for EGFR).
  - Monitor vital signs and adjust antihypertensive therapy if blood pressure exceeds 140/90 mmHg consistently.

### 8. Monitoring and Reassessment
- Weekly evaluations of MMT, ROM, Berg Balance Scale, and MBI to track progress and adjust intensity of interventions.
- Biweekly reassessment of HAMA and HAMD scores to evaluate psychological status.
- Monthly review of sleep quality and bladder diary to assess improvements in sleep and urinary frequency.
- Adjust plan based on patient’s tolerance, fatigue levels (Borg RPE), and any new symptoms related to oncological status.

### 9. Patient and Family Education
- Educate patient and family on rehabilitation exercises, fall prevention strategies, and bladder training techniques.
- Provide resources on coping with chronic illness and realistic goal-setting to align expectations with functional outcomes.
