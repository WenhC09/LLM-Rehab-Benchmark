### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-Term Goals (within 2-4 weeks):
*   **Mood & Sleep:** Improve sleep quality within 1 week; alleviate irritability, urinary frequency, poor appetite, and excessive rumination within 2-3 weeks.
*   **Physical Therapy:** Within 2 weeks, reduce left limb muscle tone, elicit dissociated movement, achieve left upper limb shoulder flexion to 90° with elbow extension for 10 repetitions; improve lower limb balance stability to perform 30 steps in place on a balance pad while maintaining stability.
*   **Occupational Therapy:** Within 2 weeks, enhance awareness of the patient and caregiver regarding protection of the affected limb (e.g., proper limb positioning) to prevent secondary injury; improve dressing ability to independently don/doff upper garments, pants, socks, and shoes.

#### Long-Term Goals (4 weeks and beyond):
*   **Mood & Psychological:** Achieve over 6 hours of nocturnal sleep within 4 weeks, restore mental alertness, stabilize mood, and build confidence in clinical treatment.
*   **Physical Therapy:** Within 4 weeks, enhance bilateral lower limb muscular endurance to ambulate continuously for 200 meters in the ward corridor without significant fatigue (Borg Scale score 1-2/10); achieve left single-leg stance for 10 seconds, complete 20 step-ups/step-downs, and reach Grade II standing balance.
*   **Occupational Therapy:** Within 4 weeks, achieve Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score indicating mostly independent Activities of Daily Living (ADL); improve active control of the trunk and affected upper limb to effectively assist the unaffected side in basic ADL, and perform complex activities (e.g., transfers, toileting, bathing) under supervision.

### 2. Treatment Methods

*   **Primary Disease Treatment:**
    *   Administer targeted therapy with osimertinib based on genetic testing results (EGFR 19-Del mutation).
    *   Provide symptomatic management for potential adverse effects of targeted therapy (e.g., rash, cytopenia).

*   **Psychiatric Treatment:**
    *   **Pharmacotherapy:**
        *   Alprazolam (0.8mg, QN) for sleep improvement.
        *   Paroxetine for anxiety and depression management.
    *   **Psychological Rehabilitation:**
        *   Implement music therapy and relaxation therapy for emotional regulation.
        *   Utilize Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to correct maladaptive cognitions and improve mood.

*   **Rehabilitation Therapy:**
    *   **Physical Therapy (PT):**
        *   **Manual Therapy:**
            *   Perform left glenohumeral joint mobilization to improve range of motion (ROM) in flexion, abduction, and internal rotation.
            *   Apply Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) techniques (e.g., resistance, joint approximation) to promote left upper limb motor recovery. Duration: 10 minutes/session, 1 session/day, 7 times/week.
            *   Perform sustained stretching (15-30 seconds hold, 5 times/day) for hypertonic muscles (e.g., biceps brachii, triceps surae).
        *   **Exercise Training:**
            *   **Strength & Endurance Training:** Utilize low-intensity, high-repetition principle with gravity-resisted exercises, elastic bands, sandbags, upper/lower limb MOTomed, and pneumatic pedals for progressive muscle strengthening and endurance. Duration: 10 minutes/session, 1 session/day, 7 times/week.
            *   **Balance Training:** Improve balance and stability limits (hip/ankle strategies) via single-leg stance on varied surfaces (e.g., floor, soft mat) combined with upper limb activities.
            *   **Gait Training:** Enhance automaticity of ambulation by incorporating dual-tasks (e.g., ball throwing/catching) or environmental obstacles.
        *   **Health Education:** Instruct patient on self-exercises (e.g., Bobath hand grasp with overhead reach) and supervised ambulation training, fostering correct rehabilitation awareness.
    *   **Occupational Therapy (OT):**
        *   **Training Plan:**
            *   **Health Education:** Educate patient and family on affected limb protection, proper positioning, shoulder subluxation prevention, and fall risk reduction.
            *   **Sensory Re-education:** Address sensory deficits using sensory boxes, Rood brushing, and active touch.
            *   **Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL) Training:** Task-specific training for dressing, grooming, bathing, transfers, and wheelchair use.
            *   **Recreational & Aerobic Training:** Incorporate aerobic exercises (e.g., table tennis, Baduanjin) based on patient interest.
            *   **Functional & Task-Oriented Training:** Employ upper limb robotics and motion capture to enhance limb control and endurance; implement task-specific training (e.g., block grasping for dressing preparation, bilateral water pipe manipulation).
        *   **Continuation Plan:**
            *   Guide patient to practice affected upper limb use in ADL (e.g., dressing simulation, simulated feeding, face washing/tooth brushing) in the ward.
            *   Perform seated cup-stacking tasks on a balance pad to improve trunk and upper limb control.

*   **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Treatment:**
    *   **Syndrome Differentiation:** Deficiency of lung-defense qi (肺卫气虚) with malnourishment of the heart spirit (心神失养).
    *   **Treatment Principle:** Tonify the lung and boost qi (补肺益气), nourish the heart and calm the spirit (养心安神).
    *   **Methods:**
        *   **Herbal Formula:** Modified Yupingfeng San (Jade Windscreen Powder) combined with Suanzaoren Tang (Sour Jujube Decoction), administered orally.
        *   **Acupuncture:**
            *   **Point Selection:** Neiguan (PC6), Renzhong (GV26), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Fengchi (GB20), Wangu (GB12), Yifeng (SJ17), Lianquan (CV23), Jinjin (EX-HN12), Yuye (EX-HN13), and posterior pharyngeal wall pricking.
            *   **Technique:** Apply specific reinforcing/reducing methods: Reducing by twisting-lifting-thrusting at PC6; Sparrow-pecking reducing at GV26; Lifting-thrusting reinforcing at SP6; Small-amplitude, high-frequency twisting reinforcing at GB20/GB12; Pricking for bloodletting at EX-HN12/EX-HN13/posterior pharyngeal wall. Concurrent peri-ocular, perioral, and facial point stimulation.

*   **Rehabilitation Nursing Guidance:**
    *   **Condition Monitoring:** Closely observe patient status and vital signs; report abnormalities promptly.
    *   **Psychological Care:** Provide emotional support, active listening, and encouragement; utilize distraction techniques (e.g., TV, music) to alleviate anxiety.
    *   **Sleep Management:** Ensure quiet, comfortable environment; schedule daytime activities to minimize napping; implement fluid intake plan to reduce nocturia.
    *   **Continuation of Functional Exercise:** Support rehabilitation carryover in the ward: Guide proper limb positioning, deliver fall prevention education, supervise Bobath hand grasp exercises, and encourage active use of the affected hand during ADL (dressing, grooming, toileting).
