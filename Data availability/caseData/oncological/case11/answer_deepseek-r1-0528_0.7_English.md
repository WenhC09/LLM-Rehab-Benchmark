# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2-4 weeks):
- Improve left upper limb strength from MMT II to II+ and lower limb from III to III+
- Achieve independent bed-chair transfers with minimal assistance
- Increase sitting balance from Grade II to Grade III
- Reduce HAMA score from moderate to mild anxiety range
- Establish basic sleep hygiene routine (increase nocturnal sleep to 3-4 continuous hours)
- Prevent secondary complications (contractures, falls, DVT)

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve modified independence in ADLs (MBI ≥60)
- Attain functional ambulation with single-point cane (FAC Level 4)
- Restore grasp function sufficient for basic self-care (FTHUE Level II)
- Normalize sleep architecture (5-6 hours uninterrupted sleep)
- Develop compensatory strategies for sensory deficits
- Manage urinary frequency (<8 daytime voids)

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy
- **Strength Training**: 
  - Progressive resistance exercises for left limbs (3 sets × 10 reps, 5x/week)
  - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to left wrist extensors and ankle dorsiflexors
- **Range of Motion**: 
  - Passive stretching for limited joints (shoulder abduction, hip flexion, wrist extension)
  - Active-assisted exercises using pulley system
- **Balance Training**:
  - Sitting balance drills on unstable surfaces (therapy ball)
  - Weight-shifting exercises with parallel bar support
  - Perturbation training during standing
- **Gait Rehabilitation**:
  - Partial body-weight support treadmill training (15 min/day)
  - Overground walking with hemi-walker

### Occupational Therapy
- **Upper Limb Function**:
  - Task-specific training for grasp/release (block stacking, pegboard)
  - Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) protocol
  - Custom thermoplastic resting hand splint for night use
- **ADL Retraining**:
  - Adaptive dressing techniques (hook-and-loop closures)
  - Toileting simulation with grab bars
  - Energy conservation strategies for grooming
- **Sensory Re-education**:
  - Texture discrimination training
  - Mirror therapy for sensory perception

### Psychological Intervention
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy**:
  - Anxiety management (relaxation breathing, guided imagery)
  - Activity pacing diary to address fatigue-anxiety cycle
- **Sleep Program**:
  - Stimulus control therapy (fixed bed/rise times)
  - Sleep restriction protocol (initially 4h time-in-bed)
- **Family Counseling**:
  - Education on realistic recovery expectations
  - Training in transfer techniques

### Nursing & Adjunctive Therapies
- **Bladder Management**:
  - Timed voiding schedule (every 2h daytime)
  - Fluid restriction protocol (no intake 2h pre-bed)
- **Fall Prevention**:
  - Environmental modifications (bed rails, non-slip mats)
  - Hip protectors during mobility training
- **Medical Coordination**:
  - Pharmacological review for sleep/anxiety (melatonin trial)
  - DVT prophylaxis monitoring (compression stockings + ankle pumps)
- **Fatigue Management**:
  - Activity pacing with Borg Scale feedback
  - Graded exercise program starting at <3 Borg level

> *Note: All interventions to be modified based on biweekly reassessment of MMT, Berg Scale, MBI, and HAMA scores. Oncology team coordination essential for monitoring disease status.*
