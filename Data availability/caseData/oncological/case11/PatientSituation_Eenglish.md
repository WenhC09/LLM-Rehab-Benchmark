# Medical Record Information

## Case Summary

A 61-year-old male presented for further rehabilitation due to left-sided limb motor dysfunction and sleep disturbances secondary to intracranial metastasis of lung cancer and post-operative status of frontal-parietal lobe tumor resection.

In May 2013, the patient underwent right lower lobectomy for lung adenocarcinoma followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. In September 2023, he developed dizziness with left limb numbness, leading to the discovery of an intracranial mass. Craniotomy for tumor resection was performed in October 2023, with pathology confirming metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Post-operatively, he exhibited left-sided limb weakness and severe dependence in activities of daily living (ADL), requiring wheelchair assistance for admission. The patient demonstrates awareness of his condition; however, functional decline has exacerbated anxiety, manifesting as poor nocturnal sleep, irritability, daytime drowsiness, and significant psychological stress. Family members hold high expectations for rehabilitation, hoping for a return to normal family life.

**Present Illness**: The patient underwent right lower lobectomy in May 2013, with pathology confirming adenocarcinoma. In September 2023, an intracranial mass measuring approximately $4.3 \mathrm{cm} \times 4.9 \mathrm{cm}$ was detected, with PET-CT suggesting right parietal lobe metastasis. Craniotomy for tumor resection was performed in October 2023. Postoperative pathology revealed (right frontal lobe) metastatic adenocarcinoma, with immunohistochemistry and genetic testing indicating EGFR exon 19 deletion (19-Del) mutation in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Left-sided limb weakness and severe ADL dependence persisted postoperatively. Since disease onset, the patient has exhibited lethargy, fair appetite, poor sleep, and significantly increased urinary frequency.

**Diagnoses**:
* Postoperative status of lung adenocarcinoma (right lower lobe) with brain metastasis (right frontal-parietal lobe) (EGFR exon 19-Del mutation type)
* Central paralysis (left hemiplegia)
* Balance dysfunction
* Sleep disorder
* Moderate anxiety state and mild depressive state
* Severe dependence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL)
* Suspected neurogenic bladder dysfunction
* High fall risk

## Pre-rehabilitation Quantitative Examination and Assessment

### Physical Examination

*   **Vital Signs**: Temperature $37.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, pulse 88 bpm, respiratory rate 20/min, blood pressure $130 / 90 \mathrm{mmHg}$.
*   **Neurological Examination**: Alert, fluent speech. Orientation, memory, and calculation abilities grossly intact. Bilateral pupils equal and round, reactive to light. Tongue protrusion essentially midline.
*   **Manual Muscle Testing (MMT)**: Left upper limb grade II, left hand grade II-, left lower limb grade III, right-sided limbs grade V.
*   **Range of Motion (ROM)**: Limited left shoulder abduction ($100^{\circ}$), limited left hip flexion ($90^{\circ}$), limited left wrist extension ($60^{\circ}$).
*   **Muscle Tone**: Left biceps brachii grade I, left triceps surae grade I.
*   **Reflexes**: Right-sided tendon reflexes (3+), left-sided tendon reflexes (+). Ankle clonus negative. Bilateral Babinski sign negative.
*   **Coordination**: Left-sided coordination tests non-cooperative.
*   **Balance Function**: Sitting balance grade II, standing balance grade I.

### Psychological Assessment

*   **Psychiatric Examination**: Clear consciousness, lethargic mood, cooperative. Depressed affect, distressed by limb dysfunction and ADL dependence. Significant anxiety symptoms including rumination and concerns about physical condition and treatment tolerance. Insight preserved.
*   **Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA)**: Moderate anxiety.
*   **Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD)**: Mild depression.

### Functional Assessment

*   **Sensory Function**: Diminished pinprick sensation below left elbow; absent temperature and light touch sensation; absent deep sensation. Tremor present during object manipulation with left hand.
*   **Ambulation Capacity**: Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC) level 3, unable to ambulate independently over long distances.
*   **Balance Capacity**: Berg Balance Scale score 37/56, indicating balance dysfunction and fall risk.
*   **Perceived Exertion**: Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) score 3 after walking ~10 meters.
*   **Upper Limb Function**: Frenchay Arm Test (FTHUE) level IV. Absent gross grasp in hand. Restricted finger joint mobility (thumb metacarpophalangeal joint flexion $0\sim 40^{\circ}$, thumb interphalangeal joint flexion $0\sim 70^{\circ}$). Inability to perform lateral pinch for block transfer.
*   **Activities of Daily Living**: Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score 38/100, indicating severe ADL dependence. Complete dependence in bathing, toileting, stair negotiation, and level walking (except bowel/bladder control). Severe dependence in grooming, dressing, and bed-chair transfers.

### Nursing Assessment

*   **Fall Risk**: Fall risk assessment score 60, high risk.
*   **Pressure Ulcer Risk**: Braden Scale score 20, low risk.
*   **Venous Thromboembolism Risk**: Padua Prediction Score 3.
*   **Nutritional Risk**: Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) score 1.
*   **Swallowing Function**: Kubota Water Swallowing Test normal.
*   **Sleep Status**: Poor sleep quality, nocturnal sleep duration 1-2 hours with inability to return to sleep after awakening.
*   **Elimination Status**: Marked urinary frequency: >10 episodes daytime, >20 episodes nocturnally, each with small volume. Bowel movements normal.
