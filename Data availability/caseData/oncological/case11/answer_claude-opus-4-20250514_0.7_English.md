# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
1. Improve left limb muscle strength to Grade III within 4 weeks.
2. Enhance range of motion (ROM) in the left shoulder, hip, and wrist to at least 120°, 100°, and 80°, respectively, within 6 weeks.
3. Increase sitting balance to Grade III and standing balance to Grade II within 4 weeks.
4. Reduce anxiety levels as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) by at least 25% within 6 weeks.

### Long-term goals:
1. Achieve functional independence in basic activities of daily living (ADLs) with a Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score of at least 60/100 within 12 weeks.
2. Improve ambulation capacity to Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC) Level 4 within 12 weeks.
3. Enhance upper limb function to Frenchay Arm Test (FTHUE) Level II within 12 weeks.
4. Establish a regular sleep pattern with at least 6 hours of nocturnal sleep within 12 weeks.

## Treatment Methods:
1. **Physical Therapy:**
   - **Strength Training:** Focus on progressive resistance exercises for the left upper and lower limbs, starting with isometric contractions and gradually increasing resistance as tolerated.
   - **Range of Motion Exercises:** Implement passive and active-assisted ROM exercises for the left shoulder, hip, and wrist to improve flexibility and prevent contractures.
   - **Balance Training:** Utilize balance exercises such as seated weight shifts, standing on one leg with support, and dynamic balance activities to enhance stability.
   - **Gait Training:** Initiate gait training with a focus on weight shifting and stepping patterns using assistive devices as needed.

2. **Occupational Therapy:**
   - **ADL Training:** Provide training in basic self-care tasks (bathing, dressing, grooming) using adaptive equipment to promote independence.
   - **Upper Limb Rehabilitation:** Engage in task-specific training to improve hand function, including grasping and manipulation exercises with therapeutic putty and objects of varying sizes.

3. **Psychological Support:**
   - **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Implement CBT techniques to address anxiety and depressive symptoms, focusing on coping strategies and stress management.
   - **Relaxation Techniques:** Teach relaxation methods such as deep breathing exercises and guided imagery to help reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality.

4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:**
   - Provide education on sleep hygiene practices, including establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a conducive sleep environment, and avoiding stimulants before bedtime.

5. **Multidisciplinary Team Approach:**
   - Collaborate with a dietitian to address nutritional needs and ensure adequate caloric intake to support recovery.
   - Regularly assess and monitor the patient's progress through interdisciplinary team meetings to adjust the rehabilitation plan as necessary.

6. **Patient and Family Education:**
   - Educate the patient and family about the rehabilitation process, setting realistic expectations, and encouraging active participation in the rehabilitation journey.
