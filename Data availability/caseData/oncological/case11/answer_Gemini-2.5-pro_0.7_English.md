# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 2-4 weeks):

*   **Safety and Mobility:** Achieve modified independence in bed mobility and transfers (bed to/from wheelchair) with verbal cues.
*   **Balance:** Improve static and dynamic sitting balance to Grade III (Good), enabling safe performance of seated ADLs without loss of balance.
*   **Ambulation:** Ambulate 20 meters with a quad cane and standby assistance on level surfaces, demonstrating proper gait sequence and safety awareness.
*   **Upper Limb Function:** Maintain full passive range of motion in the left upper limb. Patient will be able to use the left arm to assist in stabilizing his trunk during seated activities.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADLs):** Achieve minimal assistance for upper body dressing and grooming while seated.
*   **Psychological Well-being & Sleep:** Establish a consistent sleep hygiene routine and utilize relaxation techniques to achieve at least 4 hours of consolidated sleep per night, reducing daytime drowsiness.
*   **Bladder Management:** Implement a timed voiding schedule to reduce urinary frequency to less than 10 times during the day and less than 5 times at night.
*   **Patient/Family Education:** Patient and family will verbalize understanding of fall prevention strategies and demonstrate safe assistance for transfers.

### Long-term goals (by discharge):

*   **Ambulation:** Achieve supervised to modified independent ambulation for household distances (>50 meters) using a quad cane.
*   **Balance:** Improve standing balance to allow for standing without physical support for 2-3 minutes to complete ADLs (e.g., at a sink). Achieve a Berg Balance Scale score > 45.
*   **Upper Limb Function:** Utilize the left hand as a functional assist (e.g., stabilizing objects on a table, holding a piece of paper while writing with the right hand).
*   **ADLs:** Achieve modified independence (MBI > 60) in most self-care activities, including toileting and bathing, utilizing adaptive equipment as needed.
*   **Psychological Well-being:** Reduce anxiety and depression symptoms to a subclinical level (HAMA/HAMD scores in the normal range). Patient will report improved mood and effective coping strategies for managing his condition.
*   **Family Training:** Family members will be independent and confident in providing the necessary supervision and assistance for the patient's mobility and ADL routines in preparation for a safe discharge home.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy (PT)

*   **Neurophysiological Approaches:** Utilize Neurodevelopmental Treatment (NDT) and Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) techniques to inhibit abnormal tone, facilitate normal movement patterns, and improve motor control in the left limbs.
*   **Balance Training:**
    *   **Seated:** Progress from static to dynamic tasks, including reaching outside the base of support in multiple directions and responding to gentle perturbations.
    *   **Standing:** Initiate in parallel bars, focusing on static stance, weight shifting, and stepping. Progress to standing with decreasing upper limb support. Utilize visual feedback (mirror).
*   **Gait Training:**
    *   Begin in parallel bars to establish a safe and symmetrical gait pattern.
    *   Progress to overground ambulation with a wide-based quad cane for stability.
    *   Focus on improving weight-bearing on the left lower limb, hip and knee control, and foot clearance.
*   **Strength Training:**
    *   **Left Lower Limb (Grade III):** Focus on closed-chain exercises (e.g., sit-to-stands, bridging, mini-squats in parallel bars) to enhance functional strength.
    *   **Left Upper Limb (Grade II):** Active-assisted range of motion and gravity-eliminated exercises (e.g., using a powder board or sling suspension) to improve muscle activation.
    *   **Core and Right-sided Strengthening:** To improve stability and compensate for left-sided weakness.
*   **Range of Motion (ROM) and Flexibility:**
    *   Daily passive and active-assisted ROM exercises for all left-sided joints, with specific attention to the left shoulder, wrist, and hip to address identified limitations and prevent contractures.
    *   Gentle stretching for muscles with increased tone (left biceps, triceps surae).

### Occupational Therapy (OT)

*   **ADL Retraining:**
    *   Task-specific training for dressing, grooming, and bathing, beginning with seated activities.
    *   Introduce and train in the use of adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled sponge, sock aid, buttonhook, rocker knife) to promote independence.
*   **Upper Limb Functional Training:**
    *   **Sensory Re-education:** Given profound sensory loss, implement a program involving various textures, temperatures, and pressures to stimulate the left hand and arm. Provide proprioceptive input through weight-bearing and joint approximation.
    *   **Motor Training:** Utilize mirror therapy to promote motor recovery by activating mirror neurons. Employ mental practice/motor imagery techniques.
    *   **Bimanual Tasks:** Train the patient to incorporate the left upper limb as a stabilizer in bilateral activities.
*   **Splinting:** Fabricate a resting hand splint for the left hand to be worn at night and during periods of rest to prevent contracture and maintain a functional position.
*   **Transfer Training:** Focus on toilet and tub/shower transfer techniques, including training on the use of grab bars and a shower chair.

### Psychological and Behavioral Intervention

*   **Psychotherapy:** Schedule regular sessions of supportive psychotherapy to address adjustment to disability, anxiety about his condition, and depressive symptoms.
*   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**
    *   **For Anxiety/Depression:** Help the patient identify and challenge negative thought patterns related to his functional limitations and prognosis.
    *   **For Insomnia (CBT-I):** Implement stimulus control therapy and sleep restriction principles.
*   **Relaxation Training:** Teach techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery to manage anxiety and facilitate sleep onset.
*   **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide structured education on optimizing the sleep environment and daily routines (e.g., consistent wake-up time, avoiding caffeine/naps, creating a wind-down routine).

### Nursing and Medical Management

*   **Fall Prevention:** Maintain a high-risk fall prevention protocol: bed in low position, call bell within reach, non-slip footwear, clutter-free environment.
*   **Bladder Management:**
    *   Implement and monitor a timed voiding schedule (e.g., every 2 hours initially).
    *   Educate on fluid management, particularly limiting intake 2 hours before bedtime.
    *   Consult with the primary medical team regarding potential pharmacological interventions if behavioral strategies are insufficient.
*   **Medication Review:** Liaise with the primary oncology and neurology teams to optimize medical management, including considering a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic for short-term use to break the cycle of insomnia, and/or an SSRI for persistent anxiety/depression.
*   **Patient and Family Education:** Conduct regular family meetings to provide updates on progress, adjust expectations, provide hands-on training for assistance, and plan for necessary home modifications and equipment prior to discharge.
