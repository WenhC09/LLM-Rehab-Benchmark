### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

#### 1. Rehabilitation Goals  
**Short-term goals (1-4 weeks):**  
- Stabilize nutritional status (target albumin >30g/L)  
- Prevent aspiration complications through safe feeding protocols  
- Maintain joint ROM and prevent contractures  
- Achieve independent sitting balance (Berg ≥3)  
- Reduce pressure ulcer/fall risk scores by ≥50%  
- Transition from total ADL dependence to minimal assistance for basic self-care  

**Long-term goals (>4 weeks):**  
- Achieve FOIS Level IV (total oral diet with specific compensations)  
- Restore laryngeal function (MPT >5s)  
- Independent wheelchair mobility and transfers  
- ADL score >60 (modified independence)  
- Ambulate 10m with single-person assist (FAC Level 2)  

#### 2. Treatment Methods  
**A. Dysphagia Management**  
1. *Compensatory Strategies:*  
   - Strict NPO status with continued NG tube feeding  
   - Chin tuck posture during trial swallows (nectar-thick liquids only)  
   - Thermal-tactile stimulation before oral trials  
2. *Direct Therapy:*  
   - Shaker exercises (3x/day, supine position)  
   - Masako maneuver without food (5 reps/3 sets daily)  
   - Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) at 50% max pressure  
3. *Instrumental Monitoring:*  
   - Weekly V-VST with 5mL nectar-thick trials  
   - VFSS repeat after CRP normalization  

**B. Physical Rehabilitation**  
1. *Bed Mobility Program:*  
   - PROM: Bilateral shoulders/hips/knees (20 reps BID)  
   - AAROM: Cervical lateral rotation (10 reps TID)  
   - Progressive sitting tolerance (5min→30min 4x/day)  
2. *Strength Training:*  
   - Isometric quadriceps/gluteal contractions (10s hold/15 reps)  
   - NMES to quadriceps (30Hz, 10min BID)  
   - Progressive resistance training (initiate at 0.5kg ankle weights)  
3. *Balance Training:*  
   - Static sitting balance on edge of bed (eyes open→closed)  
   - Weight shifts with therapist assistance  

**C. Medical Coordination**  
1. *Nutritional Support:*  
   - High-protein tube feeds (1.5g/kg/day) + glutamine supplementation  
   - Strict glucose monitoring (pre/post nutritional delivery)  
2. *Infection Control:*  
   - Coordinate antibiotic/antifungal therapy timing with rehab sessions  
   - Incentive spirometry every 2hrs while awake  
3. *Wound Prevention:*  
   - 2-hour turning schedule with silicone foam dressings at bony prominences  
   - Moisture-wicking bedding for diaphoresis management  

**D. ADL & Communication Training**  
1. *Self-Care Adaptation:*  
   - NG tube care training using adaptive grips  
   - Bed bath with long-handled sponges  
2. *Voice Therapy:*  
   - Digital laryngeal massage (5min TID)  
   - Phonation exercises with Passy-Muir valve  
3. *Energy Conservation:*  
   - Pacing techniques during oral care/hygiene tasks  
   - Activity analysis with occupational therapist  

**E. Modifications & Precautions**  
- Suspend therapy if SpO₂ <92% or HR >120bpm  
- Limit cervical rotation to 30° until skull base healing confirmed  
- Continuous pulse oximetry during swallowing trials  
- Diabetic skin checks pre/post NMES application
