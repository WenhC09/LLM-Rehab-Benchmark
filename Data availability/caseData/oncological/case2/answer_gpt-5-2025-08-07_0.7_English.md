# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2–4 weeks)
1. **Medical stability support**: Maintain vital signs stability, control infection, and prevent complications such as aspiration pneumonia, pressure ulcers, and deep vein thrombosis.
2. **Nutritional improvement**: Increase caloric and protein intake to begin reversing severe malnutrition; target serum albumin >32 g/L and gradual weight gain.
3. **Swallowing safety**: Reduce aspiration risk during swallowing; maintain adequate hydration and nutrition via nasogastric feeding while initiating safe swallowing training.
4. **Basic posture tolerance**: Progress from full-time bed rest to tolerating upright sitting in bed or wheelchair for ≥20 minutes without severe discomfort.
5. **Muscle preservation**: Prevent further muscle atrophy and joint contractures via passive and assisted active range of motion.
6. **Pain and discomfort management**: Relieve oral ulcer pain, improve comfort to facilitate oral-motor exercises.
7. **Psychological support**: Reduce anxiety and fear associated with swallowing and movement.

### Long-term goals (3–6 months, depending on disease progression and treatment tolerance)
1. **Partial oral intake**: Achieve FOIS level ≥4 (partial oral diet with supplemental tube feeding) with safe swallowing strategies.
2. **Improved ADL independence**: Increase ADL score to ≥45 (transition from completely dependent to requiring moderate assistance).
3. **Functional mobility progress**: Achieve FAC level ≥1–2 (stand with assistance, possible short-distance walking with aid).
4. **Speech improvement**: Enhance vocal quality and maximum phonation time to >6 seconds; improve communication ability.
5. **Nutritional normalization**: BMI ≥18.5, serum albumin ≥35 g/L.
6. **Complication prevention**: Maintain integrity of skin, prevent aspiration pneumonia, avoid joint contractures.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 General Medical and Nursing Support
- **Infection control**: Continue anti-bacterial and anti-fungal therapy per infectious disease consultation; monitor inflammatory markers.
- **Metabolic control**: Maintain stable blood glucose within individualized target range for type 2 diabetes.
- **Pressure ulcer prevention**: Reposition every 2 hours; use pressure-relieving mattress and cushions.
- **Fall prevention**: Bedside rails, supervised transfers, and mobility.

### 2.2 Nutrition Management
- **Route**: Continue nasogastric tube feeding until swallowing safety improves; avoid oral trials of thin liquids.
- **Formula**: High-protein, high-calorie, diabetes-appropriate enteral formula.
- **Frequency**: Small, frequent feeds to reduce aspiration risk and improve tolerance.
- **Oral care**: Regular oral hygiene with non-irritating rinses to reduce infection risk and discomfort from ulcers.

### 2.3 Swallowing and Speech Rehabilitation
- **Swallowing therapy**:
  - Initiate indirect swallowing training: oral-motor exercises (lip closure, tongue movement, jaw opening), effortful swallow without food, Masako maneuver if tolerated.
  - Thermal-tactile stimulation to improve swallow reflex.
  - Laryngeal elevation exercises (Mendelsohn maneuver) with caution, considering fatigue and cranial nerve involvement.
  - Maintain NPO for unsafe consistencies; trial small amounts of pudding-thick consistency under therapist supervision as condition allows.
- **Compensatory strategies**:
  - Chin-tuck posture during swallowing.
  - Double swallow for residue clearance.
  - External laryngeal elevation facilitation by therapist.
- **Speech therapy**:
  - Breathing exercises for phonation support.
  - Vocal function exercises to improve glottic closure (within tolerance for left vocal cord paralysis).
  - Augmentative communication tools as needed.

### 2.4 Physical Rehabilitation
- **Positioning and posture training**:
  - Gradual progression from bed rest to upright sitting.
  - Supported sitting in wheelchair with adequate trunk support.
- **Range of motion**:
  - Passive and active-assisted ROM for all major joints twice daily.
  - Gentle cervical mobility exercises within pain-free range to prevent stiffness.
- **Muscle strengthening**:
  - Isometric exercises for cervical muscles.
  - Low-resistance, high-repetition strengthening for upper and lower limbs (grade III–IV MMT).
- **Balance training**:
  - Static sitting balance exercises, progressing to dynamic sitting and supported standing as tolerated.
- **Respiratory training**:
  - Incentive spirometry or deep breathing exercises to improve lung capacity and reduce infection risk.

### 2.5 Occupational Therapy
- **ADL training**:
  - Practice grooming, feeding (when safe orally), and simple self-care with adaptive equipment.
  - Educate caregivers on safe transfer techniques.
- **Energy conservation**:
  - Teach pacing strategies to manage fatigue.

### 2.6 Psychological and Social Support
- **Psychological counseling**:
  - Address anxiety, depression, and swallowing fear.
- **Patient and family education**:
  - Teach safe feeding strategies, aspiration signs, infection prevention, and home exercise programs.

### 2.7 Safety Precautions
- **Aspiration prevention**: Maintain upright posture ≥30 minutes after feeding; suction equipment available bedside.
- **Tube and catheter care**: Regular site inspection, secure fixation, sterile technique during handling.
- **Blood glucose monitoring**: Adjust feeding and insulin/medication accordingly.

**Plan review frequency**: Weekly multidisciplinary team review with adjustments based on patient tolerance, medical status, and functional progress.
