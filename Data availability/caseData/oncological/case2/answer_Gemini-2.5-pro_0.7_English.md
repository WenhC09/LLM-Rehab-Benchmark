### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

**Patient:** 58-year-old male  
**Date of Plan:** January 4, 2023  
**Primary Diagnoses for Rehabilitation:** Severe dysphagia, motor dysfunction, and profound deconditioning secondary to nasopharyngeal carcinoma, multiple surgical interventions, infections, and severe malnutrition.

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

Given the patient's current medical instability (active infections, severe cachexia, ECOG 4 status), the initial phase of rehabilitation will prioritize medical stabilization, prevention of secondary complications, and establishment of foundational functional capacity. Therapy intensity will be low and guided by daily medical status and tolerance.

#### Short-term goals (Next 2-4 weeks):

1.  **Prevent Secondary Complications:**
    *   Maintain full passive range of motion (ROM) in all extremities to prevent contractures.
    *   Implement and adhere to a strict turning and positioning schedule (every 2 hours) to prevent pressure ulcer development.
    *   Improve respiratory function to prevent pulmonary complications, demonstrated by effective secretion clearance with assistance.
2.  **Improve Foundational Motor Control:**
    *   Improve neck muscle strength to MMT Grade II+ to allow for supported head control.
    *   Achieve tolerance to sitting upright in bed with back support for at least 20 minutes, twice daily, without significant vital sign changes.
    *   Tolerate active-assisted range of motion (AAROM) exercises for all extremities for 15-minute sessions daily.
3.  **Enhance Swallowing Safety and Oral Care:**
    *   Establish a consistent oral hygiene program (4 times daily) to reduce oral bacterial load and manage xerostomia.
    *   Tolerate indirect swallowing therapy (e.g., oral motor exercises) without excessive fatigue.
    *   Demonstrate improved management of own saliva with reduced pooling, guided by SLP cues.
4.  **Patient and Family Education:**
    *   Educate the patient and family on the rehabilitation process, rationale for the current NPO (Nil Per Os) status, and the importance of nutritional support.
    *   Train family members in proper positioning and passive ROM techniques.

#### Long-term goals (Next 3-6 months):

1.  **Improve Functional Mobility:**
    *   Achieve independent bed mobility (rolling, moving up/down in bed).
    *   Perform sit-to-stand transfers with minimal to moderate assistance.
    *   Achieve a Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) score of 1 or 2 (ambulation in parallel bars or with physical assistance of one person for balance/support).
2.  **Enhance Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Independence:**
    *   Achieve modified independence in feeding (with appropriate diet consistency) and grooming while seated.
    *   Achieve an ADL score of >40.
3.  **Improve Swallowing Function and Nutrition:**
    *   Advance to a safe oral diet of at least pureed consistency to supplement tube feedings (FOIS Level IV).
    *   Wean from indwelling urinary catheter.
4.  **Improve Communication and Endurance:**
    *   Increase maximum phonation time to >5 seconds.
    *   Tolerate 30-minute sessions of integrated PT, OT, and SLP therapy daily.

### 2. Treatment Methods

An interdisciplinary approach is critical. All therapies will be coordinated with the primary medical team to ensure patient safety, with constant monitoring of vital signs, fatigue, and nutritional status.

#### A. Physical Therapy (PT)

*   **Positioning and Bed Mobility:**
    *   Implement a 2-hour turning schedule. Use pillows and wedges to offload pressure points, especially sacrum, heels, and trochanters.
    *   Bed mobility training: Begin with instruction in bridging and progress to assisted rolling.
*   **Range of Motion and Strengthening:**
    *   **Passive ROM:** Twice daily for all joints of the upper and lower extremities.
    *   **Active-Assisted/Active ROM:** As tolerated, focusing on gravity-eliminated planes initially.
    *   **Strengthening:**
        *   Initiate isometric exercises for quadriceps, gluteals, and cervical musculature (gentle, submaximal contractions).
        *   Begin core stabilization exercises in supine (e.g., pelvic tilts).
*   **Respiratory Therapy:**
    *   Diaphragmatic breathing and deep breathing exercises to improve lung volume.
    *   Assisted cough techniques to facilitate secretion clearance.
*   **Functional Training:**
    *   Gradual elevation of the head of the bed to improve orthostatic tolerance.
    *   Once stable, progress to sitting at the edge of the bed with maximal support, focusing on static sitting balance.

#### B. Occupational Therapy (OT)

*   **ADL Retraining:**
    *   Focus on bed-level ADLs: self-grooming (face/hand washing, combing hair) with setup assistance and adaptive equipment.
    *   Incorporate tasks into functional movements (e.g., reaching for objects to improve shoulder ROM).
*   **Upper Extremity Management:**
    *   AAROM and AROM for shoulders, elbows, wrists, and hands.
    *   Gentle grip strengthening exercises (e.g., with soft foam).
*   **Energy Conservation and Work Simplification:**
    *   Educate patient on pacing, prioritizing tasks, and resting before fatigue sets in.
*   **Cognitive and Perceptual Assessment:**
    *   Monitor for signs of delirium or cognitive changes secondary to severe illness and provide orientation cues as needed.

#### C. Speech and Language Therapy (SLP)

*   **Dysphagia Management:**
    *   **Current Status:** Strict NPO. All nutrition and hydration via nasogastric tube.
    *   **Oral Hygiene:** Aggressive oral care program to be performed by nursing staff and family (after training) pre- and post-tube feedings and at regular intervals to manage xerostomia and reduce aspiration risk from colonized secretions.
    *   **Indirect Therapy (without food):**
        *   Oral motor exercises to improve labial, lingual, and buccal strength and ROM, respecting fatigue.
        *   Laryngeal elevation exercises (e.g., modified Mendelsohn maneuver, effortful pitch glides).
        *   Pharyngeal strengthening (e.g., Masako maneuver, effortful swallow).
        *   Head lift exercise (Shaker exercise) if cervically cleared and tolerated.
    *   **Compensatory Strategies:** Rehearse strategies like the chin tuck and head turn (to the left, given left-sided weakness) with saliva swallows.
    *   **Re-assessment:** Plan for repeat clinical swallow evaluation in 2-3 weeks, or when medically improved, to determine readiness for trials of therapeutic oral intake (e.g., ice chips, small bolus of puree).
*   **Voice Therapy:**
    *   Focus on improving respiratory support for phonation via coordination with PT's respiratory exercises.
    *   Introduce vocal function exercises at low intensity to improve glottic closure and reduce breathiness.
*   **Communication:**
    *   Ensure patient has a reliable means of communicating basic needs (e.g., call bell, simple picture/word board, or writing tablet).

#### D. Medical and Nutritional Management

*   **Nutritional Support:**
    *   Collaborate closely with the physician and dietitian to optimize enteral nutrition formula and rate to correct severe malnutrition and support immune function.
    *   Monitor weekly weight, albumin, and prealbumin levels. Rehabilitation progress is contingent on nutritional recovery.
*   **Medical Monitoring:**
    *   Therapy sessions to be conducted only when the patient is afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
    *   Closely monitor for signs of fatigue, pain, or distress during all activities, and adjust the plan accordingly.
    *   Coordinate with nursing for catheter management and skin integrity checks.
