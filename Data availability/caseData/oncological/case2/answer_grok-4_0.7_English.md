# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (1-4 weeks):
- **Nutritional Status**: Improve nutritional status by increasing albumin levels to >30 g/L and stabilizing body weight to reduce cachexia.
- **Infection Control**: Manage bacterial, fungal, and COVID-19 infections to reduce C-reactive protein to <10 mg/L and clinical symptoms.
- **Swallowing Safety**: Improve swallowing safety to reduce aspiration risk, targeting a Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS) score of level III or higher.
- **Muscle Strength**: Increase cervical muscle strength to grade III and maintain limb muscle strength at grade IV.
- **Functional Mobility**: Improve sitting balance to achieve a Berg Balance Scale score of ≥10 points, enabling stable sitting in a wheelchair.
- **ADL Support**: Enhance independence in basic activities of daily living (ADL) to achieve a score of ≥35 points, focusing on partial self-care with assistance.

### Long-term Goals (4-12 weeks):
- **Nutritional Recovery**: Achieve BMI >18.5 and normalize albumin (>35/L) and total protein levels (>65 g/L) to support functional recovery.
- **Swallowing Function**: Restore oral intake to achieve a Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) score of level IV or higher, enabling safe consumption of modified diets without aspiration.
- **Speech and Communication**: Improve phonation time to >5 seconds and reduce breathiness for functional communication.
- **Mobility and Strength**: Achieve cervical muscle strength of grade IV and limb muscle strength of grade V, enabling transfers with minimal assistance.
- **Functional Ambulation**: Progress to Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) level 2, allowing ambulation with physical assistance.
- **ADL Independence**: Attain ADL score of ≥60 points, enabling moderate independence in daily activities.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Nutritional Support
- **Enteral Nutrition**: Continue nasogastric tube feeding with a high-protein, high-calorie formula (1.5 kcal/mL, 80-100 g protein/day) to address severe malnutrition, monitored by a dietitian to achieve 25-30 kcal/kg/day and 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day protein.
- **Parenteral Nutrition**: Utilize PICC line for supplemental parenteral nutrition if enteral intake is insufficient, ensuring electrolyte balance and monitoring for refeeding syndrome.
- **Weekly Monitoring**: Track weight, albumin, and total protein levels weekly to adjust nutritional plan as needed.

### B. Infection Management
- **Antimicrobial Therapy**: Continue targeted antibiotic and antifungal therapy as prescribed by infectious disease specialists, with weekly monitoring of C-reactive protein and clinical signs of infection.
- **COVID-19 Management**: Follow isolation protocols and provide supportive care (oxygen therapy if needed) per infectious disease guidelines, with daily monitoring of respiratory status.

### C. Sw and Speech Rehabilitation
- **Swallowing Therapy**:
  - **Orofacial Exercises**: Implement passive and active range-of-motion exercises for lips, tongue, and jaw (10 repetitions, 3 sets daily) to address limited mouth opening and tongue atrophy.
  - **Mendelsohn Maneuver**: Train improve laryngeal elevation (5-10 repetitions, 3 sessions/day) under speech-language pathologist (SLP) supervision to enhance swallowing coordination.
  - **Effortful Swallow Training**: Practice with nectar-thick liquids (5-10 mL boluses, 10 repetitions, 2 sessions/day) to reduce pharyngeal residue and improve swallowing efficacy.
  - **Compensatory Strategies**: Use chin-tuck posture during swallowing attempts to minimize aspiration risk, guided by SLP.
  - **Thermal-Tactile Stimulation**: Apply to improve oral sensory function, particularly for the left tongue, 3 times/day.
- **Speech Therapy**:
  - **Vocal Exercises**: Perform breath support and vocal fold adduction exercises (e.g., sustained phonation, pitch glides, 5-10 repetitions, 2 sessions/day) to address breathy voice and left vocal cord paralysis.
  - **Maximum Phonation Time Training**: Practice sustained vowel phonation to increase duration to >5 seconds over 4 weeks.
- **Instrumental Feedback**: Schedule follow-up Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) in 2-4 weeks to reassess swallowing safety and adjust therapy.

### D. Physical and Occupational Therapy
- **Physical Therapy**:
  - **Cervical Muscle Strengthening**: Use isometric exercises (e.g., head resistance in flexion/extension, 5-10 seconds hold, 10 repetitions, 3 sets/day) to improve cervical muscle strength to grade III.
  - **Limb Strengthening**: Implement progressive resistance exercises for limbs (e.g., seated leg press, arm curls with light resistance, 10-12 repetitions, 2 sets/day) to maintain grade IV strength.
  - **Passive Range of Motion (ROM)**: Perform daily passive ROM for shoulders, hips, and knees (10 repetitions/joint) to prevent contractures.
  - **Sitting Balance Training**: Practice supported sitting with dynamic tasks (e.g., reaching exercises, 10-15 minutes/day) to improve Berg Balance Scale score.
  - **Transfer Training**: Begin bed-to-wheelchair transfer training with maximal assistance, progressing to moderate assistance as strength improves.
- **Occupational Therapy**:
  - **ADL Training**: Focus on basic self-care tasks (e.g., feeding with adaptive utensils, grooming with assistance, 15-20 minutes/day) to ADL score.
  - **Upper Limb Coordination**: Use fine motor (e.g., pegboard exercises, 10-15 minutes/day) to enhance functional use of upper limbs.

### E. Fall and Pressure Ulcer Prevention
- **Fall Prevention**: Use wheelchair with safety straps during transfers, ensure bed rails are up, and maintain a clutter-free environment. Reassess fall risk weekly.
- **Pressure Ulcer Prevention**: 2-hourly repositioning, use pressure-relieving mattress, and apply barrier creams to high-risk areas (sacrum, heels). Monitor skin integrity daily.

### F. Psychological and Social Support
- **Psychological Support**: Provide weekly counseling sessions to address fear of swallowing and emotional distress related to severe illness and dependency.
- **Family Education**: Educate caregivers on safe feeding techniques, transfer assistance, and infection control measures to support home care planning.

### G. Monitoring and Reassessment
- **Weekly Multidisciplinary Review**: Conduct team meetings (physician, SLP, physical/occupational therapists, dietitian) to evaluate progress on nutritional, swallowing, and functional goals.
- **Reassessment Schedule**:
  - Week 2: Repeat swallowing assessment (V-VST, FOIS, DOSS) and nutritional markers.
  - Week 4: Reassess muscle strength (MMT), balance (Berg Balance Scale), and ADL score.
  - Week 4-6: Schedule repeat VFSS to guide progression to oral intake.

### H. Precautions
- **Aspiration Risk**: Avoid thin liquids and solid foods until swallowing safety improves (DOSS ≥ level III).
- **Infection Monitoring**: Watch for signs of worsening infection (fever, increased CRP) and adjust therapy accordingly.
- **Fatigue Management**: Limit therapy sessions to 20-30 minutes each to prevent overexertion, given the patient’s cachectic state.
- **Diabetes Control**: Monitor blood glucose daily to ensure stability during nutritional interventions.
