### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-Term Goals (Within 8 weeks, preparing for radiotherapy)
*   **Medical Level:** Prevent bed rest syndrome, improve nutritional status and immune function, maintain homeostasis.
*   **Rehabilitation Level:** Prevent orthostatic hypotension; Achieve 70째 head-of-bed elevation and maintain sitting position for 20 minutes within 3 weeks; Maintain sitting at bedside for 20 minutes under supervision within 6 weeks. Enhance muscle endurance and balance of extremities, ascend/descend 2 flights of stairs with minimal assistance. Increase mouth opening to 28mm, improve Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) score to Level III, and Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS) score to Level IV.
*   **Nursing Level:** Maintain indwelling catheters, monitor nutritional status, alleviate oral discomfort, prevent pressure injuries and falls.

#### Long-Term Goals (Within 6 months, preparing for home reintegration)
*   **Motor Function:** Continuously enhance muscle endurance of extremities; Maintain standing for 10 minutes under supervision within 2 months; Achieve independent sit-to-stand transfers and walk 20 meters indoors under supervision within 4 months; Attain standing balance Level III and achieve independent ambulation within 6 months.
*   **Swallowing & Self-Care Ability:** Remove all indwelling catheters, achieve oral intake of multiple food textures using compensatory strategies (FOIS score improved to Level V), comprehensively enhance Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and ultimately return home.

### 2. Treatment Methods

#### Phase I: Pre-Radiotherapy Preparation
This phase combines clinical treatment with physical rehabilitation to eliminate cachexia and infection, preparing for radiotherapy.

*   **General & Nutritional Support:** Provide symptomatic treatments (e.g., expectorants, anti-infectives, energy supplementation). Combine enteral nutrition (e.g., whey albumin, Fresubin Diabetes, protein powder) and parenteral nutrition (IV human albumin, amino acids, fat emulsion) to rapidly improve cachexia.
*   **Psychological & Anti-Tumor Therapy:** Psychologist assessment and intervention for psychological burden (e.g., sudden deafness). Administer PD-1 immunotherapy as anti-tumor regimen pending radiotherapy completion.
*   **Rehabilitation Therapy:**
    *   **Swallowing & Speech Training:**
        *   *Muscle Fibrosis Relief:* Perform sustained head/neck stretching and active/passive mouth-opening exercises.
        *   *Oropharyngeal Strength Enhancement:* Implement Mendelsohn maneuver, Shaker exercise (head-lift), and Masako maneuver (tongue-hold swallow).
        *   *Airway Protection:* Practice supraglottic swallow and super-supraglottic swallow.
        *   *Laryngeal Elevation Improvement:* Perform effortful swallow.
        *   *Communication Efficiency:* Utilize Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).
        *   *Therapeutic Feeding:* Trial soft/moist foods (e.g., short noodles, tofu) under therapist guidance.
    *   **Physical Therapy:**
        *   *Postural Adaptation Training:* Begin sitting at 30째 head elevation for 15-30 minutes to prevent orthostatic hypotension. Increase by 15째 every 2-3 days until tolerating 90째 sitting.
        *   *Muscle Strength Training:* Upper limbs: 0.5kg sandbag resistance for shoulder flexion/adduction/abduction. Lower limbs: Anti-gravity single-joint exercises (hip flexion/extension/abduction, knee flexion/extension). 10 reps/set, 3 sets/day.
        *   *Muscle Endurance Training:* Use lower limb active/passive motion trainer or cycle ergometer for 40 minutes/day with continuous vital sign monitoring; avoid breath-holding.
        *   *Balance & Gait Training:* Incorporate ball-tossing activities into balance training to enhance engagement. 10 minutes/session, once daily.
    *   **Manual Therapy:** Perform 15-30s muscle stretching post-exercise. Use fascial gun or manual pressure for muscle relaxation and recovery.
    *   **Patient Education:** Provide encouragement and positive reinforcement to build rehabilitation confidence.
*   **Nursing Plan:** Focus on oral care (concentrated tinidazole gargle solution + artificial saliva spray), respiratory care (nebulization, back percussion, effective coughing instruction), and enteral nutrition management. Reinforce psychological support and implement strict fall prevention/skin care protocols.

#### Phase II: Concurrent Radiotherapy Phase
Aim: Support radiotherapy completion while minimizing adverse effects.

*   **Nutritional & Pharmacological Support:** Suspend complementary foods; increase enteral nutrition volume; supplement IV amino acids/fat emulsion. Manage radiotherapy adverse effects with: Nivolumab (suspended during radiotherapy, resumed post-treatment); oral Aescuven Forte (reducing mucosal edema); Kangfuxin Liquid (American cockroach extract) and topical Recombinant Human Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (rb-bFGF, Fusi Fu) for mucosal/wound healing.
*   **Rehabilitation Therapy:**
    *   *Training Adjustment:* Suspend limb muscle strength/endurance, balance, and ADL training.
    *   *Swallowing/Speech Maintenance:* Suspend therapeutic feeding. Continue head/neck stretching and mouth-opening exercises within tolerance. Maintain pharyngeal/tongue strength via effortful swallow and reading/chanting practices.
*   **Nursing Plan:** Prioritize head/neck skin and oral mucosa care. Guide patients on nail trimming and moisturizer use for skin; apply growth factor spray for oral mucosa. Provide psychosocial support through success story sharing.

#### Phase III: Comprehensive Rehabilitation & Functional Recovery Phase
Aim: Gradually reduce medication dependence, remove nasogastric tube, enhance ADL, and achieve home discharge.

*   **Nutritional & Pharmacological Adjustment:* Discontinue IV nutrition; maintain enteral support while progressively reducing formula and increasing complementary foods. Gradually taper Fusi Fu, Kangfuxin Liquid, and Aescuven Forte; supplement with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) conditioning. Complete PD-1 immunotherapy course.
*   **Comprehensive Rehabilitation Training:**
    *   *Restorative Training:* Fully resume swallowing, speech, limb strength/endurance, balance, and ADL training.
    *   *Advanced Training:* Transition from restorative exercises (e.g., postural training, sit-to-stand, sit-to-walk) to advanced training by increasing intensity, adding unstable surface balance challenges, and integrating complex movements.
*   **Nursing Plan:** Focus on tube removal care. Post-nasogastric tube removal, conduct immediate water swallow screening, monitor meal intake, and supervise continued rehabilitation exercises in the ward.
