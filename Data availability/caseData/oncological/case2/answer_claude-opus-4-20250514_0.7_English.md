### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

#### 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
**Short-term goals:**
- Improve nutritional status and manage severe malnutrition.
- Enhance swallowing safety and efficacy to reduce choking risk.
- Increase muscle strength in all extremities to facilitate basic mobility.
- Improve communication abilities and reduce speech dysfunction.
- Stabilize medical conditions, including infections and diabetes management.

**Long-term goals:**
- Achieve independence in activities of daily living (ADL) to the highest possible level.
- Restore functional ambulation and balance to enable safe mobility.
- Enhance overall quality of life through improved physical and psychological well-being.
- Facilitate effective communication and swallowing to allow for safe oral intake.

#### 2. Treatment Methods:
- **Nutritional Support:**
  - Implement a high-calorie, high-protein diet via nasogastric tube feeding, ensuring adequate hydration and electrolyte balance.
  - Regular nutritional assessments to monitor progress and adjust feeding plans as necessary.

- **Swallowing Rehabilitation:**
  - Initiate swallowing therapy focusing on safe swallowing techniques and compensatory strategies.
  - Use of thickened liquids and soft foods as tolerated, with gradual progression based on swallowing assessments.
  - Conduct regular swallowing assessments to monitor improvements and adjust therapy accordingly.

- **Physical Rehabilitation:**
  - Begin with passive range of motion (ROM) exercises to maintain joint mobility and prevent contractures.
  - Progress to active-assisted and active ROM exercises as tolerated to enhance muscle strength and endurance.
  - Implement strength training exercises targeting major muscle groups, focusing on gradual increases in resistance.

- **Speech and Language Therapy:**
  - Engage a speech-language pathologist to address speech dysfunction and improve communication skills.
  - Utilize exercises to enhance laryngeal function and vocal quality, including breath support and phonation exercises.

- **Functional Mobility Training:**
  - Introduce transfer training and wheelchair mobility to promote independence in movement.
  - Implement balance training exercises to reduce fall risk and improve stability.

- **Psychosocial Support:**
  - Provide psychological support to address anxiety related to swallowing and communication difficulties.
  - Involve family members in the rehabilitation process to enhance support and motivation.

- **Monitoring and Follow-up:**
  - Regularly assess progress in all areas of rehabilitation, adjusting the treatment plan as necessary based on patient response and clinical stability.
  - Coordinate care with the multidisciplinary team to ensure comprehensive management of medical and rehabilitation needs.
