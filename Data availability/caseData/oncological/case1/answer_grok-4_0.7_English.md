# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

###-term Goals (4-8 weeks):
- **Motor Function**: Improve left upper limb muscle strength to at least Grade III (Manual Muscle Testing) for shoulder, elbow, and wrist movements; improve left lower limb strength to Grade IV for tibialis anterior and triceps surae.
- **Balance**: Increase Berg Balance Scale score to ≥30/56, achieving Standing Balance Level II (maintaining static balance without support for 30 seconds).
- **Gait**: Increase walking distance to 200m indoors with a quad cane under supervision, improving walking speed to ≥0.4 m/s, and reduce compensatory gait patterns (e.g., foot drop, knee hyperextension).
- **ADL**: Improve Modified Barthel Index score to ≥85/100, achieving independence in dressing and minimal assistance in bathing.
- **Pain and Spasticity**: Reduce left limb spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale) by one level and decrease pain to improve sleep quality.
- **Cognition**: Enhance attention and immediate recall through cognitive training, targeting a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score improvement to ≥15/30.

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- **Motor Function**: Achieve left upper limb strength of Grade IV and lower limb strength of Grade V for functional movements, enabling basic grasping and weight-bearing tasks.
- **Balance**: Achieve Berg Balance Scale score ≥40/56, allowing independent standing and dynamic balance for community ambulation.
- **Gait**: Ambulate 500m outdoors with a single-point cane independently, with walking speed ≥0.6 m/s and minimal gait deviations.
- **ADL**: Achieve full independence in basic ADLs (Modified Barthel Index ≥95/100) and partial independence in instrumental ADLs (e.g., shopping, medication management).
- **Cognition and Community Reintegration**: Improve MoCA score to ≥20/30, enabling participation in simple community activities (e.g., basic communication, shopping) with family support.
- **Quality of Life**: pain-free status, improve sleep quality, and enhance participation in social activities to support emotional well-being.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy (5 sessions/week, 60 minutes/session)
- **Motor Training**:
  - **Left Upper Limb**: Progressive resistance training (e.g., Theraband exercises, light weights ≤1kg) targeting shoulder flexors, abductors, elbow flexors/extensors, and wrist extensors. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) for 30 minutes daily to encourage use of the left arm, focusing on repetitive task practice (e.g., reaching, grasping small objects).
  - **Left Lower Limb**: Functional strength training for iliopsoas, quadriceps, and tibialis anterior using body-weight exercises (e.g., partial squats, step-ups). Ankle dorsiflexion exercises with resistance bands to address foot drop.
- **Spasticity Management**:
  - Stretching exercises for left calf, hamstrings, and upper limb flexors (10-15 minutes daily, holding each stretch for 30 seconds).
  - Consider referral to a neurologist for potential oral baclofen (5-10 mg TID) or botulinum toxin injection if spasticity persists (Modified Ashworth Scale >2).
- **Balance Training**:
  - Sitting balance: Dynamic tasks (e.g., reaching for objects in different directions while seated) for 10 minutes.
  - Standing balance: Weight-shifting exercises, single-leg stance with support, and use of balance boards for 15 minutes. Progress to tandem stance and standing on foam surfaces as tolerated.
- **Gait Training**:
  - Treadmill training with partial body-weight support (20% weight relief) to improve gait symmetry and speed (15 minutes/session).
  - Overground walking with quad cane, focusing on heel strike and reducing knee hyperextension (15 minutes/session).
  - Functional electrical stimulation (FES) for tibialis anterior to address foot drop (20 minutes, 3 sessions/week).
- **Cardiopulmonary Endurance**:
  - Stationary cycling at low resistance (10-15 minutes, Borg Dyspnea Scale target ≤3/10) to improve endurance.

### Occupational Therapy (4 sessions/week, 45 minutes/session)
- **ADL Training**:
  - Task-specific training for dressing (e.g., donning/doffing shirts, pants) using adaptive techniques and devices (e.g., button hooks, elastic shoelaces) to promote independence.
  - Bathing practice with adaptive equipment (e.g., shower chair, long-handled sponge) under supervision.
- **Upper Limb Functional Training**:
  - Fine motor tasks (e.g., picking up coins, buttoning) to improve finger dexterity and coordination.
  - Bilateral task training (e.g., folding towels, opening jars) to integrate left arm use in functional activities.
- **Cognitive Rehabilitation**:
  - Attention training: Computer-based tasks (e.g., sustained attention exercises) and real-world tasks (e.g., sorting objects by category) for 15 minutes.
  - Memory aids: Use of memory notebooks or smartphone apps for daily scheduling and reminders.
  - Visuospatial training: Activities like tracing patterns or navigating simple maps to improve spatial orientation.

### Speech and Cognitive Therapy (3 sessions/week, 30 minutes/session)
- **Cognitive Training**:
  - Structured tasks to improve executive function and attention (e.g., planning daily activities, problem-solving scenarios).
  - Memory training: Repetition and association techniques for immediate and short-term recall (e.g., recalling word lists, daily events).
- **Communication Skills**:
  - Practice structured conversations to improve coherence and reduce irrelevant responses.
  - Use of augmentative communication aids (e.g., picture boards) if verbal expression remains limited.

### Pain and Psychosocial Management
- **Pain Management**:
  - Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for left limb pain (20 minutes, 3 sessions/week).
  - Consultation with a pain specialist for potential non-opioid analgesics (e.g., gabapentin 300 mg TID) if pain persists.
- **Psychosocial Support**:
  - Weekly counseling sessions with a clinical psychologist to address emotional adjustment, coping with cognitive deficits, and sleep disturbances.
  - Family education sessions (1 session/week) to teach compensatory strategies and support patient’s reintegration goals.

### Assistive Devices and Home Modifications
- **Mobility Aids**: Continue use of quad cane for indoor ambulation; transition to single-point cane as balance improves. Consider ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) for left foot drop if FES is insufficient.
- **ADL Aids**: Provide adaptive equipment (e.g., reacher, sock aid) to enhance independence in dressing and bathing.
- **Home Environment**: grab bars in bathroom, removal of trip hazards, and a shower chair for safe bathing.

### Monitoring and Reassessment
- **Weekly Monitoring**: Assess muscle strength (Manual Muscle Testing), spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale), and pain levels.
- **Biweekly Reassessment**: Re-evaluate Berg Balance Scale, walking speed/distance, and Modified Barthel Index to track progress.
- **Monthly Cognitive Assessment**: Repeat MoCA to monitor cognitive improvements and adjust therapy as needed.
- **Multidisciplinary Team Meetings**: Weekly meetings with physical, occupational, and speech therapists, neurologist, and psychologist to coordinate care and adjust the plan based on progress.

### Patient and Family Education
- Educate patient and family on the importance of consistent therapy adherence and home exercise programs (e.g., daily stretching, balance exercises).
- Provide written instructions for home-based tasks (e.g., dressing practice, memory exercises) and safety precautions during ambulation.
- Discuss realistic expectations for recovery, emphasizing gradual improvement in function and independence.
