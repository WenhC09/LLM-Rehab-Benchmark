### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-term Goals (Within 2 weeks):
Reduce muscle tone in the left upper limb, promote isolated movement and improve muscle strength, aiming to achieve 90° elbow flexion with the arm in a natural dependent position while seated. Elicit voluntary flexion-extension of the left elbow joint to modify flexor spasticity patterns. Train the patient in adaptive dressing techniques to independently control left elbow flexion/extension for donning/doffing cardigans with the unaffected side. Cognitively, improve attention and immediate memory to achieve 75% accuracy in sequential recall of 5 images.

#### Long-term Goals (Within 6 weeks):
Comprehensively improve motor and cognitive functions. Motor aspects: Enhance upper limb strength and gait pattern, increase walking speed to 0.4m/s, achieve independent indoor ambulation under supervision, and improve cardiopulmonary endurance to maintain Borg Dyspnea Scale ≤4 post-6-minute walk test. Functional aspects: Increase active participation of the left upper limb to enable independent placement of the left hand on the contralateral shoulder while seated, facilitating self-care activities (e.g., dressing, washing). Cognitive aspects: Further enhance memory and attention to manage daily routines using compensatory tools (memos, sticky notes).

### 2. Therapeutic Interventions

#### (I) Motor Dysfunction Management
1.  **ROM Training & Facilitation Techniques:** Manual therapy including joint mobilization (e.g., joint compression) and Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) for proprioceptive input to restore active movement.  
    *Frequency: 2x/day, 10-20 min/session.*  
2.  **Tone Modulation & Stretching:** Sustained stretching for hypertonic muscle groups.  
    *Parameters: 15 sec – 2 min hold, 5 reps/set, 2x/day.*  
3.  **Strength & Endurance Training:** Progressive resistance training using anti-gravity exercises, manual resistance, dumbbells, sandbags, and elastic bands. Endurance training via MOTOMED upper/lower limb ergometers and pneumatic pedals with low-intensity, high-repetition protocol.  
    *Frequency: 2x/day, 10-20 min/session.*  
4.  **Balance Training:**  
    - *Sitting:* Use seated balance trainer.  
        *Frequency: 1x/day, 20 min/session.*  
    - *Standing:* Perturbation training on flat/foam surfaces, dual-task activities (e.g., ball tossing), elliptical trainer, and Balance Master® to enhance hip/ankle strategies and stability limits.  
        *Frequency: 1x/day, 10 min/session.*  
5.  **Gait Correction:** Visual feedback via mirror to correct circumduction gait; promote hip/knee flexion during swing phase. Anterior tibialis and gastrocnemius activation via toe-dorsiflexion and towel-scrunching. Task progression (e.g., obstacle negotiation, ball-tossing while walking) to build motor memory, increase velocity, and reduce assistive device dependence.  
    *Frequency: 1x/day, 10-20 min/session.*  
6.  **Cardiopulmonary Endurance Training:** Cycle ergometer at 5-10W, ≈60 RPM.  
    *Frequency: 5x/week, 20 min/session.*  

#### (II) Cognitive Dysfunction Management
1.  **Capacity-Based Training:**  
    - *Attention/Immediate Memory:* Recall of 4-6 images.  
    - *Logical Reasoning:* Sequential ordering of scenario-based pictures (e.g., shopping, medical consultation).  
        *Frequency: 2x/day, 20 min/session.*  
2.  **Functional Training:**  
    - *Compensatory Strategies:* Use smartphone memos/alarms for task reminders.  
    - *ADL Simulation:* Medication adherence, route-finding to therapy rooms.  
    - *Role-Play:* Occupation-specific scenarios (fruit shop inventory/sales).  
        *Frequency: 2x/day, 20 min/session.*  
3.  **Computer-Assisted Cognitive Training:** Software-based attention/memory/reasoning exercises.  
    *Frequency: 2x/day, 10 min/session.*  

#### (III) Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training
1.  **Upper Limb Functional Training:**  
    - Elbow strap for joint stabilization during forward-reaching (cup placement).  
    - Gravity-eliminated elbow flexion/extension on high plinth; Rood scraping technique as needed.  
        *Frequency: 6x/week, 20 min/session.*  
2.  **ADL Practice:** Enhance multi-joint coordination for dressing/washing using adaptive equipment/techniques.  
    *Frequency: 6x/week, 20 min/session.*  
3.  **Instrument-Assisted Training:** Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) for muscle re-education.  
    *Frequency: 6x/week, 2x/day, 20 min/session.*  

#### (IV) Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Interventions
1.  **Herbal Therapy:** For "Qi deficiency with Yin depletion" (正气亏虚、阴液不足): *Radix Astragali* (生黄芪), *Radix Glehniae* (北沙参), *Radix Asparagi* (天冬), *Radix Ophiopogonis* (麦冬) to tonify Qi, nourish Yin, and alleviate post-radiation xerostomia.  
2.  **Acupuncture:**  
    - ST36 (足三里), SP6 (三阴交), SP10 (血海) to fortify Qi and strengthen spleen/kidney.  
    - LI15 (肩髃), TE14 (肩髎), LI14 (臂臑), GB39 (悬钟) to dredge channels and improve limb function.  

#### (V) Ward-Based Rehabilitation & Nursing
1.  **General Care & Education:** Monitor vital signs, provide dietary guidance, psychological support, and sleep hygiene. Educate patient/family on impaired limb care, activity-rest balance.  
2.  **Complication Prevention/Management:**  
    - *Nausea/Vomiting:* Lateral decubitus positioning, oral suctioning, antiemetics per physician order.  
    - *Seizures:* Continuous observation, airway protection, soft mouth guard, bed rails, joint protection (no restraint), detailed episode documentation.  
    - *Safety Precautions:* Monitor fatigue levels during training to prevent seizure provocation.
