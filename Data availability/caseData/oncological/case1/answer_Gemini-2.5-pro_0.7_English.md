# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4 weeks):

1.  **Mobility & Transfers**: Improve sit-to-stand transfer from minimal assistance to supervision. Increase indoor ambulation distance with a quad cane to 150m under supervision.
2.  **Balance**: Improve Berg Balance Scale (BBS) score from 21 to 28, demonstrating improved static and dynamic standing balance within parallel bars.
3.  **Upper Limb Function**: Patient will be able to use the left upper limb as a functional assist (e.g., stabilizing paper with the forearm/hand while writing with the right hand). Achieve passive full range of motion in all left upper limb joints.
4.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL)**: Achieve independence in upper body dressing with task setup and supervision. Improve Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score from 71 to 80.
5.  **Cognitive Function**: Patient will be able to consistently follow 2-step verbal commands during therapy sessions. Patient will be able to recall the daily therapy schedule using a provided visual aid.
6.  **Pain & Spasticity Management**: Patient and family will demonstrate proficiency in proper positioning techniques for the left limbs and in performing passive range of motion exercises to manage spasticity and prevent contractures.

### Long-term goals (upon discharge):

1.  **Mobility & Gait**: Achieve independent ambulation indoors with a single-point cane. Achieve community ambulation on level surfaces for 200m with a single-point cane and supervision. Improve gait speed to >0.4 m/s to enhance safety.
2.  **Balance & Safety**: Achieve a Berg Balance Scale (BBS) score >40 to significantly reduce fall risk. Demonstrate the ability to recover from minor balance perturbations.
3.  **Upper Limb Function**: Utilize the left upper limb as an active assist in bimanual tasks (e.g., carrying a light object, assisting with opening a jar).
4.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL)**: Achieve independence or require only supervision for all basic ADLs (Modified Barthel Index >90), including bathing and dressing.
5.  **Cognitive Function**: Patient will be able to independently use compensatory strategies (e.g., notebook, calendar) to manage daily routines and appointments, improving safety and participation in instrumental ADLs.
6.  **Social Reintegration**: Return home with family support, with the ability to participate in basic family and social activities.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy (PT)

1.  **Neurophysiological Approaches**: Employ Neurodevelopmental Treatment (NDT) and Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) techniques to inhibit abnormal tone and compensatory patterns, while facilitating normal movement sequences, particularly in the trunk, pelvis, and left limbs.
2.  **Strength Training**:
    *   **Lower Limb**: Focus on strengthening proximal muscles (iliopsoas, gluteus medius, quadriceps) through closed-chain and open-chain exercises. Initiate targeted strengthening for distal muscles (tibialis anterior, triceps surae) using gravity-eliminated exercises, progressing to active-assisted and active exercises.
    *   **Core Stability**: Implement exercises to improve trunk control, which is fundamental for balance and limb movement.
3.  **Spasticity and Contracture Management**:
    *   Perform daily passive and active-assisted range of motion (ROM) exercises for all left-sided joints.
    *   Incorporate prolonged, gentle stretching for spastic muscle groups, particularly ankle plantarflexors and wrist/finger flexors.
    *   Educate on and implement a regular positioning schedule in bed and in the wheelchair to reduce tone and prevent contractures.
4.  **Balance Training**:
    *   **Static Balance**: Progress from sitting to standing balance training, initially with support (parallel bars) and progressing to less support.
    *   **Dynamic Balance**: Incorporate weight shifting, reaching beyond arm's length in sitting and standing, and controlled trunk rotation exercises.
    *   **Sensory Integration**: Introduce activities on varied surfaces (e.g., foam pads) and with reduced visual input to challenge and retrain the vestibular and proprioceptive systems.
5.  **Gait Training**:
    *   **Task-Specific Training**: Utilize a treadmill with partial body weight support to facilitate a more symmetrical gait pattern and improve endurance. Focus on correcting deviations: cue for heel strike, control knee hyperextension, and reduce hip abduction.
    *   **Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES)**: Apply FES to the left tibialis anterior muscle during gait training to address foot drop and improve foot clearance.
    *   **Endurance Training**: Gradually increase the duration and intensity of walking sessions, monitoring cardiopulmonary response via the Borg scale and vital signs.

### Occupational Therapy (OT)

1.  **Upper Limb Motor and Sensory Re-education**:
    *   **Task-Oriented Training**: Engage the patient in repetitive, goal-directed tasks to promote motor learning (e.g., placing cones, wiping a table).
    *   **Mirror Therapy**: Use a mirror box to create the visual illusion of normal movement in the affected left hand, promoting cortical reorganization.
    *   **Sensory Retraining**: Provide graded sensory stimulation to the left upper limb (different textures, temperatures, pressures) to improve sensory awareness.
    *   **Splinting**: Fabricate a resting hand splint for the left hand to be worn during periods of rest to maintain soft tissue length and prevent contractures.
2.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training**:
    *   **Dressing**: Address the patient's primary goal by breaking down the task of dressing. Begin with upper body dressing while seated. Teach adaptive strategies (e.g., dressing the affected side first) and introduce adaptive equipment (e.g., button hook) as needed.
    *   **Transfer Training**: Practice safe and efficient transfers between surfaces (bed, wheelchair, toilet, chair) to improve independence and reduce caregiver burden.
    *   **Bathing/Grooming**: Simulate and practice these activities using a tub bench/shower chair and long-handled adaptive equipment.
3.  **Cognitive Rehabilitation (Integrated into Function)**:
    *   **Strategy Training**: Embed cognitive interventions within functional tasks. For example, create a simple, pictorial checklist for the sequence of dressing.
    *   **Attention & Executive Function**: Structure therapy sessions with clear, simple instructions. Practice planning and problem-solving within the context of ADLs (e.g., "What do you need to do first to brush your teeth?").
    *   **Environmental Modification**: Advise on simplifying the patient's immediate environment to reduce cognitive load and enhance safety.

### Cognitive Rehabilitation

1.  **Orientation**: Begin each session with orientation questions (person, place, time) and use a large whiteboard/calendar in the patient's room as a constant visual aid.
2.  **Attention Training**: Use structured, graded computer-based and paper-and-pencil tasks to improve sustained and selective attention.
3.  **Memory Strategy Training**: Introduce and drill the use of external memory aids, such as a simple notebook for writing down key information and the daily schedule. Practice spaced retrieval techniques for important information.
4.  **Executive Function Training**: Engage in simple planning and sequencing tasks (e.g., organizing steps for a simple activity).

### Patient and Family Education

1.  **Condition and Prognosis**: Provide clear education about the functional consequences of the brain tumor and its treatment, setting realistic expectations for recovery.
2.  **Safety**: Emphasize fall prevention strategies for the hospital and home environment. Provide training on skin inspection for the left side due to sensory loss.
3.  **Home Program**: Train the family to confidently and correctly assist with the home exercise program, including ROM exercises, positioning, and transfer assistance.
4.  **Communication Strategies**: Counsel the family on effective communication techniques given the patient's cognitive deficits: use simple, direct sentences; allow ample time for processing and response; minimize distractions during conversation.
