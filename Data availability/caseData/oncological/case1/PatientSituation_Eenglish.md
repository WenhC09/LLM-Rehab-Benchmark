# Clinical Summary

## I. Basic Information and Medical History

*   **Patient Information**: Male, 40 years old, right-handed.
*   **Chief Complaint**: Left limb weakness, balance impairment, and gait dysfunction 5 months post-operative for brain glioma.
*   **Present Illness**: The patient experienced sudden fall with loss of consciousness and unresponsiveness 6 months ago. Cranial MRI suggested "possible tumor in the right frontal lobe and basal ganglia region". Five months ago, the patient underwent "craniotomy for tumor resection" under general anesthesia. Postoperative pathology diagnosed "Diffuse glioma, astrocytoma phenotype, WHO Grade 2". Postoperative management included dehydration for intracranial pressure reduction, infection prophylaxis, and seizure prophylaxis. Chemoradiotherapy was initiated 4 months ago (tumor bed and surgical field proton therapy 54Gy/27F; tumor high-risk region and peritumoral edema proton therapy 48.6Gy/27F; concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy). Currently admitted for further improvement of left limb weakness, pain, balance impairment, and gait dysfunction.
*   **Past Medical History**: Previously healthy, no significant history.
*   **Patient and Family Goals**: The patient requires a cane for ambulation with limited walking distance. Family reports decline in memory, calculation ability, and cognitive function compared to pre-operation, unable to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) independently. The patient aims to improve left limb motor function through rehabilitation to achieve self-care and community reintegration; simultaneously alleviate pain, improve sleep, and enhance quality of life.

## II. Physical Examination (On Admission)

*   **Vital Signs**: Temperature 36.5°C, Pulse 72 bpm, Respiration 19 bpm, Blood Pressure 126/87 mmHg.
*   **General Condition**: Wheelchair-bound upon admission. An approximately 10cm long healed surgical scar visible on the cranial vertex.
*   **Neurological Examination**:
    *   **Consciousness and Cognition**: Alert, responsive with coherent speech, but overall reaction sluggish. Gross testing reveals impaired memory, orientation, and calculation.
    *   **Cranial Nerves**: Flattened left nasolabial fold, tongue protrusion uncooperative, bilateral gag reflex normal.
    *   **Motor System**: Decreased muscle strength in left upper and lower limbs, normal on the right. Increased muscle tone in left limbs, normal on the right.
    *   **Active Range of Motion (AROM)**: Left hip flexion 0°~105°, left knee flexion 0°~130°, left ankle dorsiflexion 10°, plantarflexion 30°. AROM in left upper limb joints could not be assessed due to non-cooperation. Normal AROM in right limbs.
    *   **Balance Function**: Sitting: maintains dynamic balance; Standing: maintains automatic balance.
    *   **Sensory System**: Mild decrease in both superficial and deep sensation on the left.

## III. Diagnosis

1.  Glioma (WHO Grade II)
2.  Postoperative Chemotherapy for Malignancy
3.  Left Limb Motor Dysfunction
4.  Left Limb Sensory Dysfunction
5.  Balance Impairment
6.  Gait Dysfunction
7.  Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Impairment

# Pre-Rehabilitation Quantitative Assessments

## I. Motor Function Assessment

*   **Muscle Strength Assessment (Manual Muscle Testing)**:
    *   **Upper Limb**: Shoulder Flexion II, Shoulder Abduction II, Biceps Brachii II, Triceps Brachii II, Wrist Extensors II, Finger Muscles predominantly I.
    *   **Lower Limb**: Iliopsoas IV, Gluteus Medius IV, Hamstrings III, Quadriceps IV, Tibialis Anterior II, Triceps Surae I.
*   **Muscle Tone Assessment (Modified Ashworth Scale)**: Increased muscle tone in all left limbs.
*   **Range of Motion (ROM)**: Decreased Active ROM in all left limb joints.
*   **Balance Assessment (Berg Balance Scale)**:
    *   Score: **21/56**, indicating balance impairment with fall risk.
    *   Level: Sitting Balance Level II, Standing Balance Level I.
*   **Gait and Functional Mobility Assessment**:
    *   **Functional Mobility**: Independent in bed mobility (scooting, rolling, sitting up); transfers bed-to-chair with supervision; sit-to-stand transfers with minimal assistance (1 person).
    *   **Walking Capacity**: Ambulates indoors for 100m using a quad cane under supervision.
    *   **Walking Speed**: Approximately **0.2 m/s**.
    *   **Cardiopulmonary Endurance**: Borg Dyspnea Scale score **4/10** after 100m indoor walk.
    *   **Gait Analysis**: Features include left calf muscle spasticity, left ankle inversion; compensatory gait patterns: foot drop, knee hyperextension, and excessive hip abduction for foot clearance.

## II. Sensory Function Assessment

*   Pinprick sensation, light touch, position sense, and kinesthesia are decreased to varying degrees in the left upper limb compared to the right.

## III. Cognitive Function Assessment

*   **Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)**:
    *   Score: **11+1 / 30** (1 point added for primary school education level).
    *   Result indicates cognitive impairment, with deficits in executive function, visuospatial abilities, attention, immediate recall, short-term memory, long-term memory, temporal/spatial orientation, and logical thinking.
    *   During conversation, patient exhibits decreased attention, disorganized thinking (e.g., unable to correctly name the province of the hospital), and occasional irrelevant responses.

## IV. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assessment

*   **Frenchay Arm Test (FTHUE-H)**:
    *   Level: **III**.
    *   Performance: Small range active movement present in shoulder/elbow, but limited ability to perform assisted tasks like opening bottles or wringing towels.
*   **Modified Barthel Index (MBI)**:
    *   Score: **71/100**, indicating mild dependence in ADLs.
    *   Performance: Requires minimal assistance for dressing and level walking; moderate assistance for bathing; maximal assistance for bed-chair transfers; unable to climb stairs.
*   **Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (Lawton-IADL)**:
    *   Unable to assess shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, mode of transportation, responsibility for own medications, or ability to handle finances due to inpatient rehabilitation status. Work communication limited to mobile phone contact with colleagues.
*   **Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)**:
    *   Through needs assessment with patient and family, **dressing** was identified as the most important and needed occupational activity for current improvement.
