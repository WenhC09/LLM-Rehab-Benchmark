# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Improve left limb muscle strength to at least Grade III in upper and lower limbs within 4-6 weeks.
- Enhance balance and reduce fall risk, aiming for a Berg Balance Scale score of at least 30/56 within 6 weeks.
- Increase walking distance to 200m with a quad cane under supervision within 4 weeks.
- Improve cognitive function as evidenced by a 2-point increase in MoCA score within 6 weeks.
- Achieve independence in dressing with minimal assistance within 6 weeks.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve independent ambulation for at least 500m with a quad cane within 3 months.
- Attain Grade IV muscle strength in left upper and lower limbs within 3 months.
- Improve overall cognitive function to support independent living and daily activities, aiming for a MoCA score of at least 20/30 within 3 months.
- Achieve independence in all activities of daily living (ADL) within 3 months.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### Physical Rehabilitation:
- **Strength Training**: 
  - Implement progressive resistance exercises focusing on left upper and lower limb muscle groups, using weights and resistance bands.
  - Target specific muscle groups with manual resistance and functional tasks to enhance strength.

- **Balance Training**: 
  - Utilize balance exercises such as single-leg stands, tandem walking, and dynamic balance activities (e.g., reaching tasks) to improve stability.
  - Incorporate the use of balance boards and stability balls to challenge balance further.

- **Gait Training**: 
  - Conduct gait training sessions focusing on proper mechanics, using a quad cane for support.
  - Implement treadmill training with body-weight support to improve gait speed and endurance.

- **Range of Motion Exercises**: 
  - Perform passive and active-assisted range of motion exercises for the left upper and lower limbs to prevent contractures and improve flexibility.

### Occupational Therapy:
- **ADL Training**: 
  - Engage the patient in dressing activities using adaptive techniques and tools to promote independence.
  - Practice other essential ADLs (e.g., grooming, bathing) with a focus on task simplification and energy conservation.

- **Cognitive Rehabilitation**: 
  - Implement cognitive exercises targeting memory, attention, and executive function through structured activities and games.
  - Use memory aids and strategies to enhance daily functioning and orientation.

### Pain Management:
- **Therapeutic Modalities**: 
  - Apply modalities such as heat, cold, or electrical stimulation to manage pain and muscle tone in the left limb.
  
- **Medication Review**: 
  - Collaborate with the medical team to assess and optimize pain management strategies, ensuring the patient is comfortable during rehabilitation.

### Family Education and Involvement:
- Educate the family on the rehabilitation process, encouraging their involvement in therapy sessions to support the patient’s progress.
- Provide training on how to assist the patient safely during mobility and ADL tasks at home.

### Monitoring and Evaluation:
- Regularly assess progress towards rehabilitation goals through standardized assessments (e.g., MBI, MoCA, Berg Balance Scale) every 2-4 weeks.
- Adjust the treatment plan based on the patient’s progress and feedback from the patient and family.
