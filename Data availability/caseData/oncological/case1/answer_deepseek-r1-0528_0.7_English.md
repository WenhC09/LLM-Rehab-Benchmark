# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (2-4 weeks):
- Increase left upper limb proximal muscle strength to ≥Grade III (against gravity) to enable basic ADL participation
- Improve left ankle dorsiflexion strength to ≥Grade III for foot clearance during gait
- Reduce Berg Balance Scale fall risk category through static standing balance training
- Achieve modified independence in upper body dressing using adaptive techniques
- Increase indoor walking distance to 150m with quad cane at 0.3 m/s (Borg ≤3)
- Implement cognitive compensation strategies for memory/orientation deficits

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve functional left hand assist (FAT Level IV) for bimanual ADL tasks
- Attain supervised community ambulation (300m at 0.5 m/s) without assistive device
- Reach modified Barthel Index ≥90 (minimal assistance required for bathing only)
- Normalize gait pattern with elimination of compensatory hip abduction
- Enable return to home-based work activities using cognitive aids
- Establish sustainable pain management regimen for sleep quality improvement

## 2. Treatment Methods
### Motor Function Rehabilitation
- **Strength Training**: 
  - Progressive resistance exercise (PRE) for left limbs: Shoulder abduction/adduction in gravity-eliminated position → anti-gravity resistance
  - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) for tibialis anterior during gait training
  - Closed-chain exercises: Partial squats (bilateral→unilateral) targeting quadriceps/gluteals
- **Tone Management**:
  - Inhibitory casting for left ankle plantarflexors (serial casting protocol)
  - Daily proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching for spastic muscle groups
  - Thermal modalities (cryotherapy) before stretching interventions
- **Gait/Balance Training**:
  - Body-weight supported treadmill training (BWS-TT) with 30% support → progressive weaning
  - Perturbation-based balance training on unstable surfaces (foam → rocker board)
  - Overground gait training with real-time spatiotemporal feedback (wearable sensors)

### Sensory Rehabilitation
- Sensory re-education protocol: Texture discrimination → object recognition → stereognosis training
- Mirror therapy for left limb sensory neglect
- Contrast bath therapy for sensory modulation

### Cognitive Rehabilitation
- Attention Process Training (APT) program: Focused → sustained → divided attention progression
- Errorless learning approach for ADL retraining (dressing sequence)
- External memory aid implementation (smartphone reminders for medication/meals)
- Dual-task training: Motor-cognitive integration (walking while counting)

### ADL-Specific Interventions
- Task-embedded motor learning: Dressing practice with adaptive equipment (button hook)
- Energy conservation techniques during bathing/transfers
- Home simulation activities: Kitchen task practice (safe cup retrieval)

### Pain/Sleep Management
- Graded motor imagery program for neuropathic pain
- Sleep positioning education with pressure-relieving strategies
- Relaxation training: Diaphragmatic breathing → progressive muscle relaxation

### Adjunctive Therapies
- Aquatic therapy for resistance training with buoyancy support
- Constraint-induced movement therapy (modified) for left upper extremity
- Family/caregiver education: Safe transfer techniques, cognitive cueing strategies

### Monitoring Parameters
- Biweekly reassessment: MMT, Berg Balance, 10MWT, MoCA
- Pain/sleep diary tracking with weekly review
- Chemotherapy-related fatigue monitoring (FACIT-F scale)
