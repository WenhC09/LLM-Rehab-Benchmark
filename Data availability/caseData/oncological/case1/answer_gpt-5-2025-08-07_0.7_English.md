# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4–6 weeks)
1. Increase left upper limb muscle strength by at least 1 grade in key proximal muscle groups (shoulder flexors/abductors, elbow flexors/extensors).
2. Improve left ankle dorsiflexion control to reduce foot drop during walking.
3. Increase Berg Balance Scale score from 21 to ≥30 to reduce fall risk.
4. Improve indoor walking speed from 0.2 m/s to ≥0.3 m/s with quad cane under supervision, and walking distance to ≥200m with reduced fatigue (Borg ≤3).
5. Enhance independence in basic ADLs — raise Modified Barthel Index from 71 to ≥80, with focus on dressing.
6. Reduce muscle spasticity in left calf to improve gait pattern.
7. Initiate targeted cognitive rehabilitation to improve attention and orientation, aiming for ≥3-point increase in MoCA score.
8. Alleviate pain in left limbs to ≤2/10 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (if applicable).

### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
1. Achieve left lower limb muscle strength of ≥Grade IV in all major muscle groups; improve left upper limb distal control to Grade III or above for functional grasp.
2. Walk ≥500m indoors and outdoors with single-point cane or no aid, walking speed ≥0.6 m/s, safe negotiation of stairs with supervision.
3. Berg Balance Scale ≥45, enabling safe community ambulation with low fall risk.
4. Modified Barthel Index ≥90 — independent in dressing, bathing, transfers, and level walking; minimal assistance for complex IADLs.
5. MoCA score improvement by ≥5 points, with better executive function, memory, and problem-solving for daily life.
6. Improve occupational performance in dressing to patient-specified satisfactory level on COPM.
7. Maintain muscle tone within functional range (Modified Ashworth ≤1+ in affected limbs).
8. Improve quality of life with better sleep, reduced fatigue, and participation in meaningful social activities.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Physical Therapy (PT)
1. **Neurofacilitation Techniques**
   * Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) patterns for affected limbs.
   * Bobath concept to inhibit abnormal tone and facilitate normal movement patterns.
2. **Muscle Strengthening**
   * Active-assisted and active-resisted exercises for left upper and lower limbs.
   * Functional electrical stimulation (FES) for left tibialis anterior and wrist/finger extensors to reduce foot drop and improve hand opening.
3. **Spasticity Management**
   * Slow, prolonged stretching of gastrocnemius–soleus, hamstrings, and wrist/finger flexors.
   * Positioning to prevent contractures (night splints for ankle in neutral).
4. **Balance and Coordination Training**
   * Static and dynamic balance exercises in sitting and standing.
   * Weight-shifting, stepping, and functional reach tasks.
   * Use of balance pads and parallel bars for safety.
5. **Gait Training**
   * Step training in parallel bars with focus on heel strike, knee control, and foot clearance.
   * Ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) trial for foot drop management.
   * Progression from quad cane to single-point cane as balance improves.
   * Treadmill walking with body weight support if indicated.
6. **Endurance Training**
   * Graded walking distance, stationary cycling, or NuStep machine with monitoring (target Borg ≤3).

### B. Occupational Therapy (OT)
1. **ADL Training**
   * Task-specific training for dressing: practice donning/doffing clothes with adaptive techniques and aids.
   * Upper limb functional tasks: reaching, grasping, object manipulation with affected hand.
2. **Upper Limb Function Recovery**
   * Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) modified for tolerance.
   * Bilateral arm training to promote interhemispheric facilitation.
3. **Fine Motor Skills**
   * Pegboards, putty exercises, and manipulation of daily objects.
4. **Environmental Modifications**
   * Education on safe home setup to prevent falls.
   * Adaptive devices for dressing and bathing.

### C. Cognitive Rehabilitation
1. **Attention and Memory Training**
   * Computer-based and paper–pencil tasks for sustained attention, divided attention, and working memory.
2. **Executive Function Training**
   * Problem-solving tasks, sequencing activities, and planning daily routines.
3. **Orientation Training**
   * Daily orientation boards, structured conversation regarding date, place, and situation.
4. **Family Education**
   * Strategies to support communication, cognitive cueing, and structured environment.

### D. Speech and Language Therapy (if indicated)
* For any subtle communication deficits or cognitive-communication issues observed during rehab.

### E. Pain Management
* Local modalities: heat or cold packs, gentle massage, TENS for neuropathic discomfort.
* Monitor and adjust according to pain scores.

### F. Psychological Support
* Counseling to address emotional adjustment, anxiety, and depression related to disability.
* Sleep hygiene education and relaxation techniques.

### G. Patient and Family Education
* Home exercise program instruction.
* Fall prevention strategies.
* Energy conservation techniques during daily tasks.

### H. Multidisciplinary Coordination
* Regular interdisciplinary team meetings to review progress and adjust goals.
* Liaison with oncology team to coordinate around chemoradiotherapy schedule and monitor for treatment-related fatigue or myelosuppression.
