# 1. Rehabilitation Goals

* **Short-term Goals (During Hospital Chemotherapy):**
  * Improve muscle strength and active range of motion (AROM) of joints
  * Reduce fatigue
  * Enhance independent sputum expectoration
  * Increase activity endurance

* **Long-term Goals (Post-radiotherapy & After Discharge):**
  * Restore independent ambulation and mobility
  * Improve activities of daily living (ADL) independence
  * Enhance overall health status
  * Ultimately improve quality of life (QoL)

# 2. Therapeutic Interventions

* **Muscle Strength Training:**
  * **Early Rehabilitation Phase:**
    * Therapist-assisted isometric contraction exercises (e.g., bilateral upper limb elevation hold for 30 seconds). Frequency: 10 sets/session, twice daily. Aims to enhance proprioceptive input, muscle strength, and motor control stability.
  * **Post-radiotherapy Phase:**
    * Introduce static resistance training using 2-kg weighted sandbags with straps (e.g., seated bilateral upper limb elevation hold for 1 minute, supine alternating leg raises) for progressive strengthening.
  * **Post-discharge Phase:**
    * Instruct on weight-bearing exercises using barbells/dumbbells (e.g., squats, leg lifts). Sport-specialized therapists design targeted exercises (e.g., seated leg extensions, sit-to-stand transitions, kicking drills) to strengthen weak quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles, promoting myofiber growth and motor control.

* **Joint Range of Motion (ROM) Training:**
  * For limited passive ROM in lower limbs: Combine therapist-assisted passive movements with self-stretching, followed by orthotic positioning to gradually improve ROM.
  * For reduced active upper limb ROM: Implement active ROM exercises using rollers, elastic bands, and dynamic orthoses.

* **Fatigue Management:**
  * **Early Phase (Severe Fatigue):** Therapist-administered passive massage and fascial relaxation techniques to alleviate muscle tension and mental anxiety.
  * **Mid Phase (Reduced Fatigue):** Instruct on self-myofascial release using foam rollers and massage balls.
  * **Late Phase (Post-discharge/Treatment Intervals):** Occupational therapist-guided energy conservation strategies (e.g., music therapy, walking, seated rest post-exercise) and activity simplification. Collaborate with family to establish structured rest-sleep schedules.

* **Nutrition and Energy Management:**
  * Nutritionist-prescribed protein/vitamin/mineral-enriched formula supplements.
  * Individualized dietary plans via regular nutritionist consultations to boost energy levels, promote myofiber synthesis, and reduce fat intake.

* **Psychological Therapy and Support:**
  * Psychologist-provided psychological support, stress management, and counseling.
  * Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) implemented for depressive phase: 3x/week patient sessions + 2x/week family sessions.
  * Social worker-facilitated lymphoma support group participation for peer encouragement.
  * Post-discharge: Regular outpatient psychological counseling and structured emotional regulation training to mitigate anxiety/depression in patients and caregivers.

* **Bedside Standing Training with Assistance:**
  * **Initial Stage:** Pre-standing bed exercises (stretching, fist clenching, toe flexion/extension). Therapist-family-assisted sitting-to-standing transitions with 10-minute standing holds (2x/day) to prevent immobilization complications.
  * **Progression Stage:** Independent standing using grab bars and standing frames as upper limb strength/trunk stability improves.
  * **Advanced Stage:** Incremental balance training (e.g., single-leg stance, weight shifting, reaching tasks, step initiation).

* **Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program:**
  * **Bedridden Phase:** Diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing exercises. Therapist-administered manual techniques to relax shoulder/back muscles and improve diaphragmatic mobility.
  * **Sputum Clearance:** Postural drainage based on auscultation findings + vibratory sputum clearance techniques.
  * **Mid-Late Chemotherapy Phase:** Post-resolution of pulmonary infection: Daily inspiratory muscle training using smart breathing trainers (2x/day) + arm ergometer aerobic exercise (1x/day) to improve vital capacity and endurance.

* **Occupational Therapy (OT):**
  * **Early Phase:** Interest-based activities (card flipping, spiky ball squeezing, rubber band snapping) to enhance peripheral sensory input and fine motor control.
  * **Sitting Independence Phase:** ADL simulation training (dressing, feeding, grooming) with compensatory strategies/modifications for deficits.
  * **Late Hospitalization Phase:** Neuroplasticity-focused activities (elastic table tennis, suspended soccer game, clay cutting, ball catching/throwing, board games) to improve upper limb fine motor control, perception, and engagement.
