# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
1. Improve muscle strength in upper and lower limbs, aiming for at least a 1-point increase in muscle strength grades within 4 weeks.
2. Enhance activities of daily living (ADL) independence, targeting a Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score increase to 40 within 4 weeks.
3. Manage fatigue levels, aiming for a reduction in the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) score by 20 points within 4 weeks.
4. Stabilize vital signs and improve oxygen saturation (SpOâ‚‚) to above 90% during rest and minimal activity.

### Long-term goals:
1. Achieve significant improvement in muscle strength, aiming for a minimum of grade III in all extremities within 3 months.
2. Attain a Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score of 60, indicating moderate dependence, within 3 months.
3. Improve psychological well-being, targeting a reduction in PHQ-9 score to below 10, indicating minimal depression within 3 months.
4. Facilitate a gradual return to work as a physical education teacher, with a focus on adaptive strategies and support within 6 months.

## Treatment Methods:
1. **Physical Therapy:**
   - Initiate passive range of motion (ROM) exercises for all extremities to prevent contractures and improve joint mobility.
   - Progress to active-assisted and active exercises as tolerated, focusing on strengthening exercises for upper and lower limbs.
   - Incorporate functional training to improve ADL performance, including sit-to-stand transfers and basic mobility tasks.

2. **Occupational Therapy:**
   - Implement adaptive techniques and assistive devices to facilitate participation in daily activities.
   - Focus on fine motor skills rehabilitation through targeted exercises to improve grip and pinch strength.

3. **Respiratory Therapy:**
   - Conduct breathing exercises to enhance lung capacity and oxygenation, including incentive spirometry and diaphragmatic breathing.
   - Monitor and manage dyspnea through positioning and pacing strategies during activities.

4. **Nutritional Support:**
   - Collaborate with a dietitian to develop a high-protein, calorie-dense diet to address hypoalbuminemia and promote weight gain.
   - Consider supplementation as needed to support recovery and improve overall nutritional status.

5. **Psychosocial Support:**
   - Provide counseling and support to address anxiety and depression, utilizing cognitive-behavioral strategies.
   - Encourage participation in support groups and family involvement to enhance emotional well-being and motivation.

6. **Monitoring and Evaluation:**
   - Regularly assess progress through functional scales (MBI, KPS, BFI) and adjust the rehabilitation plan as necessary.
   - Schedule multidisciplinary team meetings to review patient progress and adapt treatment strategies accordingly.
