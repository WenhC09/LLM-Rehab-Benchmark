# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4-8 weeks):
- Improve muscle strength in upper and lower limbs by at least one grade (e.g., left upper limb from II to III, bilateral lower limbs from III to IV).
- Enhance exercise tolerance to sustain low-intensity activities (e.g., sitting or standing) for 10-15 minutes without dyspnea or SpO₂ dropping below 90%.
- Increase Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score to 40-50, enabling partial independence in basic activities of daily living (ADL) such as feeding and grooming.
- Reduce Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) score by 20-30 points to alleviate extreme fatigue.
- Address psychological distress, reducing Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score to mild depression range.
- Optimize nutritional status to increase body weight by 1-2 kg and improve serum albumin levels.

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve functional independence in most ADLs (MBI score ≥75).
- Restore sufficient muscle strength and coordination to ambulate with assistive devices (e.g., walker) for short distances (20-30 meters).
- Improve Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) to ≥50, enabling self-care with minimal assistance.
- Enhance grip and pinch strength to support functional tasks (e.g., writing, dressing).
- Promote psychological resilience, reducing anxiety about disease recurrence and improving social engagement through peer support group participation.
- Maintain stable cardiopulmonary function to support light physical activities without significant dyspnea or desaturation.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Physical Therapy
- **Passive Range of Motion (ROM) Exercises**: 
  - Daily sessions (15-20 min) focusing on bilateral upper and lower limbs to prevent contractures and maintain joint mobility, particularly in hands and lower limbs with noted stiffness and limited ROM.
  - Gentle stretching for hand joints to improve flexibility and reduce stiffness.
- **Progressive Resistive Exercises**:
  - Low-intensity isometric exercises for upper and lower limbs (e.g., quadriceps setting, shoulder shrugs) starting with 5-10 repetitions, 2 sets daily, adjusted based on tolerance.
  - Gradual introduction of light resistance bands (once muscle strength improves to grade III-IV) to target proximal and distal muscle groups.
- **Bedside Functional Training**:
  - Sitting balance exercises (e.g., sitting unsupported on bed edge) for 5-10 min, 2-3 times daily, to enhance core stability and endurance.
  - Transfer training (bed to chair) with assistance, progressing to minimal assistance as strength improves.
- **Positioning and Postural Support**:
  - Use of pillows and splints to maintain neutral limb positioning and prevent deformities.
  - Frequent repositioning (every 2 hours) to reduce pressure ulcer risk given prolonged bedrest.

### B. Occupational Therapy
- **Fine Motor Training**:
  - Hand therapy with soft grip balls and finger extension exercises to improve grip (left: 10 kg, right: 29 kg) and pinch strength (left: 0.8 kg, right: 3 kg).
  - Task-specific activities (e.g., buttoning, holding utensils) to enhance ADL performance, starting with adaptive equipment if needed.
- **Sensory Retraining**:
  - Tactile stimulation (e.g., textured objects, brushing) to address bilateral hand numbness and hypesthesia, 10-15 min daily.
- **Energy Conservation Techniques**:
  - Education on pacing activities to manage extreme fatigue (BFI: 82), prioritizing essential tasks and incorporating rest breaks.

### C. Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation
- **Breathing Exercises**:
  - Diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing (5-10 min, 3 times daily) to improve respiratory efficiency and manage dyspnea.
  - Incentive spirometry (10 breaths per session, 3-4 times daily) to enhance lung expansion and prevent atelectasis.
- **Graded Activity Program**:
  - Initiate with seated activities (e.g., arm raises, ankle pumps) for 5-10 min, monitoring SpO₂ and heart rate to ensure stability (SpO₂ ≥90%, HR <100 bpm).
  - Progress to standing exercises (e.g., partial weight-bearing with support) as tolerated, aiming for 10-15 min sessions.

### D. Nutritional Support
- **Dietary Counseling**:
  - Collaborate with a dietitian to design a high-protein, high-calorie diet to address hypoalbuminemia (low serum albumin) and weight loss (current weight: 45 kg).
  - Small, frequent meals (5-6 daily) with oral nutritional supplements to support muscle recovery and weight gain (target: 1-2 kg increase in 4-8 weeks).
- **Monitoring**:
  - Weekly assessment of weight, serum albumin, and prealbumin levels to evaluate nutritional progress.

### E. Psychological and Social Support
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**:
  - Weekly sessions with a psychologist to address moderate depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety about disease recurrence, focusing on coping strategies and building self-confidence.
- **Peer Support Engagement**:
  - Encourage continued participation in the lymphoma peer support group (virtual or in-person, depending on mobility) to foster social connection and emotional resilience.
- **Family Education**:
  - Provide family members with guidance on supporting the patient’s emotional and physical needs, emphasizing encouragement without fostering dependency.

### F. Medical and Supportive Interventions
- **Pain and Symptom Management**:
  - Coordinate with the oncology team to manage headache and limb, potentially adjusting medications (e.g., gabapentin for neuropathic symptoms) while monitoring chemotherapy-induced side effects.
  - Address sepsis (CRKP) and pulmonary infection through close collaboration with infectious disease specialists, ensuring rehabilitation does not exacerbate infection risk.
- **Electrolyte and Metabolic Correction**:
  - Regular monitoring and correction of electrolyte imbalances and mixed metabolic acidosis/respiratory alkalosis, adjusting rehabilitation intensity to avoid overexertion.
- **Anemia Management**:
  - Coordinate with hematology for blood transfusions or erythropoietin therapy to address severe anemia (Hb 33 g/L), as improved hemoglobin levels will enhance exercise tolerance.

### G. Monitoring and Progression
- **Weekly Assessments**:
  - Evaluate muscle strength (manual muscle testing), grip/pinch strength, MBI score, BFI, and PHQ-9 to track progress and adjust interventions.
  - Monitor vital signs (SpO₂, HR, BP) during therapy to ensure safety, particularly given cardiopulmonary limitations.
- **Progression Criteria**:
  - Advance exercise intensity/duration when patient sustains activities without significant dyspnea, desaturation, or fatigue exacerbation.
  - Transition to outpatient or home-based rehabilitation once MBI score reaches 50-60 and KPS improves to ≥40.

### H. Precautions
- **Infection Control**: Strict adherence to infection prevention protocols (e.g., hand hygiene, sterile equipment) given sepsis and pulmonary infection risks.
- **Fatigue Management**: Limit sessions to patient’s energy levels, avoiding overexertion (monitor BFI and KPS).
- **Fall Risk**: Use assistive devices and supervision during transfers/standing exercises due to limb weakness and muscle atrophy.
- **Chemotherapy Side Effects**: Adjust therapy intensity based on myelosuppression and treatment-related fatigue, consulting with oncology team as needed.
