# Patient Medical Record

## Case Summary

### I. Basic Information
Middle-aged male patient, previously employed as a secondary school physical education teacher.

### II. Chief Complaint
Headache accompanied by limb weakness for 6 days.

### III. Present Illness
The patient developed paroxysmal cough, expectoration, and dyspnea without obvious cause 1 year ago. Initial anti-infective treatment at a local hospital yielded poor outcomes. Subsequently diagnosed at our hospital with "Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (non-GCB phenotype, Stage IV, aaIPI score 3, high-risk)". Post-chemotherapy in the Hematology Department, the patient developed headache with progressive limb weakness and numbness (predominantly left-sided), diagnosed as "Central Nervous System Invasion by Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma". Under combined insults of lymphoma, recurrent infections, and chemo-radiotherapy, the patient exhibited apathy, worsening dyspnea, fatigue, limb weakness/numbness, significant muscle atrophy, and markedly reduced exercise tolerance, resulting in complete bedrest for 26 days. Limb weakness partially improved after radiotherapy and rehabilitation. Currently admitted for further management. Since onset, the patient has experienced recurrent high fever, significant physical decline, insomnia, and substantial weight loss.

### IV. Past History
Generally healthy previously. No history of infectious diseases (hepatitis, tuberculosis, etc.). No surgical history, trauma, blood transfusion, or donation. No food or drug allergies.

### V. Personal and Psychosocial History
Strong rehabilitation motivation with desire to return to work. Good family support system with attentive care and regular visits from children. Joined lymphoma peer support group for mutual exchange. However, patient experiences anxiety regarding disease recurrence, with reduced self-confidence and social engagement due to fatigue and limb weakness.

### VI. Physical Examination
- **Vital Signs**: Temperature 36.3°C, Pulse 88 bpm, Respiration 20/min, BP 118/60 mmHg.
- **General Condition**: Alert, fair mental status, sallow complexion, thin build, moderate nutrition.
- **Neurological Examination**:
    - **Muscle Strength**: Significant limb muscle atrophy. Right upper limb: proximal V-, distal III; Left upper limb: proximal II, distal I; Bilateral lower limbs: III.
    - **Muscle Tone**: Normal limb muscle tone.
    - **Reflexes**: Symmetric bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar, and Achilles reflexes present.
    - **Sensation**: Reduced superficial sensation in bilateral ulnar palms/dorsal hands; otherwise normal superficial/deep sensation in limbs.
    - **Coordination**: Finger-nose test, rapid alternating movements, and heel-shin test uncompleted due to non-cooperation. Romberg's sign unobtainable.

### VII. Diagnosis
1. Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (non-GCB Stage IV, aaIPI score 3, high-risk) with CNS involvement  
2. Limb Weakness  
3. Sepsis (Carbapenem-Resistant *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, CRKP)  
4. Pulmonary Infection  
5. Chemotherapy-induced Myelosuppression  
6. Electrolyte Imbalance  
7. Mixed Metabolic Acidosis and Respiratory Alkalosis  
8. Hypoalbuminemia  
9. Anemia  

## Pre-rehabilitation Quantitative Assessments

### I. Physiological and Functional Evaluation
- **General Status**: Height 166 cm, Weight 45 kg (fasting).  
- **Cardiopulmonary Function**: Severely reduced exercise tolerance due to anemia (RBC 2×10¹²/L, Hb 33 g/L). Dyspnea and tachycardia after minimal activity; SpO₂ drops below 90%.  
- **Musculoskeletal**:  
    - Bilateral hand joint stiffness with impaired mobility; unable to make fists or perform fine motor tasks.  
    - Significant bilateral lower limb muscle atrophy with limited joint ROM.  
    - **Grip Strength**: Left 10 kg, Right 29 kg.  
    - **Pinch Strength**: Left 0.8 kg, Right 3 kg.  
- **Sensation**: Bilateral hand numbness with objective hypesthesia.  

### II. Functional Scale Assessments
- **Activities of Daily Living (ADL)**: Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score 25 (indicating complete dependence).  
- **Fatigue Assessment**:  
    - **Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS)**: 20 (Severely disabled; hospitalization indicated)  
    - **Zubrod-ECOG-WHO (ZPS)**: 4 (Bedridden)  
    - **Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI)**: 82 (Extreme fatigue within 24 hours)  
- **Psychological Assessment**:  
    - **Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)**: Indicates moderate depression.
