# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (2–4 weeks)
- **Medical stability**: Maintain stable vital signs, prevent infection exacerbation, and optimize anemia and hypoalbuminemia management in coordination with the medical team.
- **Energy conservation**: Reduce fatigue severity by ≥20% on BFI through pacing strategies and graded activity.
- **Basic mobility**: Progress from complete dependence to partial assistance in bed mobility and sitting balance.
- **Joint protection and ROM maintenance**: Prevent further contracture in hands and lower limbs through daily passive and active-assisted range of motion exercises.
- **Upper limb function**: Increase grip strength by ≥2 kg in the left hand and ≥3 kg in the right hand.
- **Psychological support**: Reduce PHQ-9 score by at least 2–3 points through counseling and support interventions.

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months, contingent on oncologic and systemic condition)
- **Functional independence improvement**: MBI ≥60 (able to perform most basic ADLs with minimal assistance).
- **Ambulation**: Achieve assisted standing and short-distance ambulation with a walker, if cardiopulmonary tolerance allows.
- **Upper limb fine motor skills**: Improve pinch strength to ≥2 kg (left) and ≥4.5 kg (right) to enable basic self-care tasks.
- **Endurance**: Maintain SpO₂ ≥94% during light activity with reduced dyspnea.
- **Psychosocial reintegration**: Increase participation in social interactions and confidence in self-care, aiming for return to light teaching or community activities.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 General Medical Coordination
- **Close collaboration** with hematology/oncology, infectious disease, and nutrition teams to manage lymphoma, infection, anemia, electrolyte imbalance, and hypoalbuminemia.
- **Oxygen therapy** during rehabilitation sessions for SpO₂ <92%.
- **Nutritional support**: High-protein, high-calorie diet with possible oral nutritional supplements; address micronutrient deficiencies.

### 2.2 Physical Therapy (PT)
- **Positioning & Pressure Relief**:
  - Reposition every 2 hours to prevent pressure ulcers.
  - Use pressure-relieving mattress and cushions.
- **Respiratory exercises**:
  - Diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing 3–5 minutes, 4–6 times/day to reduce dyspnea.
- **Range of Motion (ROM) training**:
  - Passive and active-assisted ROM for all major joints 2–3 sets/day to maintain mobility and prevent contracture.
- **Bed mobility & balance**:
  - Gradual progression from supported sitting in bed to edge-of-bed sitting with trunk control training.
- **Strength training**:
  - Isometric exercises for major muscle groups (esp. quadriceps, biceps, triceps) in bed.
  - Use of light resistance bands or manual resistance as tolerated.
- **Graded activity program**:
  - Begin with 1–3 minutes of low-intensity exercise, interspersed with rest, increasing duration as tolerated.
  - Monitor heart rate, BP, SpO₂, and symptoms.

### 2.3 Occupational Therapy (OT)
- **Hand function training**:
  - Gentle stretching of hand joints and tendon gliding exercises.
  - Use of therapy putty, sponge squeezing, and small object manipulation for grip/pinch practice.
- **ADL retraining**:
  - Start with self-feeding, grooming, and simple transfers with adaptive devices.
  - Educate on energy conservation and pacing techniques.
- **Splinting**:
  - Consider resting hand splints to prevent contractures and maintain functional position.

### 2.4 Psychological Support
- **Cognitive-behavioral strategies** to address depression and anxiety.
- **Peer support group** participation continuation, with structured sharing sessions.
- **Relaxation training**: Guided imagery, breathing exercises to reduce stress.

### 2.5 Fatigue Management
- **Activity scheduling**: Prioritize meaningful tasks during peak energy times.
- **Pacing**: Alternate activity with adequate rest periods.
- **Sleep hygiene**: Structured bedtime routine, optimize environment for rest.

### 2.6 Patient & Family Education
- Educate family on safe transfer techniques, exercise assistance, and infection prevention.
- Provide home program instructions for ROM, breathing exercises, and hand function training.

### 2.7 Safety Precautions
- Fall prevention: Call bell within reach, supervised mobilization.
- Monitor for signs of infection, bleeding (due to myelosuppression), and oxygen desaturation during therapy.
