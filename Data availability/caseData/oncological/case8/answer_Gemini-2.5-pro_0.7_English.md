### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

**1. Rehabilitation Goals**

*   **Short-term goals (within 2-4 weeks):**
    1.  **Prevent Complications of Immobility:** Prevent the development of pressure sores, joint contractures, and deep vein thrombosis.
    2.  **Maintain Respiratory Function:** Prevent pulmonary complications such as atelectasis and aspiration pneumonia through breathing exercises and proper positioning.
    3.  **Manage Fatigue and Conserve Energy:** Educate the patient and family on energy conservation techniques to manage severe fatigue and optimize participation in care.
    4.  **Preserve Existing Muscle Function and Joint Range of Motion (ROM):** Maintain current muscle strength and prevent further loss; maintain full passive ROM in all joints.
    5.  **Provide Psychosocial Support:** Address anxiety and symptoms of depression; foster coping mechanisms and maintain patient motivation.

*   **Long-term goals (contingent on medical stability and response to oncological treatment):**
    1.  **Improve Muscle Strength:** Increase muscle strength in all four limbs to at least Grade III/V to allow for active movement against gravity.
    2.  **Enhance Functional Independence:** Progress from bedridden status to achieving sitting tolerance at the edge of the bed for at least 15 minutes. Improve Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score by targeting basic self-care tasks (e.g., feeding, grooming with assistance).
    3.  **Improve Hand Function:** Increase grip and pinch strength to enable grasping of light objects (e.g., a cup, utensils). Reduce hand stiffness and improve fine motor coordination.
    4.  **Increase Activity Tolerance:** Gradually improve cardiopulmonary endurance to tolerate basic therapy sessions without significant dyspnea or oxygen desaturation.
    5.  **Improve Quality of Life:** Reduce fatigue levels, improve mood, and support the patient's ability to engage with family.

**2. Treatment Methods**

**A. Physical Therapy (PT)**

*   **Positioning and Bed Mobility:**
    *   Implement a strict 2-hour turning schedule to offload pressure points.
    *   Utilize pillows and wedges to maintain proper body alignment in side-lying and supine positions to prevent contractures and nerve compression.
    *   Once medically cleared from sepsis and with improved hemoglobin levels, begin gentle, assisted bed mobility training (e.g., rolling, bridging).

*   **Therapeutic Exercise:**
    *   **Range of Motion:**
        *   Perform passive range of motion (PROM) exercises for all joints of the upper and lower extremities, 10-15 repetitions per joint, twice daily. Pay special attention to hand and ankle joints to prevent stiffness.
        *   Initiate active-assisted range of motion (AAROM) for the right upper limb and bilateral lower limbs, within the patient's tolerance.
    *   **Strengthening:**
        *   Begin with gentle isometric exercises (muscle setting) for major muscle groups (quadriceps, gluteals, biceps, triceps), holding for 5 seconds, 5-10 repetitions as tolerated.
        *   No resistive exercises at this stage due to severe weakness, fatigue, and medical instability.

*   **Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation:**
    *   **Breathing Exercises:** Teach diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing to improve breathing efficiency and manage dyspnea.
    *   **Airway Clearance:** Instruct on assisted coughing techniques to clear secretions.
    *   **Monitoring:** All therapy sessions must be preceded by and include continuous monitoring of vital signs (HR, BP, RR) and SpO₂. **Therapy to be immediately terminated if SpO₂ drops below 90% or if the patient reports significant dizziness, chest pain, or excessive fatigue.**

**B. Occupational Therapy (OT)**

*   **Hand and Upper Extremity Management:**
    *   **Splinting:** Fabricate bilateral resting hand splints to be worn during periods of rest, especially at night, to prevent flexion contractures and maintain a functional hand position.
    *   **Edema Control:** If edema is present, utilize gentle retrograde massage and elevation.
    *   **Sensory Stimulation:** For areas with reduced sensation, provide a sensory stimulation program using various textures (e.g., cotton, velvet, corduroy) to promote sensory re-education.

*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Fatigue Management:**
    *   **Energy Conservation Education:** Teach principles of Pacing, Planning, Prioritizing, and Positioning to the patient and his family to manage extreme fatigue.
    *   **ADL Training:** Focus on bed-level activities. Begin with simple grooming tasks (e.g., washing face) with setup assistance and adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled sponge).
    *   **Adaptive Equipment:** Introduce a universal cuff for the right hand to assist with holding utensils or a toothbrush.

**C. Psychological and Psychosocial Intervention**

*   **Supportive Psychotherapy:** Provide regular sessions to address anxiety related to disease recurrence and grief over functional loss. Utilize active listening and validation.
*   **Cognitive Behavioral Strategies:** Introduce relaxation techniques such as guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation (modified to be passive). Help the patient set small, achievable daily goals (e.g., sitting up with assistance for 5 minutes) to rebuild a sense of control and self-efficacy.
*   **Family Education and Counseling:** Involve the family in goal setting. Educate them on the patient's condition, the rationale for the rehabilitation plan, and their role in providing physical and emotional support without fostering dependence.

**D. Interdisciplinary Collaboration**

*   **Medical Team:** Maintain daily communication with the hematology and infectious disease teams to stay updated on medical status, particularly hemoglobin levels, white blood cell counts, and infection markers, to guide therapy intensity.
*   **Nutrition:** Collaborate closely with a clinical dietitian to address hypoalbuminemia and cachexia, as adequate nutrition is fundamental for tissue repair and energy.
*   **Pain Management:** Coordinate with the primary team to ensure pain is adequately controlled, as it can be a significant barrier to participation in rehabilitation.
