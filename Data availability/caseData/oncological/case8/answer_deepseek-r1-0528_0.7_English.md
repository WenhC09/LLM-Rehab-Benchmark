# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (2-4 weeks):
- Maintain joint ROM to prevent contractures
- Achieve upright sitting tolerance ≥15 minutes with support
- Improve respiratory function (SpO₂ ≥92% at rest)
- Increase grip strength: Left ≥15kg, Right ≥35kg
- Achiece partial weight-bearing transfers with 2-person assist
- Reduce fatigue perception (BFI ≤60/100)
- Attain Modified Barthel Index (MBI) ≥45 (severe dependence)

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve independent bed-chair transfers
- Ambulate 15m with wheeled walker and supervision
- Restore basic ADL independence (MBI ≥60)
- Resume light social participation (support group attendance)
- Return to modified sedentary work tasks
- Normalize sleep-wake cycle

## 2. Treatment Methods
### Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation
- **Threshold inspiratory muscle training (IMT)**: 30% MIP, 5 sets × 6 reps, 2x/day
- **Oxygen-conserving energy techniques**: Paced breathing during activities
- **Bedside cycle ergometry**: Zero-resistance, 5-min sessions with continuous SpO₂ monitoring
- **Postural drainage**: Modified positions with 30° HOB elevation

### Neuromuscular Rehabilitation
- **Progressive resistance training**: 
  - UE: Water-filled gloves (500g start), gravity-eliminated plane exercises
  - LE: Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) to quadriceps at 30Hz, 10min/session
- **Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT)**: Right limb constraint during 30-min ADL sessions
- **Sensorimotor re-education**: 
  - Texture discrimination training for bilateral hands
  - Mirror therapy for left distal UE
- **Weight-bearing progression**: Tilt table standing (15° start) with compression garments

### Functional Training
- **Task-specific ADL simulation**:
  - Feeding: Built-up utensil training
  - Grooming: Adaptive equipment trials (long-handled brushes)
- **Transfer sequencing**: Slide board transfers with bed-chair height differential <10cm
- **Fatigue management**: 1:2 work-rest ratio during therapy sessions

### Adjunctive Therapies
- **Thermal modalities**: Paraffin wax for hand stiffness pre-exercise
- **Compression therapy**: 20-30mmHg sleeves for dependent edema
- **Nutritional coordination**: 1.5g/kg/day protein supplementation
- **Cognitive-behavioral strategies**: Activity pacing diaries and sleep hygiene education

### Precautions & Monitoring
- **Vital sign limits**: Terminate activity if HR >110bpm or SpO₂ <88%
- **Hematologic monitoring**: Defer resistance training if platelets <50×10⁹/L
- **Infection control**: Barrier protection during wound care
- **Pain management**: Pre-medication 30min before therapy during CRKP treatment
