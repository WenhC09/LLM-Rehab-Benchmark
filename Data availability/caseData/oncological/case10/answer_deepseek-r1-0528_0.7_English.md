# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (2-4 weeks):
- Reduce chest pain from NRS 5 to ≤3
- Increase bilateral knee flexion ROM (Right: 100°→115°, Left: 110°→120°)
- Maintain Barthel Index ≥90 through activity modification training
- Prevent respiratory function decline through pulmonary hygiene
- Stabilize weight through nutritional intervention

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Maintain independent ADL performance (Barthel ≥90) despite disease progression
- Preserve current IADL capacity (Lawton ≥22) including transportation adaptation
- Minimize cancer-related fatigue impact on daily participation
- Prevent musculoskeletal deconditioning secondary to treatment
- Optimize cardiopulmonary reserve for potential oncologic interventions

## 2. Treatment Methods
### A. Pain Management Program
- **Modalities**: Superficial heat therapy for knee joints (20 mins/session, BID)
- **Therapeutic Exercise**: Gentle thoracic mobility drills (seated rotations) with pain-contingent progression
- **Education**: Body mechanics training for ADL performance with chest wall protection

### B. Pulmonary Rehabilitation
- **Breathing Retraining**: Pursed-lip breathing + diaphragmatic patterning (5 reps, 4x/day)
- **Airway Clearance**: Active cycle of breathing technique with postural drainage positioning
- **Endurance Training**: Interval walking program (2-min walk/1-min rest cycles) with SpO₂ monitoring

### C. Musculoskeletal Intervention
- **Knee ROM Restoration**:  
  - Passive/active-assisted knee flexion slides (supine)  
  - Prone knee flexion with towel traction  
  - Frequency: 10 reps/hour during waking hours
- **Strength Preservation**:  
  - Quadriceps isometrics (6-sec hold, 10 reps TID)  
  - Ankle pump resistance training (elastic band)

### D. Functional Capacity Building
- **ADL Adaptation**:  
  - Stair negotiation training with step-to pattern  
  - Energy conservation strategies for household tasks  
- **IADL Optimization**:  
  - Community mobility simulation (transport access training)  
  - Activity pacing education with rest-break scheduling  

### E. Supportive Therapies
- **Nutritional Support**:  
  - High-protein/calorie supplementation (1.5g protein/kg/day)  
  - Small frequent meal planning to counter weight loss  
- **Oncology Rehabilitation Precautions**:  
  - Avoid thoracic manual techniques due to tumor location  
  - Monitor for superior vena cava syndrome signs during exercise  
  - Coordinate with oncology for treatment-timing integration  

### F. Monitoring Parameters
- Vital signs pre/post exercise (BP, SpO₂, dyspnea scale)
- Daily pain diary with activity-pain correlation
- Weekly knee goniometry measurements
- Biweekly body weight tracking
