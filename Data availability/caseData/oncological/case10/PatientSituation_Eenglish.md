# Case Information Summary

## I. Case Summary

**Chief Complaint and Present Illness**: An elderly female patient presented with cough, sputum production, and back pain without obvious precipitating factors one month prior. Symptoms occasionally included chest tightness, dizziness, and headache, with no fever, chills, or syncope. Over ten days ago, a chest CT at a local hospital revealed a dense shadow in the right lower lobe, accompanied by bilateral emphysema, possible bilateral chronic pulmonary infection and chronic bronchitis, mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, and bilateral pleural thickening. Subsequent fiberoptic bronchoscopy and pathological analysis confirmed squamous cell carcinoma. The patient was subsequently referred to our outpatient department. Currently, the patient’s general health is fair, with normal mental status, diet, and sleep. However, she has experienced a 4kg weight loss over the past month. ECOG score is 1, NRS score is 1.

**Past Medical History**: Generally healthy. History of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Denies history of tuberculosis. Vaccination history includes BCG, poliomyelitis, measles, DPT, and Japanese encephalitis vaccines as per schedule. No history of allergies, trauma, surgery, or blood transfusion. No other significant medical history.

**Physical Examination**: Temperature 36.3°C, Pulse 76 bpm, Respiration 20 bpm, Blood Pressure 139/96 mmHg. Alert, fair mental status, slightly pale complexion, no specific facies. Moderate body build and nutritional status. Normal development. Responsive with clear speech, normal voice, and even breathing pattern. Cooperative with examination. Ambulatory upon admission. No significant superficial lymphadenopathy palpable. Chest examination unremarkable: bilateral symmetrical respiratory movements without obvious enhancement or weakening. Normal bilateral tactile fremitus. No pleural friction rub. Percussion notes resonant. Clear breath sounds bilaterally on auscultation, with no dry or moist rales. Cardiac examination normal: regular rhythm, no pathological murmurs auscultated over valve areas.

**Clinical Diagnoses**:
1.  Right lung squamous cell carcinoma with metastasis to right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes T₂N₂Mx;
2.  Hepatitis B virus carrier;
3.  Fibrotic foci in the right middle lobe and lingular segment of the right upper lobe;
4.  Coronary artery and aortic calcified plaques;
5.  Multiple ischemic changes in the brain.

## II. Pre-Rehabilitation Quantitative Examination and Assessment

### 1. Functional Assessment

*   **Respiratory Function**: No signs of dyspnea.
*   **Motor Function**:
    *   Muscle Strength Assessment: Grade IV muscle strength in all four limbs.
    *   Range of Motion Assessment: Restricted bilateral knee joint motion (Right knee flexion 100°, Left knee flexion 110°).
*   **Sensory Function**: Chest pain score (NRS) is 5.
*   **Psychological Function**: PHQ-9 screening showed no anxiety or depression.

### 2. Structural Assessment

*   **Contrast-Enhanced Chest CT**: Symmetric thorax. An irregular soft tissue mass shadow approximately 7.2 cm × 5.3 cm is seen in the right hilum and right upper lobe, containing a cavity with an air-fluid level, demonstrating heterogeneous enhancement post-contrast. The mass encases the right upper lobe bronchus and right superior pulmonary artery/vein, causing partial luminal stenosis and truncation. Ill-defined boundaries locally between the mass and the brachiocephalic vein. Superior vena cava compressed and narrowed. Multiple nodular shadows, ground-glass opacities, and consolidation shadows surround the mass, with adjacent pleural thickening and adhesion. Scattered small nodular shadows (diameter 0.2 ~ 0.4 cm) in both lungs, some ground-glass density, some calcified. Small cystic lucency in the left upper lobe. A few linear shadows in the lingular segment of the left upper lobe. Increased number and size of lymph nodes in the mediastinum and right hilum, some with heterogeneous enhancement; the largest measures approximately 1.7 cm in short axis. Heart size normal, no pericardial effusion. Calcification seen in the aorta and bilateral coronary arteries. No pleural effusion bilaterally.
*   **Painless Fiberoptic Bronchoscopy**: Bronchoscope passed smoothly through the laryngeal mask into the glottis. Epiglottis smooth. Bilateral vocal cord structure normal. Tracheal cartilaginous rings clear, mucosa smooth, normal color, lumen patent. Carina sharp. Left bronchi at all levels unremarkable: mucosa smooth, normal color, lumen patent, no bleeding, stenosis, or neoplasm observed. Examination of the right bronchi revealed mucosal infiltration and congestion with luminal narrowing in the right upper lobe bronchus. The carina between the right upper lobe bronchus and right intermediate bronchus appeared normal. Mucosa smooth and lumen patent in other right bronchi.
*   **Pathological Biopsy Diagnosis**: Non-small cell carcinoma, suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry recommended for auxiliary diagnosis.

### 3. Activity Assessment

*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Assessment**: Barthel Index score 90/100. Primary limitation: independent stair climbing/descending. 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) showed no indication of heart failure.
*   **Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Assessment**: Lawton IADL Scale score 22/24. Primary limitation: using transportation during outdoor activities.

### 4. Participation Assessment
No observed limitations in occupational, recreational, or social participation.
