# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-term goals (within 4-6 weeks, during the pre-treatment/initial treatment phase):
*   **Pain Control:** Reduce chest pain from a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score of 5 to ≤ 2 to facilitate participation in therapeutic activities and improve quality of life.
*   **Respiratory Function Optimization:**
    *   Independently perform airway clearance techniques (e.g., Active Cycle of Breathing Technique) to effectively manage sputum production.
    *   Master diaphragmatic and pursed-lip breathing techniques to manage potential exertional dyspnea.
    *   Maintain oxygen saturation (SpO₂) ≥ 92% during light to moderate therapeutic exercise.
*   **Musculoskeletal Improvement:**
    *   Increase muscle strength in all four extremities from Grade IV to Grade IV+.
    *   Improve active range of motion of bilateral knees to ≥ 115° of flexion to facilitate stair climbing.
*   **Functional Mobility:**
    *   Improve stair climbing ability to ascend and descend one flight of stairs (12-15 steps) with the use of a handrail and minimal assistance.
*   **Patient Education:**
    *   Educate the patient and family on energy conservation techniques and signs/symptoms of potential complications (e.g., Superior Vena Cava Syndrome, worsening dyspnea).

#### Long-term goals (throughout and following oncological treatment):
*   **Maintain Functional Independence:** Preserve Activities of Daily Living (ADL) with a Barthel Index score of ≥ 90.
*   **Preserve Quality of Life:** Minimize the impact of cancer-related fatigue and pain, enabling continued participation in meaningful social and family activities.
*   **Prevent Complications:** Mitigate treatment-related deconditioning, prevent joint contractures, and reduce the risk of respiratory complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia.
*   **Enhance Treatment Tolerance:** Optimize physical condition to better tolerate planned oncological therapies (chemotherapy/radiotherapy) and manage their side effects.

### 2. Treatment Methods

#### A. Pain Management
*   **Physical Modalities:** Application of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) to the thoracic region, avoiding direct placement over the tumor site, to modulate pain signals.
*   **Therapeutic Positioning:** Instruction on optimal resting and sleeping positions to offload the painful chest wall and reduce discomfort.
*   **Manual Therapy:** Gentle soft tissue mobilization on compensatory tight musculature (e.g., pectoral, intercostal, and paraspinal muscles) to alleviate secondary musculoskeletal pain.
*   **Coordination:** Collaborate with the primary medical team on scheduling analgesic medication to ensure peak effect during therapy sessions.

#### B. Therapeutic Exercise
*   **Aerobic Conditioning:**
    *   **Modality:** Stationary cycling or level-ground walking.
    *   **Prescription:** Begin with 15-20 minute sessions, 3-5 days per week.
    *   **Intensity:** Low to moderate, targeting a Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) of 11-13 ("Fairly light" to "Somewhat hard").
    *   **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, and SpO₂ due to underlying coronary artery disease.
*   **Strength Training:**
    *   **Lower Extremities:** Focus on functional strengthening. Exercises include sit-to-stands, mini-squats, heel raises, and bridging. Start with 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions.
    *   **Upper Extremities & Core:** Light resistance training using elastic bands or 1-2 kg weights for major muscle groups. Include wall push-ups and seated core exercises to improve postural stability.
*   **Flexibility and Range of Motion:**
    *   Active and active-assisted range of motion exercises for all major joints, with specific focus on heel slides and gentle passive stretching to improve bilateral knee flexion.
    *   Gentle chest wall and pectoral stretching to improve thoracic mobility and counteract postural changes.

#### C. Pulmonary Rehabilitation
*   **Breathing Retraining:**
    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing:** To improve breathing efficiency, reduce accessory muscle use, and enhance gas exchange.
    *   **Pursed-Lip Breathing:** To control respiratory rate and relieve sensations of dyspnea during exertion.
*   **Airway Clearance Techniques:**
    *   Instruction in the **Active Cycle of Breathing Technique (ACBT)** to effectively mobilize and clear secretions.
    *   Training in **directed coughing and huffing** to clear sputum with less energy expenditure and pain.
*   **Lung Expansion:** Use of an incentive spirometer to promote deep inspiration, prevent atelectasis, and maintain lung volumes.

#### D. Functional Activity Training
*   **Stair Training:** Supervised practice on stairs, focusing on reciprocal patterns, use of handrails, and energy conservation.
*   **Balance Training:** Static and dynamic balance exercises (e.g., standing with a narrowed base of support, gentle weight shifting) to improve stability and reduce fall risk, especially given the patient's age and generalized weakness.
*   **Energy Conservation & Work Simplification:** Instruction on pacing activities throughout the day, sitting for tasks when possible, and organizing the home environment to minimize physical demand.

#### E. Patient and Family Education
*   **Symptom Monitoring:** Detailed education on recognizing and immediately reporting signs of Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (facial/neck swelling, headache, distended neck veins), worsening dyspnea, uncontrolled pain, or new neurological symptoms.
*   **Nutritional Collaboration:** Emphasize the importance of maintaining adequate caloric and protein intake to combat cancer cachexia and support physical function. Recommend consultation with a registered dietitian.
