# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-Term Goals:
*   Alleviate adverse reactions post-chemoradiotherapy and prevent potential decline in respiratory and motor functions caused by the disease itself or chemoradiotherapy.
*   Correct potential malnutrition and cachexia risk, while providing psychological support and reinforcement.

### Long-Term Goals:
*   Reduce tumor recurrence and mortality rates, improving patient survival.
*   Maintain social participation capacity, ultimately enhancing overall quality of life.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### **Dynamic Complication Assessment:**
Utilize the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) for dynamic patient assessment.

### **Rehabilitation Therapy:**
*   **Respiratory Function Training:**
    *   The regimen integrates breathing exercises performed on benches and mats with upper and lower limb endurance training using rowing machines, treadmills, and stationary bicycles.
    *   Training emphasizes restoring respiratory muscle strength and alleviating skeletal muscle weakness through the use of vibratory positive expiratory pressure devices combined with incentive spirometry.
    *   Initiate upon patient stabilization, performed 3-5 times daily, with 5-10 repetitions per session.

*   **Exercise Therapy:**
    *   Encourage early initiation of moderate, individualized exercise.
    *   Initial activities include daily climbing of 1-2 flights of stairs or brisk walking for 1-2 kilometers, progressively increasing intensity based on tolerance.
    *   Introduce activities conducive to pulmonary recovery, such as swimming, once condition stabilizes.
    *   Implement multicomponent exercise training twice weekly for 45-50 minutes per session to improve muscle strength, cardiopulmonary fitness, and psychological state.

*   **Physical Agent Modalities:** Address potential radiation-induced skin damage with:
    *   **Oxygen Therapy:** Apply high-flow oxygen to enhance local tissue oxygenation, inhibit anaerobic bacterial growth, promote wound desiccation, reduce exudate, and accelerate healing.
    *   **Laser Therapy:** Utilize laser irradiation to induce vasodilation, improve local microcirculation, stimulate fibroblast proliferation and epithelial regeneration, and modulate immune function.
    *   **Millimeter Wave Therapy:** Leverage resonance effects between millimeter waves and human tissues to optimize microstructure, regulate protein and enzyme bioactivity, and promote tissue repair and ulcer healing.

*   **Patient Health Education:**
    *   Implement a health promotion program based on the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation - Behavior (COM-B) model. Intervene across five domains: enhancing physical skills, imparting health knowledge, providing social support, optimizing the rehabilitation environment, and boosting self-efficacy to encourage adoption and maintenance of healthy behaviors.

*   **Long-Term Follow-Up & Dynamic Assessment:**
    *   Conduct regular patient monitoring and provide professional smoking cessation guidance and healthy lifestyle education to minimize the risk of tumor recurrence and mortality.
