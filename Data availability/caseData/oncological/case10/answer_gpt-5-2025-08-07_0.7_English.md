# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks)
- Relieve chest pain to NRS ≤3 through multimodal pain management.
- Maintain current muscle strength (≥Grade IV) and prevent further decline.
- Improve bilateral knee flexion range of motion by at least 5–10° to facilitate mobility.
- Maintain or improve current ADL score (Barthel Index ≥90) and prevent decline in functional independence.
- Optimize respiratory function and reduce risk of pulmonary complications during oncologic treatment.
- Provide education on energy conservation and breathing techniques in preparation for upcoming cancer therapy.

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months)
- Preserve independent living ability with Barthel Index ≥90 and Lawton IADL ≥22.
- Maintain or improve exercise tolerance (6MWT distance stable or improved from baseline).
- Prevent secondary complications from cancer and its treatment (e.g., deconditioning, pulmonary infections, joint contractures).
- Support psychological resilience and quality of life during the course of oncologic management.
- Achieve optimal pain control with minimal interference in daily activities.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 Pain Management
- **Pharmacological**: Coordinate with oncology and internal medicine teams to adjust analgesics (e.g., stepwise WHO analgesic ladder, considering NSAIDs or weak opioids if appropriate, with caution due to HBV status and cardiovascular calcifications).
- **Non-pharmacological**: Local heat therapy for chest wall discomfort, gentle thoracic mobility exercises, relaxation training.

### 2.2 Respiratory Rehabilitation
- **Breathing exercises**: Diaphragmatic breathing, pursed-lip breathing (2–3 sessions/day, 10 repetitions/session).
- **Airway clearance techniques**: Active cycle of breathing techniques to manage sputum, especially in context of chronic bronchitis and emphysema findings.
- **Thoracic expansion exercises**: Gentle stretching to maintain chest wall mobility.

### 2.3 Physical Function and Mobility Training
- **Lower limb joint ROM training**: Passive and active-assisted stretching for bilateral knees (focus on flexion), 2–3 times/day.
- **Strength maintenance**: Low to moderate resistance training for major muscle groups, 3 times/week, avoiding fatigue.
- **Gait and balance training**: Walking practice, stair negotiation under supervision to address primary ADL limitation.
- **Energy conservation**: Teach pacing strategies to avoid overexertion during activities.

### 2.4 Cardiovascular Conditioning
- **Aerobic exercise**: Low-intensity walking or stationary cycling, 10–20 minutes/day, 5 days/week, closely monitoring heart rate and symptoms due to coronary calcification.

### 2.5 ADL and IADL Support
- **Functional training**: Simulated stair climbing with rest breaks; transportation planning and mobility aids if needed for IADL support.
- **Home safety**: Education for fall prevention.

### 2.6 Psychological Support
- **Psychoeducation**: Information on disease, rehabilitation process, and coping strategies.
- **Monitoring**: Regular screening for depression/anxiety despite current negative PHQ-9 result.

### 2.7 Nutritional Support
- **Dietary counseling**: High-protein, high-calorie diet to address recent weight loss and support immune function during cancer treatment.
- **HBV considerations**: Limit hepatotoxic substances; coordinate with hepatology.

### 2.8 Coordination with Oncology
- **Prehabilitation**: Optimize physical status before initiation of oncologic interventions (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy).
- **Symptom monitoring**: Early detection of treatment-related complications (fatigue, neuropathy, pulmonary toxicity).

### 2.9 Patient and Family Education
- **Training**: Teach home exercise program, breathing techniques, signs of complications.
- **Engagement**: Involve family in support and assistance with ADLs/IADLs as needed.

**Follow-up and Reassessment**: Re-evaluate functional status, pain, and participation every 2–4 weeks; adjust plan according to oncologic treatment course and patient tolerance.
