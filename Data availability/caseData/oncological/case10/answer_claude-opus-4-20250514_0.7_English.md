# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Improve respiratory function and reduce chest pain (NRS score from 5 to 3).
- Increase muscle strength in all extremities to Grade V.
- Enhance range of motion in bilateral knees to at least 120Â° flexion.
- Support nutritional intake to prevent further weight loss.

### Long-term goals:
- Maintain functional independence in activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL).
- Improve overall physical endurance and quality of life.
- Facilitate psychological well-being and coping strategies related to cancer diagnosis.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### A. Respiratory Rehabilitation:
- **Breathing Exercises**: Diaphragmatic and pursed-lip breathing techniques to enhance lung capacity and reduce dyspnea.
- **Airway Clearance Techniques**: Use of postural drainage and percussion to facilitate sputum clearance.

### B. Physical Rehabilitation:
- **Strength Training**: Progressive resistance exercises focusing on major muscle groups, particularly in the lower extremities, to improve muscle strength.
- **Range of Motion Exercises**: Gentle stretching and mobilization exercises for the knees to improve flexibility and prevent contractures.
- **Aerobic Conditioning**: Low-impact aerobic exercises (e.g., walking, stationary cycling) to enhance cardiovascular fitness and endurance.

### C. Nutritional Support:
- **Dietary Consultation**: Engage a dietitian to develop a high-protein, high-calorie meal plan to address weight loss and nutritional needs.
- **Nutritional Supplements**: Consider protein shakes or supplements to support caloric intake.

### D. Pain Management:
- **Pain Management Strategies**: Utilize pharmacological interventions as needed, along with non-pharmacological methods such as heat therapy and relaxation techniques.

### E. Psychological Support:
- **Counseling Services**: Provide access to psychological support or counseling to address emotional well-being and coping strategies.
- **Support Groups**: Encourage participation in support groups for cancer patients to foster social interaction and emotional support.

### F. Education and Training:
- **Patient and Family Education**: Educate the patient and family about the disease process, treatment options, and self-management strategies.
- **Home Exercise Program**: Develop a tailored home exercise program to encourage continued physical activity outside of therapy sessions.

### G. Follow-up and Monitoring:
- **Regular Assessments**: Schedule follow-up assessments to monitor progress in strength, range of motion, respiratory function, and pain levels.
- **Adjust Treatment Plan**: Modify the rehabilitation plan based on the patient's progress and any changes in their condition.
