# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4-8 weeks):
- Improve respiratory function to reduce chest tightness and enhance exercise tolerance.
- Increase bilateral knee joint range of motion (target: right knee flexion to 110°, left knee flexion to 120°).
- Reduce chest pain (NRS score from 5 to ≤3).
- Maintain or improve Barthel Index score (≥90/100) and Lawton IADL score (≥22/24).
- Enhance physical endurance to support upcoming oncological treatments.

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- Optimize respiratory function to support daily activities without chest tightness or dyspnea.
- Achieve full knee joint range of motion (right and left knee flexion ≥130°).
- Maintain chest pain at minimal levels (NRS score ≤1).
- Achieve full independence in ADL and IADL (Barthel Index 100/100, Lawton IADL 24/24).
- Support overall physical and functional capacity to tolerate cancer treatment and maintain quality of life.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Respiratory Rehabilitation
- **Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program**:
  - **Diaphragmatic Breathing Exercises**: 10-15 minutes, 3 times daily, to enhance lung expansion and reduce chest tightness. Instruct patient to inhale deeply through the nose, expanding the abdomen, and exhale slowly through pursed lips.
  - **Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT)**: Use a threshold IMT device at 30% of maximum inspiratory pressure, 10-15 repetitions, 2 sessions daily, to strengthen respiratory muscles and improve exercise tolerance.
  - **Aerobic Exercise**: Supervised low-intensity walking (20-30 minutes, 3-5 times per week, at 50-60% of maximum heart rate) to improve cardiovascular endurance and support 6MWT performance.
- **Airway Clearance Techniques**: Teach active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) to manage sputum production, 10-15 minutes daily, including breathing control, thoracic expansion, and forced expiratory techniques.

### Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation
- **Knee Joint Mobility Exercises**:
  - **Passive and Active Range of Motion (ROM) Exercises**: Perform gentle stretching and active knee flexion/extension exercises, 10 repetitions, 2-3 sets daily, targeting increased flexion (right knee to 110°, left knee to 120°).
  - **Quadriceps and Hamstring Strengthening**: Isometric exercises (e.g., quad sets, straight leg raises), 10-15 repetitions, 2 sets daily, to support knee stability and improve muscle strength to Grade V.
- **General Strength Training**: Low-resistance exercises for upper and lower limbs (e.g., seated arm curls, leg presses with light resistance), 10-12 repetitions, 2 sets, 3 times per week, to maintain Grade IV muscle strength and prevent further decline.

### Pain Management
- **Non-Pharmacological Pain Relief**:
  - **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)**: Apply TENS to the chest wall (30 minutes, 2-3 times weekly) to reduce NRS score from 5 to ≤3.
  - **Relaxation Techniques**: Guided progressive muscle relaxation (15 minutes daily) to alleviate chest pain and reduce stress.
- **Positioning and Postural Training**: Educate patient on optimal sitting and lying positions to minimize chest wall strain during daily activities.

### Functional Training
- **ADL Training**:
  - **Stair Climbing/Descending Practice**: Supervised training with handrail support, 5-10 repetitions, 2 times daily, to improve independence in stair navigation (target: Barthel Index 100/100).
  - **Transportation Skills**: Simulate outdoor mobility scenarios (e.g., entering/exiting vehicles) with occupational therapist guidance, 1-2 sessions weekly, to improve Lawton IADL score to 24/24.
- **Energy Conservation Techniques**: Teach pacing and prioritization strategies (e.g., breaking tasks into smaller steps, using assistive devices like a walker for longer distances) to maintain functional independence and reduce fatigue.

### Education and Support
- **Patient Education**: Provide counseling on lung cancer, its impact on physical function, and the importance of adherence to rehabilitation. Discuss energy conservation and symptom management (e.g., recognizing signs of chest tightness or fatigue).
- **Nutritional Guidance**: Collaborate with a dietitian to address 4kg weight loss and optimize nutritional intake to support energy needs and treatment tolerance.
- **Psychological Support**: Although PHQ-9 indicates no anxiety or depression, offer weekly counseling sessions to monitor psychological status and provide coping strategies for living with a cancer diagnosis.

### Monitoring and Follow-Up
- **Weekly Assessments**: Monitor NRS pain score, knee ROM, and respiratory symptoms (e.g., chest tightness, sputum production). Adjust exercise intensity based on patient tolerance.
- **Monthly Evaluations**: Reassess Barthel Index, Lawton IADL, and 6MWT to track functional progress. Review respiratory function with pulse oximetry during exercise.
- **Coordination with Oncology Team**: Regular communication to align rehabilitation with planned cancer treatments (e.g., chemotherapy or radiotherapy) and manage potential side effects like fatigue or reduced endurance.
