# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

**Date of Plan:** January 12, 2024 (Based on case timeline)

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

Given the patient's critical medical condition, including active intra-abdominal and pulmonary infections, severe frailty (CFS 8), and profound functional deficits, the initial rehabilitation goals must prioritize stabilization, prevention of secondary complications, and support of primary medical treatments.

### Short-term goals (within 2-4 weeks):

1.  **Medical Stability Support:**
    *   Assist in the management of respiratory secretions to improve gas exchange and help resolve pulmonary infection.
    *   Maintain vital signs within a safe range during all therapeutic activities (e.g., HR < 120 bpm, SpO2 > 92%).
2.  **Prevention of Secondary Complications:**
    *   Prevent the development of pressure injuries through a structured positioning schedule.
    *   Maintain full passive range of motion in all four limbs to prevent joint contractures, with special attention to the paretic left side.
    *   Prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) through mechanical prophylaxis and early mobilization as tolerated.
3.  **Functional Improvement (Basic):**
    *   Improve bed mobility from total dependence to requiring maximal assistance for rolling.
    *   Achieve stable, supported sitting tolerance at the edge of the bed for at least 5 minutes without significant hemodynamic compromise.
    *   Improve MBI score from 20 to 30, focusing on assisted feeding (if oral intake resumes) and upper body grooming.
4.  **Symptom Management:**
    *   Reduce resting pain score from VAS 5 to < 3.
    *   Improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety/depression symptoms through non-pharmacological interventions and collaboration with the primary and psychiatric teams.

### Long-term goals (within 1-3 months, contingent on medical stabilization):

1.  **Mobility:**
    *   Achieve independent bed mobility (rolling, moving up/down in bed).
    *   Progress from sitting at the edge of the bed to performing stand-pivot transfers with moderate to minimal assistance.
    *   Achieve stable sitting balance (Level 2-3) to allow for participation in self-care activities from a seated position.
    *   *Aspirational:* Tolerate standing in a parallel bar for 1-2 minutes with maximal assistance. Independent ambulation is not a realistic goal at this stage.
2.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):**
    *   Improve ADL independence to a level requiring minimal assistance for feeding, grooming, and upper body dressing (Target MBI > 60).
    *   Participate with supervision in lower body dressing and toileting transfers.
3.  **Cardiopulmonary Endurance:**
    *   Improve cardiovascular tolerance to sustain light physical activity for 15-20 minutes with appropriate rest breaks.
4.  **Psychosocial Function:**
    *   Reduce HAMA and HAMD scores to mild-moderate ranges.
    *   Empower the patient and family with knowledge and strategies for managing long-term disability and stoma care.

## 2. Treatment Methods

**General Principle:** All rehabilitation interventions must be closely coordinated with the primary medical and surgical teams. Treatment will be of low intensity and guided by daily assessment of the patient's physiological tolerance, with particular attention to signs of infection, pain, and hemodynamic stability.

### A. Physical Therapy (PT)

1.  **Respiratory Physiotherapy:**
    *   **Postural Drainage:** Implement positions to facilitate drainage from affected lung segments, coordinated with nursing care and avoiding pressure on the abdominal wound.
    *   **Breathing Exercises:** Instruct in diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing to improve ventilation and reduce work of breathing.
    *   **Secretion Clearance:** Utilize assisted coughing and huffing techniques. Gentle manual vibration/percussion may be considered if tolerated and not contraindicated by the abdominal condition or pain.

2.  **Positioning and Bed Mobility:**
    *   **Therapeutic Positioning:** Institute a strict 2-hour turning schedule. Use pillows and wedges to maintain neutral alignment, offload bony prominences (sacrum, heels, trochanters), and prevent contractures in the paretic left limbs (e.g., shoulder adduction/internal rotation, hip flexion/external rotation, ankle plantarflexion).
    *   **Bed Mobility Training:** Begin with passive rolling, progressing to active-assisted rolling using bed rails and overhead trapeze if available and safe.

3.  **Therapeutic Exercise:**
    *   **Range of Motion (ROM):**
        *   **Passive ROM:** Perform twice daily for all joints, with emphasis on the left upper and lower extremities to address UMN-related spasticity and weakness.
        *   **Active-Assisted ROM:** Encourage for the right side and upper limbs to maintain strength.
    *   **Strengthening:**
        *   Initiate gentle isometric exercises (quadriceps sets, gluteal sets) for both lower extremities as tolerated, to mitigate disuse atrophy.
        *   Begin active resistive exercises for the right upper and lower limbs using light resistance (e.g., therapy bands) once medically stable.
    *   **Neuromuscular Re-education:** For the left side, incorporate proprioceptive input and facilitation techniques to improve awareness and activation.

4.  **Functional Mobility Training:**
    *   **Sitting Balance:** Once cleared for mobilization, begin with elevating the head of the bed. Progress to dangling feet at the edge of the bed with maximum trunk support. Focus on achieving static sitting balance before introducing dynamic activities.
    *   **Transfer Training:** Will be initiated only after the patient achieves fair sitting balance and improved strength (MMT > 3/5 in key muscle groups). Initial training will focus on sit-to-stand mechanics with maximal assistance.

### B. Occupational Therapy (OT)

1.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training:**
    *   **Bedside Activities:** Focus on simple, energy-efficient tasks such as self-feeding (once oral intake is established), washing face and hands, and oral hygiene from a supported seated position in bed.
    *   **Adaptive Equipment:** Introduce long-handled sponges or universal cuffs as needed to compensate for weakness.

2.  **Upper Extremity Management:**
    *   **Splinting:** Assess the left upper extremity for spasticity. If tone is increased and interferes with function or hygiene, fabricate a resting hand splint to maintain joint alignment and prevent contractures.
    *   **Functional Task Practice:** Engage the right upper extremity in purposeful activities to maintain strength and coordination. Incorporate bilateral activities as tolerated to address potential unilateral neglect secondary to the suspected right-hemispheric insult.

3.  **Cognitive and Perceptual Assessment/Intervention:**
    *   Screen for unilateral neglect, attention deficits, and executive dysfunction given the neurological signs. Provide simple, one-step commands and orient the patient frequently.

4.  **Energy Conservation and Work Simplification:**
    *   Educate the patient on pacing activities, taking frequent rest breaks, and organizing the immediate environment (bedside table) for easy access to essential items.

### C. Pain, Psychological, and Nutritional Management (Collaborative)

1.  **Pain Management:**
    *   Coordinate with the primary team to ensure adequate pharmacological pain control is administered *prior* to therapy sessions.
    *   Utilize non-pharmacological methods such as proper positioning, relaxation breathing techniques, and distraction.

2.  **Psychological Support:**
    *   Immediate consultation with the psychiatry/psychology service is warranted based on severe HAMA/HAMD scores.
    *   Establish a therapeutic rapport, provide positive reinforcement for small gains, and engage in active listening.
    *   Involve family in goal setting to manage expectations and provide support.

3.  **Nutritional Support:**
    *   Advocate for and collaborate with the nutrition support team to ensure aggressive nutritional repletion (likely via parenteral or enteral routes initially), as this is a prerequisite for wound healing, immune function, and any potential for physical recovery. Progress in rehabilitation is entirely dependent on improving the patient's nutritional and metabolic state.
