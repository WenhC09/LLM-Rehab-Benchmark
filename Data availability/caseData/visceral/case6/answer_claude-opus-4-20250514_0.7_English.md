# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Improve wound healing and manage infection effectively.
- Achieve stable vital signs and improve overall medical condition.
- Increase muscle strength in lower limbs to at least 4/5.
- Enhance sitting and standing balance to a level where the patient can maintain a sitting position independently.
- Improve activities of daily living (ADLs) score to at least 40 on the Modified Barthel Index (MBI).
- Address pain management to reduce Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score to 3 or below.
- Enhance sleep quality, aiming for a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 10 or below.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve full recovery of gastrointestinal function and independence in bowel management.
- Attain full mobility and independence in ADLs, targeting a Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score of 100.
- Improve overall physical endurance and strength to support safe ambulation and participation in social activities.
- Enhance psychological well-being, aiming for a reduction in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores to below 20.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### Medical Management:
- Continue antibiotic therapy to manage abdominal wall infection and prevent further complications.
- Monitor and manage hypertension with appropriate medications.
- Regular wound care and assessment to promote healing and prevent infection.

### Physical Rehabilitation:
- **Passive Range of Motion (ROM) Exercises**: Initiate passive ROM exercises for lower limbs to maintain joint mobility and prevent contractures.
- **Strengthening Exercises**: Gradually introduce isometric exercises for lower limbs, focusing on proximal and distal muscle groups, progressing to active-assisted exercises as tolerated.
- **Balance Training**: Implement sitting balance exercises using support, progressing to standing balance exercises with assistance as strength improves.

### Occupational Therapy:
- **ADL Training**: Provide training and assistance in basic self-care tasks, such as grooming, dressing, and toileting, using adaptive equipment as necessary.
- **Energy Conservation Techniques**: Educate the patient on pacing and energy conservation strategies to manage fatigue during daily activities.

### Psychological Support:
- **Counseling and Support Groups**: Refer the patient for psychological counseling to address anxiety and depression, and encourage participation in support groups for emotional support.
- **Sleep Hygiene Education**: Provide education on sleep hygiene practices to improve sleep quality.

### Nutritional Support:
- Collaborate with a dietitian to develop a nutritional plan that supports wound healing and addresses gastrointestinal function, focusing on high-protein, low-residue diets as tolerated.

### Multidisciplinary Approach:
- Regular team meetings involving physicians, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and dietitians to monitor progress and adjust the rehabilitation plan as needed.
