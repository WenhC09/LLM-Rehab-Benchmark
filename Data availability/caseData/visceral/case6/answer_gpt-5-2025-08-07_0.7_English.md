# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks)
- **Medical stability**: Maintain stable vital signs, control infection (abdominal wall and pulmonary), ensure adequate drainage and wound management.
- **Pain control**: Reduce VAS pain score from 5 to ≤3 to facilitate participation in rehabilitation.
- **Nutritional improvement**: Correct malnutrition through enteral/parenteral nutrition as tolerated; prevent further weight loss.
- **Gastrointestinal function**: Promote recovery to AGI grade I or better, improve bowel sound score.
- **Basic mobility**: Achieve ability to maintain supported sitting for ≥5 minutes; improve proximal lower limb muscle strength from grade 3 to ≥grade 4.
- **ADL improvement**: Increase MBI from 20 to ≥30 points through training and compensatory techniques.
- **Emotional status**: Reduce HAMA and HAMD scores by ≥25% through psychological interventions and supportive care.
- **Sleep quality**: Reduce PSQI score by ≥3 points.

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months, depending on surgical course and wound healing)
- **Functional independence**: Achieve independent bed mobility and ability to transfer with minimal assistance; progress to ambulation with assistive device if possible.
- **ADL independence**: MBI ≥60 points, capable of basic self-care with minimal assistance.
- **Cardiopulmonary endurance**: Improve tolerance to ≥6 minutes of low-intensity activity without desaturation or undue fatigue.
- **Wound healing**: Achieve full epithelialization of abdominal wall defect or readiness for reconstructive surgery.
- **Psychological adaptation**: Achieve emotional stability with HAMA and HAMD in mild or normal range; improved sleep quality (PSQI <8).
- **Social participation**: Resume basic social roles and interactions within family/community.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 Medical and Surgical Coordination
- **Infection control**: Continue targeted antibiotic and antifungal therapy per culture results; coordinate with surgical and infectious disease teams.
- **Wound management**: Daily sterile dressing changes; consider negative pressure wound therapy if indicated; protect stoma with specialized appliances to prevent contamination.
- **Nutritional support**: Dietitian-guided enteral nutrition (via oral or tube feeding) or parenteral nutrition; protein 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day; monitor electrolytes and fluid balance.
- **Hypertension control**: Continue antihypertensive therapy; monitor BP regularly.

### 2.2 Physical Therapy
- **Positioning and postural management**: Frequent repositioning to prevent pressure injuries; semi-recumbent positioning to aid breathing and wound drainage.
- **Respiratory therapy**:  
  - Incentive spirometry, deep breathing exercises, and airway clearance techniques to improve pulmonary function and reduce infection risk.
  - Chest physiotherapy as tolerated, avoiding excessive abdominal strain.
- **Early mobilization**:  
  - Begin with passive and active-assisted ROM exercises for all limbs.
  - Bedside sitting training with gradual increase in duration.
  - Progressive resistance exercises for upper and lower limbs, especially left lower limb, aiming to improve muscle strength by ≥1 grade.
- **Balance training**: Initiate static sitting balance training with trunk support; progress to dynamic sitting.

### 2.3 Occupational Therapy
- **ADL training**:  
  - Practice feeding, grooming, and upper body dressing in bed or bedside chair.
  - Use adaptive devices as needed to compensate for weakness and limited endurance.
- **Energy conservation techniques**: Educate patient on pacing activities, rest breaks, and optimal body mechanics.

### 2.4 Pain Management
- **Pharmacologic**: Coordinate with medical team for multimodal analgesia (acetaminophen, NSAIDs if not contraindicated, low-dose opioids if necessary).
- **Non-pharmacologic**: Gentle massage (avoiding wound area), relaxation techniques, heat/cold therapy as appropriate.

### 2.5 Psychological Support
- **Counseling**: Regular sessions with psychologist or psychiatric liaison for anxiety and depression.
- **Coping skills training**: Teach relaxation breathing, guided imagery, and self-affirmation exercises.
- **Family involvement**: Educate family on supportive communication and assisting with rehabilitation.

### 2.6 Sleep Management
- **Sleep hygiene**: Maintain consistent sleep–wake schedule, reduce nighttime disturbances, optimize ward environment (light, noise).
- **Adjunct measures**: Relaxation exercises before bedtime; consider short-term pharmacological aids if non-drug measures insufficient.

### 2.7 Education and Caregiver Training
- **Stoma care**: Educate patient/family on stoma appliance change, skin protection, and monitoring for complications.
- **Infection prevention**: Teach hand hygiene, wound observation, and early reporting of changes.
- **Home preparation**: Plan for safe environment and needed assistive devices upon discharge.

### 2.8 Monitoring and Re-evaluation
- **Weekly functional reassessment**: Muscle strength, balance, MBI, pain, emotional status.
- **Nutritional and medical monitoring**: Weight, laboratory parameters, wound status.
- **Adjust rehabilitation plan**: Modify intensity and focus according to recovery progress and surgical needs.
