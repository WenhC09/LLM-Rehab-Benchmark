### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

*   **Short-term Goals:** Improve gastrointestinal function, alleviate abdominal pain, enhance limb muscle strength and cardiopulmonary endurance, and ameliorate anxiety and depression.
*   **Long-term Goals:** Restore the patient's ability for activities of daily living (ADLs) and improve social participation.

### 2. Therapeutic Interventions

*   **Gastrointestinal Function Rehabilitation:**
    1.  **Visceral Manipulation:**
        *   Apply a combination of direct and indirect techniques to release organs with reduced mobility, including the stomach, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, cecum, duodenum, and rectum.
        *   For the postoperatively restricted stomach, employ relaxation techniques to reduce tension in the lesser omentum and gastric cardia, combined with stretching, direct, and indirect techniques to enhance gastric body mobility.
        *   Finally, apply strengthening techniques to all aforementioned organs to restore their normal rhythmic motion, promoting gastric emptying, intestinal peristalsis, digestion, and defecation.
    2.  **Gum Chewing Instruction:** Instruct the patient in gum chewing. Utilizing the "sham feeding" principle, this stimulates neuro-reflexive activity to promote digestive secretion secretion, enhance intestinal peristaltic capacity, and aid gastrointestinal functional recovery.

*   **Cardiopulmonary Function and Muscle Strength Rehabilitation:**
    1.  **Cardiopulmonary Manipulation:** Employ direct and indirect techniques to improve mobility of the lungs and heart, which exhibit reduced mobility, followed by strengthening techniques to restore their rhythmic motion.
    2.  **Diaphragmatic Breathing Training:** Instruct the patient in diaphragmatic breathing to increase respiratory depth, improve cardiopulmonary endurance, and concurrently promote gastrointestinal peristalsis.
    3.  **Limb and Core Muscle Strength Rehabilitation:**
        *   **Upper Limb Training:** Includes upper limb elevation, abduction, adduction, elbow flexion, and elbow extension.
        *   **Lower Limb Training:** Includes leg raises and ankle pumps.
        *   **Core Training:** Includes glute bridges and child's pose.
        *   **Training Parameters:** Hold each exercise for 10 seconds, perform 10 repetitions per set, complete 1-2 sets per session, twice daily.
        *   **Medium-Frequency Electrical Stimulation (MFES):** Apply MFES to the limbs. Electrical current induces muscle contraction and relaxation, stimulating nerve endings to generate feedback, thereby regulating nerve conduction and muscular tissue excitability.
    4.  **Treatment Precautions:**
        *   Due to the presence of abdominal wall defect and exudate, strictly control intra-abdominal pressure and muscle tension during training to prevent wound dehiscence.
        *   Given the patient's physical debility, exercise intensity must be tolerable. Continuously monitor vital signs fluctuations. Limit single treatment session duration to 15-30 minutes, incorporating rest periods as needed.

*   **Psychological Support:**
    *   Provide psychological counseling for the patient and family members experiencing anxiety, aiding in rebuilding confidence for recovery and improving treatment compliance.
