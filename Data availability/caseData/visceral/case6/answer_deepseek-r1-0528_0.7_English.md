# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (1-4 weeks):
- Achieve independent bed mobility with minimal assistance
- Maintain full passive range of motion in all joints
- Reduce pain levels (VAS ≤3)
- Improve sitting balance to Level 1 (static sitting with support)
- Prevent respiratory complications through pulmonary hygiene
- Initiate nutritional rehabilitation for AGI Grade II
- Establish basic ADL independence in bed-level activities (feeding, upper body hygiene)

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve independent transfers and ambulation with assistive devices
- Restore lower limb strength to ≥4/5 bilaterally
- Attain modified independence in ADLs (MBI ≥60)
- Resolve abdominal wall defects through staged surgical reconstruction
- Improve cardiopulmonary endurance for functional activities
- Reduce anxiety/depression scores by ≥50% (HAMA ≤35, HAMD ≤33)
- Achieve upright tolerance for ≥30 minutes

## 2. Treatment Methods

### **Physical Therapy**
- **Positioning protocol**: 30° semi-recumbent positioning to reduce abdominal pressure while preventing pulmonary complications
- **Bed mobility training**: Log-roll technique with abdominal splinting
- **Passive/Active-Assisted ROM**: Full-body daily sessions with emphasis on left lower extremity (ankle pumps, quad sets)
- **Strength training**: Progressive resistance exercises for upper extremities (starting with 1-2 lb weights), isometric gluteal sets
- **Balance training**: Supported sitting balance activities on edge-of-bed (initially with 50% support)
- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Incentive spirometry q2h, postural drainage with percussion (avoiding abdominal wound)

### **Occupational Therapy**
- **ADL adaptation**: Training in one-handed self-care techniques, stoma care simulation
- **Energy conservation**: Activity pacing education with graded task analysis
- **Upper extremity function**: Light functional activities (reaching, grasping) at 60° incline
- **Cognitive-behavioral approaches**: Relaxation training for pain/anxiety management

### **Nutritional Rehabilitation**
- Progressive oral intake protocol guided by AGI Grade II parameters
- Macronutrient-focused supplementation (1.5g protein/kg/day)
- Hydration schedule with electrolyte monitoring

### **Wound Management**
- Coordinate with surgical team for negative pressure wound therapy
- Positioning education to minimize stoma contamination
- Edema control techniques for periwound area

### **Neuromuscular Re-education**
- Proprioceptive training for left lower extremity
- Gait preparation exercises (weight shifting in seated position)
- Spasticity management for left-sided hyperreflexia

### **Psychosocial Support**
- Daily brief psychotherapy sessions (supportive therapy model)
- Sleep hygiene protocol implementation
- Family education on frailty management (CFS=8)

### **Pain Management**
- Multimodal approach: TENS for non-abdominal regions, heat therapy for extremities
- Activity modification training to avoid VAS spikes
- Pharmacological coordination for breakthrough pain

### **Cardiopulmonary Management**
- Graded upright tolerance program (starting at 15° incline)
- Diaphragmatic breathing retraining
- Oxygen saturation monitoring during all activities

### **Precautions & Monitoring**
- Strict abdominal protection during all interventions (no Valsalva, limited trunk flexion)
- Vital sign monitoring pre/post therapy (BP, HR, RR)
- Daily wound assessment for signs of infection
- Progressive overload principle with 48-hour recovery windows
- Fall prevention protocol with bed alarms and low bed
