# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (1–4 weeks):
- Reduce pain (VAS score <3).
- Improve sitting balance to grade 1.
- Enhance upper limb muscle strength to grade 4+ bilaterally.
- Increase Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score to 30 points for improved ADL independence.
- Stabilize gastrointestinal function (AGI grade I or better, bowel sound score ≥2).
- Improve sleep quality (PSQI score <12).
- Reduce anxiety and depression (HAMA and HAMD scores <50).

### Long-term Goals (4–12 weeks):
- Achieve standing balance grade 1 and initiate assisted ambulation.
- Improve lower limb muscle strength to grade 4 bilaterally.
- Increase MBI score to 50 points for partial independence in ADLs.
- Optimize gastrointestinal function to normal (AGI grade 0, regular stoma output).
- Enhance sleep quality (PSQI score <7).
- Reduce frailty (CFS score ≤6).
- Improve emotional status (HAMA and HAMD scores <30).
- Promote limited social participation through group activities or family interaction.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### a. Pain Management
- **Pharmacological Support**: Coordinate with primary team for analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen or low-dose opioids) to manage abdominal and wound-related pain, ensuring compatibility with hypertension and gastrointestinal status.
- **Non-pharmacological Interventions**:
  - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) over non-infected areas of the abdomen, 20 minutes daily, to reduce VAS score.
  - Positioning techniques: Elevate head of bed 30–45° to reduce intra-abdominal pressure and pain, with frequent repositioning every 2 hours to prevent pressure injuries.

### b. Wound and Stoma Care
- **Wound Management**: Collaborate with surgical team for regular dressing changes using antimicrobial dressings (e.g., silver-impregnated) to address purulent discharge and infection. Ensure stoma isolation with barrier products to prevent further contamination.
- **Stoma Training**: Educate patient and caregivers on stoma care, including pouch management and skin protection, to promote independence and reduce infection risk. Daily sessions with enterostomal therapist for 30 minutes.

### c. Physical Therapy
- **Muscle Strengthening**:
  - Upper limbs: Active-assisted range of motion (ROM) exercises for shoulders and elbows, 3 sets of 10 repetitions daily. Progress to resistance bands (light resistance) for biceps and triceps as tolerated.
  - Lower limbs: Passive ROM for hips and knees, transitioning to active-assisted exercises for left lower limb, 3 sets of 10 repetitions daily. Use ankle weights (0.5 kg) for quadriceps strengthening if tolerated.
- **Balance Training**:
  - Bedside sitting exercises with therapist support, 10–15 minutes twice daily, focusing on trunk control and posture.
  - Progress to seated weight-shifting exercises by week 3 if sitting balance improves.
- **Transfer Training**: Bed-to-chair transfers with maximal assistance, using slide boards to minimize abdominal strain, 2–3 sessions daily.

### d. Occupational Therapy- **ADL Training**: Focus self-feeding and upper body dressing with adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled utensils, button hooks). 30-minute sessions daily to improve MBI score.
- **Energy Conservation Techniques**: Teach pacing and prioritization of tasks to reduce fatigue during ADLs, integrated into daily therapy.

### e. Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation
- **Breathing Exercises**: Diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing, 10 minutes three times daily, to improve oxygenation and reduce tachypnea.
- **Incentive Spirometry**: 10 breaths per session, 4 times daily, to enhance lung expansion and manage pleural effusion.
- **Graded Activity**: Initiate low-intensity upper limb movements in bed (e.g., arm circles), 5–10 minutes twice daily, to improve cardiopulmonary endurance without exacerbating abdominal issues.

### f. Gastrointestinal Function Optimization
- **Nutritional Support**: Collaborate with dietitian for enteral feeding plan (high-protein, low-residue formula) to address weight loss and support wound healing, with gradual reintroduction of oral intake as tolerated.
- **Bowel Management**: Monitor stoma output and administer prescribed probiotics or motility agents to improve bowel sound score and AGI grade, as per gastroenterology input.

### g. Psychological and Sleep Interventions
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Weekly 30-minute sessions with a psychologist to address anxiety (HAMA) and depression (HAMD), focusing on coping strategies for chronic illness.
- **Sleep Hygiene**: Implement structured sleep schedule, dim lighting, and noise reduction in the evening. Guided relaxation techniques (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation) for 15 minutes before bedtime to improve PSQI score.
- **Social Support**: Encourage family visits and brief social interactions to reduce isolation, coordinated with nursing staff.

### h. Monitoring and Safety
- **Vital Signs Monitoring**: Daily assessment of temperature, pulse, and blood pressure to detect infection or cardiovascular instability early.
- **Fall Prevention**: Use bed rails and ensure assistance during transfers due to poor balance and limb weakness.
- **Infection Control**: Strict hand hygiene and barrier precautions during therapy to prevent worsening of abdominal or pulmonary infections.

### i. Caregiver Education
- Train family or caregivers in assisting with transfers, stoma care, and ADL tasks to support patient recovery and transition to home-based care. Weekly 1-hour sessions with rehabilitation nurse.

### j. Frequency and Duration
- Therapy sessions: 30–45 minutes daily for physical and occupational therapy, split into morning and afternoon to prevent fatigue.
- Total program duration: Initial 4 weeks, with reassessment for progression to outpatient or home-based rehabilitation based on functional gains.
