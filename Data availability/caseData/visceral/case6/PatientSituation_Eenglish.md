# Patient Case Information

## I. Case Summary

*   **Patient Demographics**: Female, 70 years old.  
*   **Chief Complaint**: Purulent discharge from wound with abdominal wall defect for over 1 month, following colon perforation surgery 2 months ago.  
*   **History of Present Illness**: Approximately 2 months ago (November 12, 2023), due to abdominal pain, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy in the emergency department. Intraoperatively, sigmoid colon perforation was found, and partial sigmoidectomy with descending colostomy was performed (postoperative pathology report showed no tumor in the colon). Postoperatively, the patient was successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation and extubated, with smooth bowel movements from the stoma, and gradually resumed oral intake. However, after transfer to the general ward, the close proximity of the stoma to the midline abdominal incision caused contamination of the lower incision, leading to liquefactive necrosis of subcutaneous tissue and formation of a large abdominal wall defect approximately 15cm × 10cm. The stoma retracted and became isolated within the defective abdominal wall. After aggressive dressing changes at the local hospital with unsatisfactory results, intestinal fistula could not be ruled out. For further treatment, the patient was transferred to our hospital and admitted with diagnoses of "abdominal wall defect, abdominal wall infection, intra-abdominal infection". On admission, the patient had weakness in all four limbs, inability to cooperate with lifting, and inability to stand or walk independently. Most activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, dressing, transferring, toileting, and bathing required assistance. Since onset, the patient has had poor mental status and sleep, no oral intake, reduced flatus and defecation, with recent weight loss of approximately 5kg.  
*   **Past Medical History**: History of hypertension, controlled with oral medication. Denies history of chronic bronchitis, asthma, hepatitis, tuberculosis, malaria, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, or mental disorders. No history of other surgeries, trauma, or blood transfusion. No food or drug allergies. Vaccination history unknown.  

## II. Physical Examination and Functional Assessment

*   **General Condition**: Well-developed, well-nourished, appears in pain, natural expression, forced position, poor consciousness, suboptimal cooperation with examination.  
*   **Skin and Mucous Membranes**: Normal skin and mucous membranes throughout, no jaundice, rash, subcutaneous hemorrhage, nodules, or scars. Hair distribution uniform, no edema, palmar erythema, or spider angiomas. No enlargement or tenderness of superficial lymph nodes.  
*   **Head, Face, Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Neck**: Head without deformity, eyelids without edema, bilateral pupils equal and round, approximately 3mm in diameter, normal light reflex. Lips without cyanosis, oral mucosa dry. Neck supple, no resistance, trachea midline.  
*   **Chest**: Normal chest configuration without deformity. Tachypnea, coarse breath sounds bilaterally, with dry and moist rales and pleural friction rubs audible in both lungs. Heart rate 120 beats/min, regular rhythm, no murmurs heard in any valve area.  
*   **Abdomen**: Obvious surgical scars, midline abdominal wall defect with purulent bloody discharge. Stoma located within the abdominal wall defect. Abdomen slightly firm.  
*   **Neurological and Musculoskeletal**:  
    *   **Manual Muscle Testing**: Proximal upper limb muscle strength grade 4, distal upper limb grade 4; proximal left lower limb grade 3, distal left lower limb grade 3.  
    *   **Range of Motion**: Passive joint range of motion normal.  
    *   **Sensation**: Symmetric pinprick, light touch, and vibration sense bilaterally without reduction, joint position sense normal.  
    *   **Reflexes**: Left biceps reflex, triceps reflex, brachioradialis reflex (+++). Left patellar reflex, Achilles reflex (+++).  
    *   **Pathological Signs**: Left ankle clonus (+), left Hoffmann sign (+), left Babinski sign (+).  

## III. Auxiliary Examinations

*   **Chest CT (External Hospital)**: Left closed thoracic drainage in place, right pleural effusion, pulmonary infection. Culture showed fungal spores and Escherichia coli.  
*   **Abdominal CT (Our Hospital)**: Intra-abdominal fluid, peritonitis.

    6.  Intra-abdominal fluid  
    7.  Hypertension stage 3 (high risk)  
    8.  Colostomy status  
*   **Functional Diagnoses**:  
    1.  Impaired gastrointestinal function  
    2.  Pain  
    3.  Limb mobility impairment  
    4.  Reduced cardiopulmonary endurance  
    5.  Limited activities of daily living (ADL) ability  
    6.  Decreased social participation ability
