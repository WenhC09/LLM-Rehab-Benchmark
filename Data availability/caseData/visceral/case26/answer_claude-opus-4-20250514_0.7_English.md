### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

1. **Rehabilitation Goals:**
   - **Short-term goals:**
     - Improve respiratory function and reduce reliance on non-invasive ventilation.
     - Enhance muscle strength in upper and lower limbs, aiming for at least MRC score improvement by 1 point in major muscle groups.
     - Increase patient awareness and engagement in rehabilitation activities.
     - Stabilize vital signs and manage electrolyte imbalances.

   - **Long-term goals:**
     - Achieve independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) with a Modified Barthel Index score improvement to at least 40.
     - Restore cardiopulmonary function to support safe ambulation and functional mobility.
     - Facilitate a gradual return to pre-transplant activity levels, including light physical activities and self-care.

2. **Treatment Methods:**
   - **Respiratory Rehabilitation:**
     - Implement incentive spirometry and deep breathing exercises to improve lung expansion and oxygenation.
     - Gradual weaning from non-invasive ventilation as respiratory function improves.

   - **Physical Therapy:**
     - Initiate passive range of motion exercises for all extremities to prevent contractures and maintain joint mobility.
     - Progress to active-assisted and active exercises as tolerated, focusing on strengthening major muscle groups (e.g., shoulder, hip, knee).
     - Incorporate functional training to improve balance and coordination, including sit-to-stand exercises and gait training with assistance.

   - **Occupational Therapy:**
     - Assess and adapt the environment to facilitate participation in ADLs.
     - Provide training in self-care tasks, gradually increasing complexity as strength and endurance improve.

   - **Nutritional Support:**
     - Collaborate with a dietitian to ensure adequate caloric and protein intake to support recovery and muscle rebuilding.
     - Monitor fluid and electrolyte balance closely, adjusting dietary intake as needed.

   - **Multidisciplinary Approach:**
     - Regular consultations with cardiology, nephrology, and nutrition specialists to address ongoing medical issues and optimize overall health.
     - Psychological support to address mental health and emotional well-being, considering the patient's history of severe illness and hospitalization.

   - **Monitoring and Evaluation:**
     - Regularly assess vital signs, muscle strength, and functional status to adjust the rehabilitation plan as needed.
     - Set weekly goals and review progress with the rehabilitation team to ensure alignment with patient recovery objectives.
