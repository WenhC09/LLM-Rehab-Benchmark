### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan  

#### 1. Rehabilitation Goals  
**Short-term Goals (1-4 weeks):**  
- Stabilize cardiopulmonary function: Maintain SpO₂ ≥95% during ventilator weaning.  
- Prevent complications: Zero incidence of pressure ulcers, pneumonia, or deep vein thrombosis.  
- Improve bed mobility: Achieve independent rolling and bridging in bed within 3 weeks.  
- Initiate muscle re-education: Increase MRC sum score to 35+ through passive/active-assisted exercises.  
- Enhance respiratory function: Increase chest expansion to ≥3 cm bilaterally.  

**Long-term Goals (3-6 months):**  
- Achieve ventilator independence and ambulate 100m with assistive device.  
- Restore ADL independence: Modified Barthel Index ≥75 (modified independence).  
- Normalize muscle strength: MRC ≥4 in all major limb muscle groups.  
- Optimize transplant graft function: Sustain resting HR <100 bpm and BP 110-130/70-80 mmHg.  

#### 2. Treatment Methods  
**Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation:**  
- *Ventilator Weaning Protocol:*  
  - Daily T-piece trials (start 5min 4x/day → ↑30min)  
  - Incentive spirometry hourly (target 15mL/kg volume)  
  - Pursed-lip breathing + diaphragmatic training (5min 4x/day)  
- *Aerobic Conditioning:*  
  - Bedside cycle ergometer (passive → active-assisted): 5min 2x/day, RPE ≤11  
  - Seated marching (supported): 2min hourly  

**Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation:**  
- *Strength Training:*  
  - NMES (quadriceps/hamstrings): 15Hz, 10s on/30s off, 20min BID  
  - Progressive resisted exercise:  
    - Week 1-2: Passive ROM all joints (10 reps BID)  
    - Week 3-4: Active-assisted ROM (gravity-eliminated planes)  
- *Edema Management:*  
  - Limb elevation + intermittent pneumatic compression (30min QID)  
  - Manual lymphatic drainage (calf→thigh, 10min/side TID)  

**Functional Mobility Training:**  
- *Bed Mobility:*  
  - Log-rolling training (with sternal precautions): 5 reps hourly  
  - Bridge-to-sit transfers: Max assist → min assist (3x/day)  
- *Sitting Balance:*  
  - Edge-of-bed sitting (supported): 5min → 30min (↑5min/day)  
  - Weight shifts (anterior/posterior): 2min 5x/day  

**Multisystem Management:**  
- *GI/Renal Precautions:*  
  - Abdominal binder during mobilization  
  - CVVHDF-coordinated fluid balance monitoring (pre/post session weights)  
- *Neurocognitive Training:*  
  - Orientation exercises (person/place/time) 5x/day  
  - Dual-task activities (e.g., counting during ankle pumps)  

**Safety & Monitoring Parameters:**  
- Terminate activity if:  
  - HR >130 bpm or ↑>20 bpm from baseline  
  - SpO₂ <90% for >1min  
  - SBP >160/100 or <90/60 mmHg  
  - Bleeding (melena/hematochezia)  
- Daily tracking:  
  - MRC muscle strength (key groups)  
  - Chest expansion measurement  
  - Fluid intake/output balance  

**Nutritional Support:**  
- Protein intake: 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day (monitor BUN/Cr)  
- Sodium restriction: <2g/day (transplant protocol)  
- Vitamin D/C supplementation (ICU-AW protocol)  

*Note: All interventions require coordination with transplant team, nephrology, and critical care for CVVHDF scheduling and immunosuppression monitoring.*
