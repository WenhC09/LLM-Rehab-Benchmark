# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (1-4 weeks):
- **Improve Cardiopulmonary Function**: Enhance oxygen saturation stability and reduce reliance on non-invasive ventilation support to achieve spontaneous breathing with minimal supplemental oxygen.
- **Increase Muscle Strength**: Improve MRC scores by at least 1 grade in major muscle groups to enhance bed mobility and reduce ICU-acquired weakness.
- **Enhance Bedside Mobility**: Achieve partial independence in basic transfers (e.g., bed to chair) with minimal assistance, targeting a Modified Barthel Index score increase to 20-30.
- **Stize Gastrointestinal Function**: Reduce episodes of hematochezia and improve tolerance to enteral nutrition to support recovery.
- **Prevent Complications**: Minimize risks of pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and secondary infections through positioning and early mobilization.

### Long-term Goals (1-3 months):
- **Optimize Cardiopulmonary Endurance**: Achieve independent ambulation for short distances (10-20 meters) with stable vital signs and no supplemental oxygen.
- **Restore Functional Strength**: Attain MRC scores of Grade 4 or higher in major muscle groups to support activities of daily living (ADL).
- **Improve ADL Independence**: Reach a Modified Barthel Index score of 50-70, enabling moderate independence in self-care tasks (e.g., feeding, grooming).
- **Enhance Quality of Life**: Return to home environment with outpatient rehabilitation support, managing post-transplant care and preventing rejection or complications.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation
- **Breathing Exercises**: Initiate diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing exercises for 10-15 minutes, 3-4 times daily, to improve chest expansion and respiratory efficiency. Monitor oxygen saturation and heart rate during sessions to ensure stability (target SpO2 >95%, HR <120 bpm).
- **Non-Invasive Ventilation Weaning**: Gradually reduce ventilator support under respiratory therapist supervision, aiming for 1-2 hours of spontaneous breathing trials daily, progressing based on patient tolerance and arterial blood gas results.
- **Aerobic Conditioning**: Begin with bedside passive range of motion (ROM) transitioning to active-assisted ROM exercises for 10-15 minutes twice daily, focusing on upper and lower limbs to improve circulation and prevent deconditioning.

### Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation
- **Progressive Resistance Training**: Implement low-intensity resistance exercises using body weight or light resistance bands (0.5-1 kg) for major muscle groups (shoulder abductors, elbow flexors, hip flexors, knee extensors). Perform 8-10 repetitions, 2 sets, 3 times per week, with rest days to prevent fatigue. Adjust based on MRC score improvements.
- **Passive and Active-Assisted ROM**: Conduct daily sessions for all major joints (shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles) to maintain joint mobility and prevent contractures. Each joint should undergo 10-15 repetitions per session, performed by a physical therapist.
- **Positioning and Postural Training**: Use proper positioning (semi-Fowler’s position at 30-45 degrees) to optimize cardiopulmonary function and reduce lower limb edema. Reposition every 2 hours to prevent pressure ulcers, incorporating foam cushions or air mattresses.

### Functional Training
- **Bedside Mobility Training**: Initiate assisted transfers (bed to chair) using a sliding board or minimal assistance, 1-2 times daily, progressing to sit-to-stand exercises as tolerated. Target 3-5 repetitions per session, monitoring for orthostatic hypotension.
- **ADL Training**: Focus on upper limb exercises to improve self-feeding and grooming, using adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled utensils) if needed. Occupational therapist to guide 10-15 minute sessions daily, tailored to patient’s Modified Barthel Index score.

### Gastrointestinal and Nutritional Support
- **Enteral Nutrition Monitoring**: Collaborate with a dietitian to ensure gradual reintroduction of enteral feeding, starting with low-volume, high-nutrient feeds (e.g., 20-30 mL/hour) to prevent refeeding syndrome. Monitor for hematochezia and adjust feeding rate accordingly.
- **Abdominal Massage**: Perform gentle abdominal massage for 5-10 minutes daily to promote gastrointestinal motility, avoiding areas of tenderness or active bleeding.

### Complication Prevention
- **DVT Prophylaxis**: Apply graduated compression stockings and perform ankle pump exercises (10-15 repetitions, 3 times daily) to enhance venous return. Monitor for signs of DVT (e.g., unilateral swelling, calf pain).
- **Pressure Ulcer Prevention**: Use pressure-relieving mattresses and conduct skin assessments every shift. Educate nursing staff on proper turning schedules.
- **Infection Control**: Ensure strict adherence to aseptic techniques during all interventions, given the patient’s history of pneumonia and immunosuppression post-transplant.

### Monitoring and Progression
- **Weekly Assessments**: Re-evaluate MRC scores, Modified Barthel Index, and vital signs weekly to adjust exercise intensity and goals. Monitor for signs of transplant rejection (e.g., fever, fatigue, tachycardia) and coordinate with the transplant team.
- **Multidisciplinary Collaboration**: Regular consultations with cardiologists, nephrologists, and hepatologists to address hepatic and renal failure, ensuring rehabilitation aligns with medical management (e.g., immunosuppression, hemodialysis schedule).
- **Patient and Family Education**: Provide education on post-transplant care, including medication adherence, signs of complications, and the importance of rehabilitation. Involve family in mobility training to support home transition.

### Contraindications and Precautions
- Avoid high-intensity exercises or prolonged sessions due to risk of cardiopulmonary overload (HR >120 bpm or SpO2 <95%).
- Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding during mobility training; pause exercises if hematochezia recurs.
- Limit interventions during periods of electrolyte imbalance or unstable vital signs until medically stabilized.
