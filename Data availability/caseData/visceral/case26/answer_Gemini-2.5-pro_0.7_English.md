### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-term goals (Within 2 weeks, ICU phase):
1.  **Respiratory:** Successfully wean from non-invasive ventilation. Achieve a stable, independent breathing pattern with a respiratory rate below 25/min at rest. Increase chest expansion to >3 cm. Maintain clear airways and prevent postoperative pulmonary complications.
2.  **Motor:**
    *   Prevent joint contractures and pressure injuries through regular passive range of motion and optimal bed positioning.
    *   Improve global muscle strength from MRC sum score of 26 to >36. Specifically, achieve at least Grade 3 (movement against gravity) in key antigravity muscles (e.g., elbow flexors, wrist extensors, knee extensors).
3.  **Functional Mobility:** Tolerate sitting at the edge of the bed with minimal to moderate assistance for at least 15 minutes, twice daily, while maintaining hemodynamic stability.
4.  **Activities of Daily Living:** Participate actively in basic self-care tasks such as facial grooming and feeding with setup and assistance.
5.  **Patient Education:** Ensure patient and family understand and can verbalize sternal precautions and the rationale for early rehabilitation.

#### Long-term goals (Within 3-6 months, post-discharge):
1.  **Cardiopulmonary:** Achieve a 6-Minute Walk Test distance appropriate for age and new cardiac status, demonstrating good cardiovascular endurance. Be independent of supplemental oxygen under all conditions.
2.  **Motor:** Achieve muscle strength of at least Grade 4 in all major muscle groups of both upper and lower extremities.
3.  **Functional Mobility:** Achieve independent ambulation on level surfaces, initially with an assistive device (e.g., walker) and progressing to independence without a device. Independently and safely navigate stairs.
4.  **Activities of Daily Living:** Achieve independence (Modified Barthel Index score >90) in all basic ADLs.
5.  **Quality of Life:** Return to community living and participation in desired social and recreational activities.

### 2. Treatment Methods

**General Principles:**
*   All interventions will be performed with continuous monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.
*   Strict adherence to **sternal precautions** for a minimum of 6-8 weeks: no pushing, pulling, or lifting more than 5-10 lbs; no bilateral shoulder flexion or abduction beyond 90 degrees; no reaching behind the back.
*   Close collaboration with the ICU and cardiac surgery teams to coordinate care, especially regarding ventilator weaning, fluid status, and medication management.

#### A. Respiratory Rehabilitation
1.  **Ventilator Weaning Support:** Coordinate with the ICU team. Use positioning (upright sitting) to optimize diaphragmatic excursion and ventilation-perfusion matching.
2.  **Breathing Control Techniques:**
    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing:** Manual cues and verbal instruction to encourage deeper, more efficient breathing and reduce the use of accessory muscles.
    *   **Pursed-Lip Breathing:** To manage dyspnea, slow respiratory rate, and improve gas exchange.
3.  **Airway Clearance:**
    *   **Assisted Coughing/Huffing:** Provide manual support (splinting the sternum with a pillow) during coughing to improve effectiveness and minimize pain.
    *   **Active Cycle of Breathing Technique (ACBT):** To be initiated as patient tolerance improves.
4.  **Respiratory Muscle Training:**
    *   Initiate Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) with a threshold device at a low intensity (e.g., 30% of Maximal Inspiratory Pressure) once the patient is extubated and stable.

#### B. Musculoskeletal and Neuromuscular Rehabilitation
1.  **Positioning:** Implement a 2-hour turning schedule. Use pillows and wedges to maintain neutral joint alignment, offload bony prominences, and prevent contractures (especially foot drop via positioning or splints).
2.  **Range of Motion Exercises:**
    *   **Passive Range of Motion (PROM):** For all extremities, 2-3 times daily, to maintain joint mobility.
    *   **Active-Assisted Range of Motion (AAROM):** For all muscle groups with strength < Grade 3.
    *   **Active Range of Motion (AROM):** For muscle groups with strength â‰¥ Grade 3, initially in gravity-eliminated positions.
3.  **Strengthening Program:**
    *   **Isometric Exercises:** Initiate immediately for major muscle groups (quadriceps, gluteals, abdominals with caution) to activate muscles without joint movement.
    *   **Progressive Resistive Exercises:** Once strength reaches Grade 3, introduce light resistance (e.g., therapy bands) for lower extremities and trunk. Upper extremity resistance will be deferred per sternal precautions.
    *   **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES):** Apply to large, weak muscle groups, particularly the quadriceps and gluteals, for 30-60 minutes daily to augment volitional contraction, combat atrophy, and improve muscle recruitment.

#### C. Early Mobilization and Functional Training
1.  **Bed Mobility:** Train in rolling, bridging, and moving up/down in bed with assistance, using log-rolling techniques to protect the sternum.
2.  **Sitting Progression:**
    *   Start with elevating the head of the bed to 30-45 degrees, progressing as tolerated.
    *   Advance to sitting on the edge of the bed ("dangling") with assistance. Start with short durations (5 minutes) and increase as tolerated, monitoring for orthostatic hypotension.
3.  **Transfer Training:**
    *   Once sitting tolerance is established, begin sit-to-stand transfers, initially with a tilt table or maximal assistance from two personnel to ensure safety and adherence to sternal precautions.
4.  **ADL Retraining:**
    *   Integrate simple ADLs into therapy sessions.
    *   Begin with bed-level activities: using an electric razor, brushing teeth, washing face.
    *   Emphasize energy conservation principles and task simplification.

#### D. Patient and Family Education
1.  Provide clear, repeated instruction on sternal precautions.
2.  Educate on the nature of ICU-AW and the importance of active patient participation for recovery.
3.  Discuss the rehabilitation plan, goals, and expected progression to manage expectations and foster motivation.
4.  Provide psychological support and encouragement, acknowledging the magnitude of the recent surgery and critical illness.
