# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

*   **Short-term Goals:**
    *   **Postoperative Week 1:** Successful weaning from mechanical ventilation. Maintain basic mobility of all four limbs.
    *   **Postoperative Week 2:** Improve spontaneous sputum expectoration ability to prevent pulmonary infection. Alleviate gastrointestinal dysfunction symptoms (abdominal distension, vomiting). Achieve moderate dependence level in Activities of Daily Living (ADL), including independent feeding, personal hygiene, and grooming.
    *   **Postoperative Week 4:** Enhance muscle strength in all four limbs to tolerate resistance training. Improve bed mobility and transfer ability to achieve bedside standing. Achieve minimal dependence level in ADL.

*   **Long-term Goal:**
    *   Achieve complete independence in Activities of Daily Living and reintegrate into normal social life.

### 2. Treatment Methods

*   **Physical Therapy**
    *   **Positioning Adaptation Training:**
        *   **Pre-weaning:** Elevate head of bed to 15°. Maintain limbs in functional positions.
        *   **Early Post-weaning:** Initiate semi-recumbent sitting training starting at 30° elevation, progressively increasing to 45°, 60°, and 90°. Duration: 15-30 minutes per session. Perform 45° lateral positioning every 2 hours to prevent pressure ulcers.
        *   **Later Stage:** Implement bedside sitting-to-standing training. Frequency: 3 times daily. Duration: 15-30 minutes per session.
    *   **Pulmonary Rehabilitation:**
        *   **Pre-weaning:** Position patient supine with shoulders abducted and elbows flexed to expand thoracic cage. Perform manual assistance during expiration in Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV) mode to train accessory inspiratory muscles. Frequency: Twice daily. Duration: 20 minutes per session.
        *   **Postoperative Week 1:** Instruct patient in diaphragmatic breathing combined with pursed-lip breathing training. Gradually transition inspiration/expiration ratio from 1:1 to 1:3. Frequency: Twice daily. Duration: 20 minutes per session. Implement Oscillating Positive Expiratory Pressure (OPEP) device training. Frequency: 5 times daily. Duration: 30 seconds per session. Supplement with percussion and postural drainage. Frequency: 5 times daily. Duration: 30 seconds per session.
        *   **Postoperative Week 2:** Conduct balloon-blowing exercises in 90° semi-recumbent position to strengthen respiratory muscles. Frequency: 6-10 times hourly. Utilize mechanical vibration for sputum clearance. Frequency: Twice daily. Duration: 10 minutes per session. Train patient in self-assisted cough technique: In sitting or forward-leaning position with hands crossed protecting sternal incision, take deep inspiration followed by forced expiration while producing /k/ sound. Frequency: 5 times daily. Duration: 30 seconds per session.
    *   **Trunk & Limb Exercise Training:**
        *   **Postoperative Week 1:** Therapist performs passive range of motion exercises for all four limbs. Implement isometric strength training for upper limb flexors and lower limb extensors. Frequency: Twice daily. Sets/Repetitions: 3 sets × 10 reps per session.
        *   **Postoperative Week 2:** Guide patient through active-assisted exercises for all four limbs coordinated with breathing. Frequency: Twice daily. Sets/Repetitions: 3 sets × 10 reps per session. Implement passive cycling using bedside cycle ergometer. Speed: 10 rpm. Frequency: Twice daily. Duration: 3 minutes per session.
        *   **Postoperative Week 4:** Apply Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) techniques ("repeated contractions" and "slow reversals") for strength training. Frequency: Twice daily. Sets/Repetitions: 3 sets × 10 reps per session. Strengthen core muscles through bridging exercises. Frequency: Twice daily. Sets/Repetitions: 3 sets × 6 reps per session. Instruct patient in bedside sitting Baduanjin exercise with musical accompaniment. Frequency: Twice daily. Duration: 5 minutes per session.
        *   **Exercise Principles:** Training intensity follows progressive overload principle. Avoid Valsalva maneuver. Strictly adhere to "bucket principle" for sternal protection: Bilateral lifting restricted to ≤10 lbs (~4.5kg), avoid overhead arm activities, limit wide bilateral arm movements, refrain from driving. Active shoulder flexion/abduction restricted to ≤90°. Monitor exercise intensity using Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale (maintain 12-14). Perform 10-minute warm-up and cool-down before/after exercise.
    *   **Gastrointestinal Function Rehabilitation:**
        *   **Abdominal Massage:** Perform rotary massage over abdomen using palm in clockwise/counterclockwise direction.
        *   **Red Light Therapy:** Apply red light therapy to abdominal region. Frequency: Twice daily. Duration: 10 minutes per session.
        *   **Acupuncture Therapy:** Select bilateral Neiguan (PC6), Zusanli (ST36), and Shangjuxu (ST37) acupoints. After needle sensation achieved, connect ipsilateral Zusanli (ST36) and Shangjuxu (ST37) to electroacupuncture device using continuous wave at 15Hz (intensity to patient tolerance). Frequency: Once daily. Duration: 30 minutes per session.

*   **Occupational Therapy**
    *   Focus intervention on Activities of Daily Living (ADL) alongside physical function recovery.
    *   Specific training includes self-care activities: Personal hygiene (washing), bedside feeding, dressing, toileting.
    *   Implement communication skills training and recreational therapy to facilitate social function restoration.

*   **Psychological Intervention**
    *   **Motivational Interviewing:** Establish rapport through open-ended questions to enhance rehabilitation motivation.
    *   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Guide patient in daily positive self-affirmation (e.g., 10 encouraging statements) to improve self-efficacy and build confidence.
    *   **Relaxation Training:** Utilize music therapy and sleep management techniques to alleviate anxiety and promote relaxation.

*   **Nutritional Intervention**
    *   **Early Phase:** Primarily parenteral nutrition.
    *   **Postoperative Week 2:** Transition to oral intake of low-fat, low-sodium pureed diet. Macronutrient distribution: Protein 20%, Fat 25%, Carbohydrate 55%.
    *   **Nutritional Supplementation:** Administer whey protein supplement within 30 minutes post-resistance training to promote muscle recovery.

*   **Home-based Rehabilitation Guidance & Follow-up**
    *   **Discharge Education:** Provide home-based cardiac rehabilitation instruction via social media platforms, re-emphasizing "bucket principle" for sternal protection.
    *   **Regular Follow-up:** Conduct assessments at 3 months and 6 months post-discharge. Evaluate limb circumference, muscle strength, 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) distance, and ADL. Adjust rehabilitation recommendations based on recovery progress.
