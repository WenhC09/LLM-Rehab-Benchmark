### Medical Record Summary

Male patient, 52 years old.

**Chief Complaint:** Recurrent chest tightness for 12 years, fever for half a month.

**Present Illness:** The patient sought medical attention at a local hospital 12 years ago for chest tightness, initially suspected as "pericardial effusion" (details unspecified). Condition progressively worsened with subsequent diagnosis of Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Heart Failure, Atrial Fibrillation, and Massive Pericardial Effusion. Multiple hospitalizations ensued with treatments including pacemaker implantation and pericardiocentesis. Approximately 20 days ago, fever developed during treatment at a local hospital (peak temperature 38.7°C), initially nocturnal and self-resolving, later becoming persistent. Anti-infective therapy proved ineffective (Moxifloxacin, Cefoperazone-Sulbactam, Meropenem). Cardiac transplantation was recommended, leading to transfer to our Emergency Department on 2021-02-22. On 2021-02-23, due to Respiratory Failure, Pulmonary Infection, Heart Failure, and Renal Insufficiency, the patient was transferred to ICU for Continuous Veno-Venous Hemodialysis (CVVH). Condition improved and transferred to Cardiology Department on 2021-02-27. On 2021-02-28, clinical deterioration occurred with massive hematochezia and decreased hemoglobin. Hemostatic agents and blood transfusion were administered, but follow-up showed unimproved hemoglobin, elevated serum creatinine, and electrolyte imbalance. The patient exhibited poor mental status, lower limb edema, slurred speech, and recurrent hematochezia. Transferred back to ICU on 2021-03-01; due to persistently rising creatinine, blood purification therapy was resumed. Multidisciplinary consultation concluded end-stage Heart Failure with concomitant Hepatic and Renal Failure, poor response to medical therapy, meeting criteria for cardiac transplantation. A suitable donor heart was matched via the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS) on 2021-03-09. On 2021-03-10, the patient underwent "Cardiac Transplantation" under general anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass. Surgery was successful; patient transferred to Cardiac Surgery ICU postoperatively. Comprehensive treatment included non-invasive ventilation support. The hospital expert panel recommended early rehabilitation intervention.

**Past Medical History:** Denies history of Hypertension, Coronary Heart Disease, or Diabetes Mellitus. No smoking or alcohol history. Denies family history of genetic disorders or malignancy.
