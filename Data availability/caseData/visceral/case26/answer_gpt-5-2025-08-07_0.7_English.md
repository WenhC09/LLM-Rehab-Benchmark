## Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks post-op)
- Maintain hemodynamic stability and prevent postoperative complications (e.g., infection, rejection, DVT, pressure sores).
- Improve pulmonary ventilation and oxygenation; reduce ventilator dependence.
- Prevent joint contractures and muscle atrophy through early mobilization.
- Gradually improve limb muscle strength (MRC score increase by ≥4 points).
- Enhance sitting balance and tolerance to upright posture.
- Maintain gastrointestinal function and nutritional status to support recovery.
- Begin retraining in basic self-care activities as tolerated.

#### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
- Achieve independent breathing without ventilator support.
- Restore sufficient cardiopulmonary endurance for independent ambulation indoors ≥100 m without significant dyspnea (Borg ≤3).
- Improve ADL ability to Modified Barthel Index ≥80 (minimal assistance or independence).
- Achieve limb muscle strength ≥Grade 4 on MRC scale.
- Establish a safe and sustainable home-based exercise program tailored to post-heart transplant needs.
- Maintain stable graft function with good adherence to medical therapy and lifestyle modifications.

### 2. Treatment Methods

#### (A) Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation
- **Monitoring:** Continuous ECG, pulse oximetry, blood pressure during early sessions; monitor heart rate, rhythm, and perceived exertion (Borg scale).
- **Respiratory therapy:**
  - Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) using threshold devices or incentive spirometry, starting with low resistance, 2–3 sessions/day.
  - Positioning: Semi-recumbent or upright to facilitate lung expansion.
  - Airway clearance techniques (assisted coughing, vibration/percussion) if secretions are present.
- **Gradual mobilization:**
  - Begin with passive range-of-motion (PROM) exercises in bed.
  - Progress to active-assisted and then active range-of-motion (AROM) as tolerated.
  - Transition to dangling at bedside, sitting in chair, and short standing sessions.
  - Low-intensity bedside marching or step training with close hemodynamic monitoring.

#### (B) Motor Function Rehabilitation
- **Early stage (ICU/bedside):**
  - PROM exercises for all major joints 2–3 times/day to prevent contractures.
  - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to major limb muscle groups to reduce atrophy.
- **Progressive strengthening:**
  - Isometric contractions advancing to isotonic exercises with minimal resistance (elastic bands/hand weights) as tolerated.
  - Emphasis on proximal muscle groups (shoulder, hip) to support functional mobility.
- **Balance training:**
  - Seated balance exercises, progressing to standing balance and weight shifting under supervision.

#### (C) ADL Training
- **Early:** Bed mobility training, sitting tolerance, grooming in bed.
- **Progression:** Transfer training (bed-to-chair), dressing, feeding, personal hygiene.
- Use adaptive devices as needed to facilitate independence.

#### (D) Nutritional Support
- Coordinate with dietitian to ensure adequate protein and caloric intake for healing and muscle rebuilding.
- Monitor for gastrointestinal tolerance and adjust feeding method (oral vs. enteral) accordingly.

#### (E) Psychological Support
- Psychological counseling to reduce anxiety, depression, and improve motivation.
- Education on lifestyle modifications post-cardiac transplantation, including medication adherence and infection prevention.

#### (F) Complication Prevention
- **DVT prophylaxis:** Lower limb active/passive exercises, compression stockings if not contraindicated.
- **Pressure ulcer prevention:** Regular repositioning every 2 hours, skin inspection.
- **Infection control:** Strict aseptic techniques; hand hygiene; mask use in high-risk areas.

#### (G) Discharge and Home Program Planning
- Gradual transition from inpatient to outpatient or home-based rehab under supervision.
- Structured home exercise regimen: low-to-moderate intensity aerobic exercise (walking, stationary cycling), resistance training, breathing exercises.
- Regular follow-up with transplant team for cardiac function, immunosuppressive drug monitoring, and rehabilitation reassessment.
