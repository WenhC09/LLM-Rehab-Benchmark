# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan  

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals  
### Short-term goals (0-4 weeks):  
- **Prevent respiratory complications:** Achieve effective cough clearance and maintain SpO₂ >92% on room air  
- **Restore basic mobility:** Achieve independent bed transfers and seated balance within 2 weeks  
- **Improve nutritional status:** Stabilize weight with BMI target >15.0 through supervised nutrition protocol  
- **Manage surgical recovery:** Maintain clean/dry abdominal incision with zero dehiscence  
- **Initiate osteoporosis protection:** Establish safe weight-bearing precautions during mobility training  

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):  
- **Achieve functional independence:** Barthel Index ≥75 points with independent ADL performance  
- **Restore ambulation capacity:** Attain household ambulation ≥100m with appropriate assistive device  
- **Optimize cardiopulmonary function:** Attain 6MWT distance >250m with stable cardiac rhythm (pacemaker-monitored)  
- **Prevent pathological fractures:** Maintain bone density through controlled weight-bearing progression  
- **Enable community reintegration:** Resume basic social activities with fatigue management strategies  

## 2. Treatment Methods  
### Phase 1: Acute Recovery (Post-op Week 1-2)  
- **Respiratory Rehabilitation**  
  - Incentive spirometry every 2 waking hours (volume target: 30% above baseline)  
  - Supported cough technique training (abdominal splinting with pillow)  
  - Postural drainage with percussion (modified for osteoporosis)  
- **Mobility Training**  
  - Bed-level exercises: Ankle pumps, gluteal sets, quad sets (5 reps/hour)  
  - Seated edge-of-bed balance training (with gait belt and 2-person assist)  
  - Progressive sitting tolerance: 15min TID → 30min BID  
- **Nutrition & Metabolic Management**  
  - High-protein oral supplements (1.5g/kg/day) + vitamin D/calcium supplementation  
  - Glycemic monitoring protocol (pre-prandial BG 100-180 mg/dL)  
  - Daily weight tracking with dietician consultation  
- **Wound & Abdominal Care**  
  - Incision protection during mobility (abdominal binder during transfers)  
  - Scar mobilization techniques (initiated post-suture removal)  

### Phase 2: Functional Restoration (Week 3-6)  
- **Progressive Mobility Program**  
  - Chair yoga for core stabilization (osteoporosis-modified poses)  
  - Supported standing training (parallel bars → front-wheel walker)  
  - Pacemaker-monitored aerobic training: Recumbent cycling (5-10min BID, RPE ≤3/10)  
- **Strength Interventions**  
  - Resistance band exercises (proximal focus: hip flexors/abductors 3x10 reps)  
  - Functional electrical stimulation for quadriceps (20min/day)  
  - Hand grip strengthening program (progressing from 50% MVC)  
- **Cardiac Precautions**  
  - Continuous ECG monitoring during exercise (target HR <100bpm)  
  - Myocarditis recovery protocol: <2METs activity until cardiac clearance  
- **ADL Re-education**  
  - Energy conservation techniques for bathing/dressing  
  - Adaptive equipment training (reacher, sock aid)  

### Phase 3: Community Integration (Month 2-6)  
- **Advanced Ambulation Training**  
  - Gait analysis with assistive device progression (walker → quad cane)  
  - Outdoor mobility practice (uneven surfaces, curb training)  
- **Bone Health Protocol**  
  - Low-impact weight-bearing exercises (Tai Chi adapted for osteoporosis)  
  - Fall prevention education with home hazard assessment  
- **Fatigue Management**  
  - Pacing strategies with activity diaries  
  - Sleep hygiene protocol (stimulus control, circadian alignment)  
- **Multimodal Monitoring**  
  - Weekly Barthel Index reassessment  
  - Monthly DEXA scans coordination with endocrinology  
  - Cardiac rehab integration post-cardiology clearance (≥3 months post-myocarditis)  

> *Precautions: All activities require continuous O₂ saturation monitoring. Strict spinal precautions during transfers (no trunk rotation >45°). Exercise terminated for any chest pain/arrhythmia. Glucose monitoring pre/post activity.*
