# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (1–4 weeks)
- Improve muscle strength in trunk and proximal limbs to MMT grade 4.
- Increase Barthel Index score to 60 to enhance independence in basic ADLs (e.g., feeding, dressing, transfers).
- Enhance respiratory function to improve cough strength and reduce risk of pulmonary complications.
- Reduce generalized weakness and improve subjective energy levels.
- Establish a stable sleep pattern to improve mental state and recovery.

### Long-term Goals (4–12 weeks)
- Achieve functional independence in ADLs (Barthel Index score ≥80).
- Restore muscle strength to MMT grade 4+ in trunk and proximal limbs and 5 in distal limbs.
- Optimize respiratory function to support physical activity and prevent infections.
- Improve social participation through enhanced mobility and communication (addressing dysphonia).
- Manage osteoporosis to reduce fracture risk and support physical rehabilitation.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy
- **Progressive Resistance Training (PRT):**
  - Focus on trunk and proximal limb muscles using bodyweight exercises (e.g., seated leg press, partial sit-ups) and light resistance bands.
  - Frequency: 3–4 sessions/week, 10–15 repetitions/set, 2–3 sets, adjusted based on fatigue levels.
  - Monitor for overexertion due to low BMI (13.8) and anemia-related fatigue.
- **Functional Mobility Training:**
  - Bed-to-chair transfers and sit-to-stand exercises to improve ADL performance.
  - Gait training with assistive devices (e.g., walker) to enhance stability and confidence.
  - Frequency: Daily, 10–15 minutes, progressing to 20–30 minutes as tolerated.
- **Balance Training:**
  - Seated and standing balance exercises (e.g., weight shifting, reaching tasks) to reduce fall risk, critical given severe osteoporosis.
  - Frequency: 3 sessions/week, 10–15 minutes.

### Respiratory Therapy
- **Diaphragmatic Breathing Exercises:**
  - Teach deep breathing techniques to enhance lung expansion and cough strength.
  - Frequency: 3–5 sessions/day, 5–10 minutes each.
- **Incentive Spirometry:**
  - Use to improve lung volume and prevent atelectasis, especially post-laparoscopic surgery.
  - Frequency: 10 breaths every 1–2 hours while awake.
- **Cough Training:**
  - Assisted coughing techniques to strengthen cough and clear secretions.
  - Frequency: 2–3 sessions/day, guided by respiratory therapist.

### Occupational Therapy
- **ADL Training:**
  - Focus on self-care tasks (e.g., feeding, dressing, grooming) to improve Barthel Index score.
  - Use adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled reachers, button hooks) to compensate for weakness.
  - Frequency: Daily, 20–30 minutes.
- **Energy Conservation Techniques:**
  - Educate patient on pacing activities to manage generalized weakness and low energy.
  - Frequency: Integrated into daily therapy sessions.

### Speech Therapy
- **Dysphonia Management:**
  - Vocal exercises to strengthen vocal cords and improve voice clarity.
  - Techniques: Gentle humming, pitch glides, and sustained phonation.
  - Frequency: 3 sessions/week, 15–20 minutes.
- **Swallowing Assessment:**
  - Evaluate for potential dysphagia (post-chemotherapy, low BMI) and recommend safe swallowing strategies if needed.
  - Frequency: Initial assessment, followed by weekly monitoring.

### Nutritional Support
- **Dietary Consultation:**
  - Collaborate with a dietitian to design a high-calorie, high-protein diet to address low BMI (13.8) and muscle atrophy.
  - Small, frequent meals to manage reflux esophagitis and gastrointestinal issues.
  - Monitor for anemia-related dietary needs (e.g., iron-rich foods, vitamin B12).
  - Frequency: Weekly consultations, daily monitoring by nursing staff.

### Psychological and Sleep Support
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I):**
  - Address poor sleep quality with sleep hygiene education and relaxation techniques (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation).
  - Frequency: 1–2 sessions/week with a psychologist.
- **Psychosocial Support:**
  - Counseling to address poor mental state, focusing on coping strategies for chronic illness and post-surgical recovery.
  - Frequency: Weekly sessions, 30–45 minutes.

### Osteoporosis Management
- **Weight-Bearing Exercises:**
  - Incorporate low-impact activities (e.g., seated marching, standing heel raises) to stimulate bone health, tailored to patient’s low strength and fracture risk.
  - Frequency: 3 sessions/week, 10–15 minutes.
- **Pharmacological Coordination:**
  - Liaise with endocrinologist to ensure continuation of osteoporosis treatment (e.g., bisphosphonates, vitamin D, calcium supplementation).
  - Monitor for side effects, especially given history of drug-induced liver injury.

### Pain and Fatigue Management
- **Pain Monitoring:**
  - Regular assessment for abdominal pain or surgical site discomfort using a numerical pain scale.
  - Non-pharmacological interventions: Heat therapy or gentle massage if indicated.
  - Coordinate with medical team for pharmacological pain management if needed.
- **Fatigue Management:**
  - Schedule therapy sessions during peak energy times (e.g., mid-morning).
  - Short, frequent sessions to prevent overexertion.

### Monitoring and Follow-Up
- **Weekly Assessments:**
  - Re-evaluate MMT, grip strength, and Barthel Index score to track progress.
  - Monitor vital signs, respiratory status, and nutritional intake.
- **Multidisciplinary Team Meetings:**
  - Weekly meetings with oncology, cardiology, and gastroenterology teams to align rehabilitation with ongoing cancer and cardiac care.
- **Patient Education:**
  - Educate patient and family on rehabilitation goals, home exercises, and fall prevention strategies.
  - Provide written materials for exercise and dietary recommendations.

### Precautions
- Avoid high-impact exercises due to severe osteoporosis and risk of fractures.
- Monitor for signs of cardiac strain (e.g., chest pain, palpitations) given pacemaker and history of myocarditis.
- Adjust exercise intensity if anemia or fatigue worsens.
- Ensure infection control measures (e.g., hand hygiene, sterile equipment) due to history of intra-abdominal infection and chemotherapy-related immunosuppression.
