# Medical Record Information

## I. Clinical Summary

### Demographic Data
Male patient, 53 years old.

### Chief Complaint
Altered bowel habits for 1 year, rectal mass discovered over 7 months ago, post-operative day 1.

### History of Present Illness
One year ago (October 2022), the patient developed constipation without obvious cause, with bowel movements every 2 days. Symptoms gradually worsened to every 3-4 days, mostly yellow soft stools, occasionally with small amounts of fresh blood. Accompanied by lower abdominal pain occurring predominantly before defecation, tolerable in intensity and relieved after bowel movements. Intermittent nocturnal fever (37.5–38.5°C) occurred every 2-3 days. No anal pain, nausea, vomiting, chest tightness, or palpitations.  
Seven months ago (late January 2023), outpatient colonoscopy at our hospital revealed a protruding lesion at 15 cm from the anal verge with luminal narrowing. Diagnosis: Colon mass. Pathology: Adenocarcinoma (15 cm from anal verge).  
On February 11, 2023, received chemotherapy: Oxaliplatin 200mg + 5-Fluorouracil 0.75g + Calcium Folinate 0.1g, combined with immunotherapy: Pembrolizumab 200mg. Post-treatment fever (peak 39.9°C) with chills and rigors occurred. Symptoms resolved after anti-infective therapy with Piperacillin Sodium and Tazobactam Sodium.  
Readmitted to Gastroenterology for abdominal pain. Abdominopelvic CT (March 1, 2023): Wall thickening at rectosigmoid junction suggesting neoplasm, ill-defined borders with adjacent bowel, multiple mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes suggestive of metastasis. Diagnosed with intra-abdominal infection and septic shock. Treated with Vancomycin + Imipenem-Cilastatin Sodium, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and fresh frozen plasma transfusion. Vital signs stabilized post-treatment.  
Transferred to Cardiology (March 27, 2023). Serial cardiac biomarker panels indicated myocardial injury, likely immune checkpoint inhibitor-related myocarditis. Received supportive care. Underwent dual-chamber permanent pacemaker implantation (March 28, 2023), followed by multiple cycles of chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Underwent laparoscopic radical resection for rectal cancer on October 24, 2023.

### Past Medical History
Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed in 2019, previously treated with Insulin Degludec (currently discontinued). Diagnosed (June 2023) with: Severe osteoporosis, reflux esophagitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, thyroid nodule, cardiac insufficiency, drug-induced liver injury.

### Personal/Social, Obstetric, Family History
Non-contributory.

### Physical Examination
Vital signs stable. Cardiopulmonary examination unremarkable.  
Abdomen: Flat, no abdominal wall varicosities. Diaphragmatic respiration present. No visible peristalsis or intestinal patterns. Soft on palpation, no masses or tenderness. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Liver impalpable. Murphy's sign negative. No hepatic percussion tenderness. Spleen not enlarged. Tympanic percussion note. Shifting dullness negative. Bowel sounds 4–5/min, no borborygmi.

### Investigations
*   **Colonoscopy:** Post-chemotherapy changes at rectosigmoid junction.
*   **PET-CT:**
    1.  Sigmoid colon soft tissue mass with high FDG uptake, suggesting malignancy with peritumoral and retroperitoneal lymph node metastases. Segmental hypermetabolism in ascending/transverse/descending colon may indicate inflammation or non-specific uptake.
    2.  Hypermetabolic nodule in medial limb of right adrenal gland: adenoma vs. metastasis.
    3.  Focal hypermetabolism in right ilium: bone metastasis not excluded.
*   **Contrast-enhanced Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis CT:** Malignant lesion at rectosigmoid junction. Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes adherent to superior rectal artery/vein. Appendiceal thickening with ill-defined borders at cecal tip.
*   **Genetic Testing:** KRAS mutation detected in exon 2. No NRAS mutations in exons 2/3/4. No PIK3CA exon 20 mutation. No BRAF V600E mutation. Tumor classified as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) per NCI criteria. Confirmed diagnosis: Rectal adenocarcinoma with regional/retroperitoneal nodal metastasis; possible adrenal metastasis.

### Diagnoses
1.  Malignant neoplasm of rectum
2.  Myocarditis
3.  Anemia
4.  Presence of cardiac pacemaker
5.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus
6.  Thyroid cyst
7.  Severe osteoporosis
8.  Sleep disorder

### Functional Diagnoses
1.  Motor dysfunction
2.  Respiratory dysfunction
3.  Impaired activities of daily living (ADL)
4.  Impaired social participation

## II. Pre-rehabilitation Quantitative Assessment

*   **Subjective Symptoms:** Generalized weakness, cotton-wool sensation in feet, poor mental state, poor sleep quality.
*   **General Status:** Alert. Muscle atrophy in all limbs.
*   **Body Mass Index (BMI):** 13.8
*   **Grip Strength:** Left hand 11.5 kg, Right hand 12.2 kg
*   **Barthel Index Score:** 40
*   **Functional Performance:** Dysphonia, weak cough strength.
*   **Muscle Tone:** Normal tone in all limbs.
*   **Manual Muscle Testing (MMT):**
    *   Trunk muscles: 3- 
    *   Proximal limb muscles: 3+ 
    *   Distal limb muscles: 4-
