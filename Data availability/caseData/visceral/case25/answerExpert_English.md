# **1. Rehabilitation Goals**

## **Short-Term Goals:**
During the preoperative phase, improve the patient's nutritional status (malnutrition), sarcopenia, and poor cardiopulmonary function caused by chronic disease through progressive rehabilitation training. Specific objectives include: preventing bed rest complications, enhancing respiratory muscle strength and effective expectoration ability, increasing muscle strength in the extremities and core, improving sitting and standing balance, boosting exercise tolerance, and ultimately restoring independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) to prepare the patient for surgery.
During the perioperative phase, reduce the risk of complications such as pulmonary infection and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) through preoperative education and early postoperative intervention, promote rapid postoperative functional recovery, and shorten hospital length of stay.

## **Long-Term Goals:**
Enable the patient to successfully tolerate radical resection for rectal cancer, regain and maintain comprehensive independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Through the development and instruction of a home-based rehabilitation program, empower the patient with self-health management skills, further enhance cardiopulmonary function, overall muscle strength, and physical endurance, ultimately improving long-term quality of life.

# **2. Therapeutic Interventions**

The patient's rehabilitation program spans the preoperative, perioperative, and post-discharge phases. It is an individualized, progressive plan dynamically adjusted based on the patient's functional status, as detailed below:

## **I. Respiratory Function Training**
*   **Respiratory Muscle Strength and Expectoration Training:** Address weak cough effort through training of respiratory muscle strength and effective coughing techniques. Instruct the patient in protective coughing (minimizing abdominal muscle involvement) for postoperative use.
*   **Integration with Functional Activities:** Encourage active participation in daily activities to exercise respiratory function, such as washing the face and rinsing the mouth multiple times daily, and independently managing sputum and tissues.

## **II. Motor Function Training**
*   **Basic Mobility Training:**
    *   **Bed Mobility:** Instruct and train the patient in bed rolling and ankle pump exercises (home exercise requirement: 500 repetitions/day).
    *   **Transfers and Balance:** Progress from sitting up in bed and maintaining sitting balance at the edge of the bed to sitting balance (e.g., reaching while seated) and standing balance training.
    *   **Ambulation:** Progress from ambulating 100 meters with a walker to independently performing daily activities. Begin out-of-bed ambulation (50 meters) on postoperative day 1, gradually increasing distance daily to exceed 150 meters.

*   **Cardiopulmonary Endurance Training (Aerobic Exercise):**
    *   **Lower Body Cycle Ergometry:** Utilize a progressive protocol. Start with passive mode (15 minutes), gradually transition to active-assisted and then fully active mode (30 minutes, 0 resistance) within one week. Subsequently, progressively increase resistance (Levels 1-8). Frequency: 2 times/day. Later stage protocol standardizes to: 5-minute warm-up, 20-minute load cycling (heart rate maintained at 60%-80% of maximum heart rate), 5-minute cool-down.
    *   **Upper Body Ergometry (Arm Crank):** Introduce on postoperative day 3, starting at 0 resistance for 20 minutes. Daily progression includes increasing resistance and extending duration to 30 minutes, serving as the primary aerobic mode during postoperative recovery.
    *   **Home-Based Aerobic Exercise Guidance:** Based on 6-minute walk test (6MWT) results to assess metabolic equivalents (METs), instruct the patient to use walking as the primary exercise form. Adjust intensity based on functional improvement (targeting progression from 4-5 METs to 5-6 METs).

*   **Strength and Resistance Training:**
    *   **Home Exercise Program:** Initiate early, e.g., supine elastic band pulling (200 repetitions/day).
    *   **Functional Strength Exercises:** Include supported marching in place (100 steps/session) and supported heel raises (10 repetitions/set, 5 sets/day).
    *   **Systematic Resistance Training:** Design a regimen comprising 7 muscle exercises, such as biceps resistance training, standing push-ups (against wall/surface), single-leg bridges, seated row with elastic band (targeting core and extremity muscle groups). Perform 10 repetitions of each exercise per circuit, complete 2 circuits. Progressively increase load as tolerated. Emphasize avoiding the Valsalva maneuver during exertion.

## **III. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training**
*   **Basic ADL:** Focus early training on fundamental self-care abilities: feeding, toileting, dressing. Goal: Improve Barthel Index score from 40 (dependent) to >95 (essentially independent).
*   **Instrumental ADL (IADL):** During the home rehabilitation phase, encourage integrating rehabilitation into life by progressively performing household activities (e.g., room cleaning, cooking) to enhance social participation capacity.

## **IV. Patient Education and Self-Management**
*   **ERAS Concept Education:** Provide detailed explanations of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathway to the patient and family preoperatively and perioperatively. Emphasize the patient's active role in rehabilitation to improve treatment compliance.
*   **Preoperative Skill Instruction:** Teach postoperative pain-minimizing turning techniques, protective coughing methods, and preventive exercises (e.g., ankle pumps).
*   **Home Rehabilitation Guidance:** Instruct the patient in self-monitoring using a blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter. Develop a detailed, actionable home-based aerobic and resistance exercise plan.

## **V. Monitoring and Assessment**
Continuously monitor vital signs (blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate) throughout all training sessions to ensure safety. Quantify rehabilitation outcomes through regular assessments including the Barthel Index, Manual Muscle Testing (MMT), grip strength, Body Mass Index (BMI), and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Dynamically adjust the subsequent treatment plan based on these evaluations.
