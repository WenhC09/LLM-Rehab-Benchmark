 # Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:

### Short-term goals (2-4 weeks):
- Improve respiratory function and cough effectiveness to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications
- Increase functional mobility from bed to chair and ambulation with assistance
- Improve Barthel Index score from 40 to 60 points
- Establish safe oral intake and adequate nutrition support
- Achieve pain control and optimize wound healing
- Prevent postoperative complications (DVT, pressure ulcers, pneumonia)

### Long-term goals (2-3 months):
- Restore functional independence in basic ADLs (Barthel Index â‰¥80 points)
- Improve muscle strength to grade 4 in trunk and proximal muscles
- Achieve independent ambulation for household distances
- Increase BMI to at least 16-17 through nutritional rehabilitation
- Return to modified social participation and quality of life improvement
- Establish home exercise program for ongoing strength and endurance training

## 2. Treatment Methods:

### Respiratory Rehabilitation:
- Deep breathing exercises: 10 repetitions every hour while awake
- Incentive spirometry training: 10 breaths every 2 hours
- Assisted cough techniques and huffing exercises
- Progressive respiratory muscle training with threshold devices
- Early mobilization to improve ventilation/perfusion matching

### Motor Function Training:
- **Phase 1 (POD 1-3):**
  - Active-assisted range of motion exercises in bed
  - Ankle pumps and quadriceps sets
  - Progressive sitting balance training
  - Transfer training with maximal assistance

- **Phase 2 (POD 4-7):**
  - Standing balance exercises with parallel bars
  - Graduated ambulation with walker and supervision
  - Core stabilization exercises in supported positions
  - Upper extremity strengthening with resistance bands

- **Phase 3 (Week 2-4):**
  - Progressive resistance training for major muscle groups
  - Functional mobility training (stairs, obstacles)
  - Balance and coordination exercises
  - Endurance training with interval walking

### Activities of Daily Living Training:
- Self-care retraining (grooming, dressing, bathing) with adaptive equipment
- Energy conservation techniques
- Pacing strategies for fatigue management
- Environmental modifications for safety

### Nutritional Support:
- Collaboration with dietitian for high-calorie, high-protein diet plan
- Small, frequent meals to improve tolerance
- Oral nutritional supplements between meals
- Monitor albumin and prealbumin levels weekly

### Cardiac Precautions:
- Continuous cardiac monitoring during initial mobility
- Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) monitoring (maintain <13/20)
- Blood pressure and heart rate monitoring pre/post activity
- Pacemaker precautions during upper extremity exercises

### Psychological Support:
- Sleep hygiene education
- Relaxation techniques for anxiety management
- Referral to psychology for adjustment counseling
- Family education and involvement in care

### Additional Interventions:
- DVT prophylaxis with compression devices and early mobilization
- Positioning program to prevent pressure ulcers
- Pain management with multimodal approach
- Osteoporosis precautions during all activities
- Fall prevention strategies

### Frequency and Duration:
- Physical therapy: 2 sessions daily, 30-45 minutes each
- Occupational therapy: Daily, 30 minutes
- Respiratory therapy: 3-4 times daily, 15-20 minutes
- Reassessment weekly with goal adjustment as needed
