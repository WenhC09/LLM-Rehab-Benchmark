# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks)
- Improve trunk and proximal limb muscle strength by at least 0.5 MMT grade.
- Increase Barthel Index score from 40 to ≥55 to enhance basic ADL independence.
- Improve grip strength by ≥2 kg bilaterally.
- Enhance cough efficiency and respiratory muscle strength to reduce postoperative pulmonary complication risk.
- Improve nutritional intake and BMI toward ≥15 through multidisciplinary intervention.
- Reduce subjective fatigue and improve sleep quality.

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months)
- Achieve Barthel Index ≥80, enabling independent performance of most ADLs.
- Restore trunk and proximal limb muscle strength to MMT 4- or higher to facilitate safe mobility.
- Maintain stable cardiopulmonary status without exacerbation of myocarditis or heart failure.
- Achieve BMI ≥18.5 with improved muscle mass and bone mineral density maintenance.
- Enable safe community ambulation and reintegration into appropriate social roles.
- Establish long-term self-management strategies for cancer recovery, diabetes, osteoporosis, and cardiac health.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### (A) Physical Therapy
1. **Early Mobilization (POD 1–3)**
   - Bed mobility training, gradual transition from supine to sitting to standing under close monitoring of heart rate and BP (due to pacemaker and myocarditis history).
   - Passive and active-assisted ROM exercises for all limbs to prevent joint contractures.
   - Isometric trunk exercises for core stabilization.

2. **Progressive Strength Training**
   - Low-intensity resistance exercises (therabands, light weights) focusing on trunk and proximal limb muscles, progressing as tolerated.
   - Avoid Valsalva maneuver to minimize cardiac strain.
   - Frequency: 1–2 sessions/day, 20–30 minutes, 5–6 days/week.

3. **Balance and Gait Training**
   - Begin with static balance exercises in sitting/standing, progress to dynamic balance and gait with walker or cane as appropriate.
   - Incorporate dual-task training to facilitate safe ambulation in daily life.

### (B) Respiratory Therapy
- **Breathing Exercises:**
  - Diaphragmatic breathing and segmental breathing to improve ventilation.
  - Incentive spirometry 10 reps/hour while awake.
- **Airway Clearance:**
  - Huff coughing technique, manually assisted cough if needed due to weak cough strength.
- **Monitor** for signs of respiratory compromise or infection.

### (C) Occupational Therapy
- ADL retraining: dressing, grooming, toileting, feeding with adaptive techniques.
- Energy conservation strategies to cope with generalized weakness and anemia.
- Fine motor training to improve hand dexterity and grip strength.

### (D) Speech Therapy
- Voice therapy for dysphonia: vocal hygiene education, gentle phonation exercises.
- Swallowing screening before oral feeding progression, considering general weakness and possible aspiration risk.

### (E) Nutritional Support
- Dietitian-led individualized plan to address severe malnutrition (BMI 13.8).
- High-protein, high-calorie, nutrient-dense meals with possible oral nutritional supplements.
- Monitor blood glucose closely due to history of type 2 diabetes.
- Supplement calcium and vitamin D to address osteoporosis.

### (F) Psychological Support
- Psychological counseling to address sleep disorder, anxiety, and depression related to cancer diagnosis and treatment.
- Sleep hygiene education.

### (G) Medical Management Integration
- Close monitoring of cardiac status (pacemaker function, myocarditis history) during all exercises.
- Blood glucose monitoring and endocrinology consultation for glycemic control during rehabilitation.
- Osteoporosis management with antiresorptive agents as per medical team.
- Regular hemoglobin check to guide safe exercise intensity in anemia.

### (H) Patient & Family Education
- Education on safe mobilization at home, fall prevention strategies, and signs of cardiac or respiratory distress.
- Instruction on home exercise program tailored to tolerance and medical status.
- Guidance on nutrition, medication adherence, and follow-up schedules.

**Precautions:**
- Avoid high-intensity or isometric strain that could stress the myocardium.
- Monitor for orthostatic hypotension, dyspnea, chest pain, or arrhythmias during activity.
- Coordinate closely with oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and nutrition teams for integrated care.
