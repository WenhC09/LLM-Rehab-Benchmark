# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

**Date:** October 25, 2023 (Postoperative Day 1)

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (Inpatient phase, next 1-2 weeks):
*   **Respiratory Function:** Prevent postoperative pulmonary complications. Patient will independently perform 10 repetitions of diaphragmatic breathing and splinted coughing every hour while awake.
*   **Bed Mobility:** Improve functional independence in bed. Patient will be able to roll from supine to both sides and perform bridging with minimal assistance.
*   **Transfers & Mobilization:** Tolerate out-of-bed activity. Patient will tolerate sitting at the edge of the bed for at least 20 minutes twice daily without orthostatic hypotension and perform sit-to-stand transfers with moderate assistance of one person.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):** Increase participation in self-care. Patient will perform upper body grooming and feeding with set-up assistance while seated.
*   **Strength:** Mitigate effects of disuse atrophy. Maintain or improve muscle strength to current levels (Trunk 3-, Proximal 3+, Distal 4-) through active-assistive and active exercise.
*   **Pain Management:** Maintain pain level at or below 3/10 on a numeric pain scale during and after therapy sessions to facilitate participation.

### Long-term goals (Next 1-3 months):
*   **Ambulation:** Achieve limited household ambulation. Patient will be able to ambulate 50 feet with a rolling walker and minimal assistance on level surfaces.
*   **Strength:** Improve functional strength to support mobility and ADLs. Achieve muscle strength of at least 4/5 in proximal lower extremities and 4-/5 in trunk muscles.
*   **Endurance:** Improve cardiopulmonary endurance. Patient will tolerate 20 minutes of continuous light activity (e.g., seated exercises, slow walking) while maintaining stable vital signs.
*   **Functional Independence:** Maximize independence in self-care. Achieve a Barthel Index score of â‰¥60 (moderate dependence), indicating independence in feeding, grooming, and bathing with minimal assistance for dressing and transfers.
*   **Safety & Education:** Patient and family will be independent and proficient in a home exercise program, fall prevention strategies, and energy conservation techniques to ensure a safe transition home.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy (PT)
*   **Respiratory Physiotherapy:**
    *   **Initiate immediately.** Diaphragmatic breathing exercises to improve ventilation.
    *   Incentive spirometry to prevent atelectasis.
    *   Instruction in splinted coughing and huffing techniques to facilitate effective, less painful airway clearance.
*   **Bed Mobility Training:**
    *   Active-assistive range of motion (AAROM) for all extremities, progressing to active range of motion (AROM).
    *   Gentle bridging exercises in supine to activate gluteal and core muscles.
    *   Instruction in log rolling to minimize strain on the abdominal incision.
*   **Early Mobilization & Transfer Training:**
    *   **Strict monitoring of vital signs (HR, BP, SpO2) and subjective tolerance (RPE) is mandatory due to cardiac history and severe deconditioning.**
    *   Progressive mobilization: HOB elevation -> sitting at edge of bed (dangling) -> sit-to-stand training with assistive devices/personnel -> standing at bedside.
    *   Adherence to permanent pacemaker precautions (e.g., no lifting >10 lbs with left arm, no excessive left shoulder abduction/flexion).
*   **Therapeutic Exercise:**
    *   **Foundation:** Isometric exercises for quadriceps, gluteals, and core stabilizers.
    *   **Strength:** AAROM/AROM exercises in gravity-eliminated positions for hip and shoulder girdles (MMT < 3). Progress to against-gravity movements as tolerated. Light resistance (e.g., TheraBand) for distal muscles (MMT 4-).
    *   **Osteoporosis Management:** Focus on gentle, controlled weight-bearing activities (e.g., supported standing) once medically cleared. Avoid high-impact or trunk flexion/rotation exercises.
    *   **Neuropathy Management:** Sensory education regarding the "walking on cotton" sensation. Emphasize visual compensation for potential proprioceptive loss.

### Occupational Therapy (OT)
*   **ADL Retraining:**
    *   Focus on bed-level and seated self-care tasks (grooming, oral hygiene, upper body dressing).
    *   Introduce adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled sponge, reacher) as needed to reduce strain and improve independence.
*   **Energy Conservation & Work Simplification:**
    *   Educate patient on pacing, planning, and prioritizing activities to manage severe fatigue.
    *   Teach techniques such as sitting for tasks and organizing the immediate environment to minimize effort.
*   **Upper Extremity & Hand Function:**
    *   Gentle AROM for shoulders (respecting pacemaker precautions), elbows, wrists, and hands.
    *   Light therapeutic putty or soft stress ball exercises to gradually improve hand grip strength.
*   **Cognitive Function:**
    *   Provide orientation and simple structured tasks to address poor mental state and promote engagement.

### Speech and Language Therapy (SLP)
*   **Immediate consultation is warranted due to dysphonia and weak cough.**
*   **Voice Therapy:** Assess laryngeal function and implement exercises to improve vocal fold closure and phonatory support.
*   **Respiratory Support:** Coordinate with PT to implement exercises that improve respiratory muscle strength for a more effective, voluntary cough.
*   **Swallowing Assessment:** Perform a clinical swallow evaluation to rule out dysphagia and aspiration risk, especially given generalized weakness.

### Multidisciplinary Management
*   **Nutritional Support:** Collaborate closely with the dietitian and medical team. Rehabilitation progress is contingent on improving the patient's nutritional status (BMI 13.8). Therapy will focus on positioning and endurance to tolerate oral intake if/when appropriate.
*   **Psychological Support:** Provide consistent encouragement and establish a strong therapeutic rapport. Liaise with psychology/social work to address adjustment to illness, sleep disorder, and functional decline.
*   **Patient/Family Education:**
    *   Provide ongoing education on the treatment plan, rationale, and realistic expectations.
    *   Train family on safe transfer techniques, body mechanics, and fall prevention strategies in preparation for discharge.
    *   Review all relevant precautions (cardiac, osteoporotic, incisional).
