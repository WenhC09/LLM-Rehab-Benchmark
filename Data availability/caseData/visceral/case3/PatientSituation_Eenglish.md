# Patient Medical Record

## I. Clinical Summary

**Patient:** Male, 66 years old.

**Chief Complaint:** Right-sided limb movement inflexibility accompanied by dysarthria and dysuria for over 4 months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Approximately 4 months ago (December 9, 2022), the patient experienced a fall due to right-sided limb weakness while alone at home at 8:00 AM. He was discovered approximately 6 hours later, presenting with dysarthria (able to communicate simply), urinary incontinence, and clear consciousness. He was urgently transferred to a local hospital. Head CT revealed "hyperdense shadow in the left basal ganglia region," suggestive of "cerebral hemorrhage." An emergency "left frontal burr hole hematoma drainage" was performed under general anesthesia. Postoperatively, the patient exhibited increased somnolence but was responsive to verbal stimuli and capable of simple communication. Right-sided limbs were completely paralyzed, necessitating nasogastric and urinary catheterization. Consciousness gradually improved after 1 week. After stabilization, he was transferred to the Rehabilitation Medicine department. Nasogastric and urinary catheters were removed approximately 10 days post-operation. Following urinary catheter removal, dysuria developed, requiring continuous indwelling urinary catheterization to date. Comprehensive rehabilitation therapy commenced in January 2023. Right-sided limb weakness has improved compared to before, but current symptoms include right-sided limb movement inflexibility, ability to stand with assistance, and dysarthria. Admitted to our department for further rehabilitation.

**Past Medical History:**  
Hypertension for over 20 years, with highest recorded BP 160/90 mmHg. Currently managed on Losartan-Hydrochlorothiazide with BP controlled around 120/80 mmHg. Denies history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, trauma, blood transfusion, or prior surgeries. No known drug allergies. Vaccination history unknown. Denies history of infectious diseases or relevant exposure.

**Personal History:**  
Native-born. No history of prolonged residence elsewhere or in epidemic areas. No exposure to specific chemical substances or radiation. Denies smoking or alcohol consumption. Married; spouse healthy. One son, healthy.

**Family History:**  
Parents deceased; both had hypertension. Sister has hypertension.

**Physical Examination:**
*   **Vital Signs:** Temperature 36.3°C, Pulse 84 bpm, Respiratory Rate 18 bpm, Blood Pressure 133/78 mmHg.
*   **Mental Status:** Alert, emotionally stable. Able to follow one-step commands; partially able to follow multi-step commands. Spontaneous speech non-fluent with word-finding difficulty. Repetition intact. Written language comprehension at single-word level partially intact. Mild impairment in calculation and memory.
*   **Cranial Nerve Examination:** Pupils equal, round, reactive to light (diameter ~3.5mm bilaterally). Mild right-sided central facial and tongue palsy. Remaining cranial nerves intact.
*   **Motor System Examination:** Normal range of motion in all limbs.
    *   **Muscle Tone (Ashworth Scale):** Right upper limb flexor tone Grade 1, Right pronator tone Grade 2, Right hand flexor tone Grade 1, Right lower limb extensor tone Grade 1.
    *   **Motor Function (Brunnstrom Stage):** Right upper limb Stage II, Right hand Stage II, Right lower limb Stage III.
*   **Reflexes:** Right-sided tendon reflexes hyperactive. Right-sided pathological signs positive.
*   **Sensory System Examination:** Decreased deep and superficial sensation on the right side. Cortical sensation decreased.
*   **Other:** Abdomen soft, non-tender. No lower limb edema.

## II. Pre-admission Quantitative Assessments

### Auxiliary Examinations

*   **Head CT (December 9, 2022, External Hospital):** Hyperdense lesion in the left basal ganglia region, hemorrhage volume ~60 mL.
*   **Head MRI (January 30, 2023, External Hospital):** Postoperative changes following left basal ganglia cerebral hemorrhage evacuation. Accompanied by left corticospinal tract Wallerian degeneration, right cerebellar hemisphere encephalomalacia, and bilateral white matter degeneration.
*   **Urinary System Ultrasound (February 4, 2023, External Hospital):** Thickened bladder wall. Enlarged prostate with calcification.
*   **Urodynamic Study (April 3, 2023, Our Hospital):**
    *   **Results:** Maximum Urethral Closure Pressure (MUCP) at rest: 43 cmH₂O (supine). Filling cystometry (sitting): Stable detrusor pressure. First sensation at 228 mL. No detrusor overactivity or leakage observed during multiple cough tests. Sensation of fullness at 337 mL, infusion stopped. Unable to void upon command. After catheter removal, still unable to void. Post-void residual volume (PVR) measured by catheterization: 370 mL.
    *   **Analysis:** Stable detrusor pressure during filling phase. Bladder compliance approximately normal. Cystometric capacity approximately normal. Bladder wall relatively smooth. Bladder neck remained closed during both filling and voiding phases. No vesicoureteral reflux observed.
    *   **Impressions:** Stable detrusor pressure during filling phase. No significant detrusor contraction observed during voiding phase. Decreased bladder sensation.
*   **Urinalysis (April 25, 2023):** White Blood Cells 33.1/μL, 6/hpf.

### Pelvic Floor Muscle Function Assessment (May 15, 2023)

*   **Pre-Resting Phase:** Average 4.02 μV (Elevated), Variability 0.25 (Elevated), Score 79.58 (Low).
*   **Fast Contraction Phase (Type II Fibers):** Maximum 4.08 μV (Low), Rise Time 2.04 sec (Elevated), Recovery Time 2.19 sec (Elevated), Score 4.59 (Low).
*   **Tonic Contraction Phase (Type I Fibers):** Average 2.52 μV (Low), Variability 0.21 (Elevated), Score 27.47 (Low).
*   **Endurance Contraction Phase (Type I Fibers):** Average 2.38 μV (Low), Variability 0.30 (Elevated), Last 10s/First 10s Ratio 0.92 (Normal), Score 30.25 (Low).
*   **Post-Resting Phase:** Average 1.78 μV (Normal), Variability 0.21 (Elevated), Score 93.95.
*   **Total Score:** 31.60 (Low).
*   **Summary:** Assessment indicates slightly elevated pelvic floor muscle tension pre-resting; very poor strength of pelvic floor fast-twitch (Type II) muscles; very poor strength of pelvic floor slow-twitch (Type I) muscles during tonic contraction; very poor endurance of pelvic floor slow-twitch (Type I) muscles.
