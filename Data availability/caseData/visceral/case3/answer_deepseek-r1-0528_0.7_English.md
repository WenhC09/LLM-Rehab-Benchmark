# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (4-8 weeks)
- Achieve independent sitting balance and supervised standing
- Reduce right upper limb Ashworth score by 1 grade (flexors from 1+ to 1, pronators from 2 to 1+)
- Improve Brunnstrom stage: right hand to Stage III, right lower limb to Stage IV
- Establish effective intermittent catheterization protocol for bladder management
- Reduce pelvic floor muscle tension during pre-resting stage (target variability <0.20)
- Improve single-word comprehension to >80% accuracy
- Achieve modified independence in basic ADLs with adaptive equipment

### Long-term goals (3-6 months)
- Achieve household ambulation with single-point cane
- Attain Brunnstrom Stage IV for right upper limb
- Establish functional communication for daily needs
- Normalize pelvic floor muscle function (target total score >60 points)
- Eliminate indwelling catheter through bladder retraining
- Achieve modified independence in instrumental ADLs
- Develop compensatory strategies for cognitive deficits

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Motor Rehabilitation
- **Neurodevelopmental techniques:** Bobath approach for right hemiplegia management with focus on weight shifting and trunk control
- **Spasticity management:** 
  - Daily stretching protocol for right UE flexors (30min/session)
  - Serial casting for right pronators (changed weekly)
  - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to right tibialis anterior
- **Gait training:** 
  - Partial body weight support treadmill training (3×/week)
  - Overground ambulation with hemi-walker
- **Functional electrical stimulation:** Cyclic FES to right quadriceps during standing activities

### Urinary Rehabilitation
- **Bladder retraining protocol:**
  - Clean intermittent catheterization every 4 hours (target residual <100mL)
  - Timed voiding schedule with trigger techniques (Crede maneuver)
- **Pelvic floor rehabilitation:**
  - Biofeedback-assisted pelvic floor muscle training (3×/week)
  - EMG-triggered electrical stimulation for Type II fibers
  - Progressive resistance training for tonic contraction endurance
- **Medical coordination:** Urology consult for BPH management (alpha-blocker optimization)

### Speech and Cognitive Rehabilitation
- **Aphasia therapy:** 
  - Melodic Intonation Therapy for fluency improvement
  - Semantic feature analysis for word retrieval
  - Written choice communication strategy training
- **Cognitive rehabilitation:**
  - Errorless learning approach for memory training
  - Dual-task training for attention/executive function
  - Calendar-based orientation system

### Comprehensive Management
- **ADL training:** 
  - Task-specific upper limb constraint-induced movement therapy (2hrs/day)
  - Energy conservation techniques with occupational therapy
- **Cardiopulmonary:** Aerobic training on recumbent bike (RPE 11-13)
- **Education:** 
  - Hypertension management education (BP monitoring protocol)
  - UTI prevention strategies (hydration schedule, catheter care)
  - Caregiver training for transfer and communication techniques
- **Multidisciplinary coordination:** Weekly team meetings with PT/OT/ST/urology
