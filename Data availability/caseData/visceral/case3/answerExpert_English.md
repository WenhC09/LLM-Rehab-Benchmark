# **Rehabilitation Goals**

## **Short-Term Goals**
*   Improve bladder sensation and detrusor contraction ability, prevent and control urinary tract infections.
*   Successfully remove the indwelling urinary catheter and transition smoothly to intermittent catheterization.
*   Establish regular fluid intake and voiding habits through behavioral therapy to prepare for voluntary voiding.
*   Relax pelvic floor muscles to reduce voiding resistance and enhance patient control over pelvic floor muscles.

## **Long-Term Goals**
*   Restore autonomous bladder storage and voiding function, achieve complete voluntary voiding, and normalize post-void residual urine volume (less than 50mL).
*   Improve the patient's quality of life, reduce the physiological and psychological burden caused by voiding dysfunction, and promote the recovery of social participation ability.

# **Treatment Methods**

1.  **Conventional Comprehensive Rehabilitation Therapy**: Following a comprehensive functional assessment, provide systematic rehabilitation therapy. This includes administering secondary prevention medication and concurrently conducting motor rehabilitation, speech rehabilitation, and cognitive rehabilitation training to address issues such as hemiplegia, aphasia, and cognitive impairment.

2.  **Pharmacotherapy**: Continue treatment with Finasteride and Silodosin for the patient's benign prostatic hyperplasia to alleviate urethral outlet obstruction.

3.  **Behavioral Therapy and Bladder Training**:
    *   **Fluid Management**: Develop an individualized fluid intake plan requiring scheduled fluid intake with controlled volume (total 1500-2000 mL per day), with detailed recording of fluid intake and urine output.
    *   **Bladder Training**: Prior to catheter removal, conduct bladder training via scheduled opening of the indwelling catheter. Initially open approximately every 4 hours, aiming for a target voided volume of around 400 mL per session. Dynamically adjust fluid intake for corresponding periods based on actual voided volumes to gradually establish a stable, individualized voiding pattern.

4.  **Intermittent Catheterization Protocol**: Remove the indwelling catheter 3 days after admission and transition to intermittent catheterization, implemented in a stepwise progression:
    *   **Phase I (Scheduled Intermittent Catheterization)**: Perform catheterization strictly every 4 hours to ensure regular bladder emptying.
    *   **Phase II (Partial Voluntary Voiding)**: As voluntary voiding function emerges, gradually extend the catheterization interval to 4-6 hours to encourage voluntary voiding, while monitoring post-void residual (PVR) urine to ensure effective bladder emptying.
    *   **Phase III (Predominantly Voluntary Voiding)**: When the patient can voluntarily void most urine and PVR is consistently less than 100 mL in most instances, reduce catheterization frequency to twice daily (upon waking and before bedtime). Discontinue intermittent catheterization completely once PVR remains consistently below 50 mL.

5.  **Intravesical Electrical Stimulation (IVES)**: Based on urodynamic findings indicating detrusor underactivity and reduced bladder sensation, administer intravesical electrical stimulation therapy. Treatment parameters: pulse amplitude 10mA, pulse width 2 ms, frequency 20 Hz. Administer 45 minutes daily for 4 consecutive weeks to enhance bladder sensory afferent input and promote detrusor functional recovery.

6.  **Pelvic Floor Muscle Therapy**:
    *   **Pelvic Floor Muscle Electrical Stimulation**: The patient exhibits slight pelvic floor muscle tension, with very poor strength and endurance in both fast-twitch (Type II) and slow-twitch (Type I) fibers. Apply pelvic floor muscle electrical stimulation to relax tense muscles and thereby reduce voiding resistance.
    *   **Pelvic Floor Biofeedback Training**: Conduct concurrent pelvic floor biofeedback training to help the patient perceive and learn active control of pelvic floor muscle contraction and relaxation.

7.  **Acupuncture Therapy**: From a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) perspective, neurogenic bladder falls under categories like "Lin Zheng" (Dysuria Syndrome) and "Long Bi" (Dysuria and Urinary Retention). Utilize acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy. Select commonly used acupoints: BL33 (Zhongliao), SP6 (Sanyinjiao), ST28 (Shuidao), BL35 (Huiyang), CV6 (Qihai), CV4 (Guanyuan), CV3 (Zhongji). The aim is to regulate Qi and blood, unblock meridians, and improve bladder function.
