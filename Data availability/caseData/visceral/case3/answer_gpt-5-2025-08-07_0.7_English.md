# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (4–6 weeks)
- **Motor function:**
  - Improve Brunnstrom stage of right upper limb and hand from Stage II toward Stage III, and right lower limb from Stage III toward Stage IV.
  - Reduce right upper limb pronator spasticity (Ashworth 2) to ≤1+.
  - Enhance postural control to enable standing with minimal assistance and safe transfer with supervision.
- **Speech and cognition:**
  - Increase speech fluency and word retrieval for basic daily needs.
  - Improve comprehension of simple two-step commands.
  - Enhance attention and short-term memory span.
- **Bladder function:**
  - Initiate bladder training to reduce post-void residual volume, aiming for <200 mL.
  - Improve pelvic floor muscle strength (Type I & II fibers) by at least 20% in EMG amplitude.
- **ADLs:**
  - Achieve independence in feeding and grooming with adaptive techniques.
  - Reduce assistance level for dressing and toileting.
  
### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
- **Motor function:**
  - Achieve functional use of right hand for assisting in bimanual activities.
  - Ambulate ≥50 meters with appropriate assistive device and supervision or minimal assistance.
- **Speech and cognition:**
  - Communicate effectively in short sentences with minimal word-finding difficulty.
  - Comprehend and execute multi-step instructions relevant to daily activities.
- **Bladder function:**
  - Achieve voluntary initiation of micturition with post-void residual <100 mL.
  - Discontinue indwelling catheter if safe and feasible.
- **ADLs & social participation:**
  - Regain independence in most self-care activities.
  - Resume selected social roles and hobbies compatible with functional level.
  - Improve quality of life and psychological well-being.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 Motor Function Rehabilitation
- **Neurofacilitation techniques:**  
  - Bobath approach for postural control, tone normalization, and movement pattern facilitation.
  - Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) for limb activation, especially in right upper limb flexor/extensor synergy breaking.
- **Task-oriented training:**  
  - Sit-to-stand, step initiation, weight shifting, and supported gait training with parallel bars progressing to walker/cane.
- **Strength and endurance training:**  
  - Use of active-assisted and resisted exercises for unaffected side and active-assisted for affected side.
- **Spasticity management:**  
  - Daily stretching of right pronators, elbow/wrist flexors, and right lower limb extensors.
  - Positioning and splinting to prevent contractures.
- **Balance training:**  
  - Static and dynamic balance exercises in sitting and standing.
  - Incorporate visual and proprioceptive feedback.

### 2.2 Speech and Cognitive Rehabilitation
- **Speech therapy:**
  - Oral-motor exercises to improve articulation.
  - Structured naming, repetition, and fluency drills.
  - Use of semantic and phonemic cueing strategies.
- **Cognitive training:**
  - Attention enhancement tasks, memory recall activities, problem-solving exercises.
  - Use of visual aids and step-by-step instructions for functional tasks.

### 2.3 Bladder Dysfunction Rehabilitation
- **Bladder training program:**
  - Scheduled voiding attempts every 2–3 hours during the day.
  - Gradual reduction of indwelling catheter use under urologic supervision; trial intermittent catheterization.
- **Pelvic floor muscle training:**
  - Biofeedback-assisted pelvic floor exercises focusing on both fast-twitch (quick flicks) and slow-twitch (sustained holds) fibers.
  - Sessions 2–3 times/day, progressing from supine to sitting/standing positions.
- **Adjunctive therapy:**
  - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation of pelvic floor muscles if no contraindication.
  - Bladder diary to monitor function and guide adjustments.

### 2.4 ADL and Functional Training
- **Occupational therapy:**
  - Training in self-care activities with adaptive devices (built-up handles, dressing aids).
  - Home environment modification education for safety.
- **Energy conservation and pacing techniques** to manage fatigue.
- **Family and caregiver education** on safe transfers, assistance techniques, and home program continuation.

### 2.5 Secondary Prevention & General Health
- **Hypertension control**: Continue antihypertensive regimen, regular BP monitoring.
- **Stroke secondary prevention**: Lifestyle counseling on healthy diet, regular physical activity within safe limits.
- **Skin care**: Prevent pressure injuries via regular repositioning and skin inspection.
- **Psychological support**: Counseling to address mood, motivation, and adjustment issues.

### 2.6 Treatment Schedule
- **Physical therapy**: 5–6 days/week, 45–60 min/session.
- **Occupational therapy**: 5 days/week, 30–45 min/session.
- **Speech therapy**: 3–5 days/week, 30 min/session.
- **Pelvic floor training**: Daily, multiple short sessions.
- **Cognitive training**: Incorporated into OT/ST sessions and home program.
