# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

Based on the patient's condition as of May 15, 2023.

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4-6 weeks):

1.  **Urinary Function:** Successfully remove the indwelling urinary catheter and establish a regular bladder management program using Clean Intermittent Catheterization (CIC) every 4-6 hours to ensure post-void residual (PVR) urine is consistently below 150 mL and to prevent urinary tract infections.
2.  **Mobility:** Improve right lower limb motor control and core stability to achieve independent standing for at least 1 minute and initiate gait training with a quad cane and minimal assistance for a distance of 10 meters.
3.  **Upper Limb Function:** Inhibit spasticity in the right upper limb (especially pronators), increase active-assistive range of motion in the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, and initiate attempts at gross grasp and release.
4.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):** Achieve independence in feeding and grooming using one-handed techniques and minimal assistance for upper body dressing.
5.  **Communication:** Improve auditory comprehension to reliably follow two-step commands and utilize word-finding strategies to express basic needs and ideas more effectively.
6.  **Cognition:** Improve sustained attention for at least 15 minutes during therapy tasks.

### Long-term goals (within 3-6 months):

1.  **Urinary Function:** Patient and/or family to independently manage the CIC schedule, maintaining PVR <100 mL, and remaining free of symptomatic urinary tract infections, thereby achieving social continence.
2.  **Mobility:** Achieve independent ambulation indoors with a quad cane and navigate stairs with supervision, enhancing community mobility.
3.  **Upper Limb Function:** Utilize the right upper limb as a functional assistive limb in bimanual activities (e.g., stabilizing paper while writing, holding a container while opening it).
4.  **ADL:** Achieve modified independence in all basic ADLs (bathing, dressing, toileting, transfers).
5.  **Communication & Cognition:** Participate in simple family conversations and manage a simple daily schedule with the use of memory aids.
6.  **Social Participation:** Re-engage in valued family and limited community activities.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy (PT)

1.  **Neurodevelopmental Therapy (NDT/Bobath Approach):** Focus on inhibiting abnormal synergistic patterns and facilitating more normal movement sequences. Emphasize weight-bearing on the right side (both upper and lower limbs) to normalize tone and improve sensory feedback.
2.  **Lower Limb and Trunk Control Training:**
    *   Bridging, pelvic tilting, and trunk rotation exercises to improve core stability.
    *   Task-specific training for sit-to-stand transfers, progressing from maximal to minimal assistance.
    *   Balance training: Begin with static standing balance within parallel bars, progressing to dynamic balance activities (e.g., weight shifting, reaching).
3.  **Gait Training:**
    *   Pre-gait activities: Standing weight shifts, marching in place.
    *   Initiate gait training in parallel bars to ensure safety, progressing to a quad cane as stability improves. Focus on proper sequencing, weight transfer, and reducing synergistic patterns (e.g., hip hiking, circumduction).
4.  **Upper Limb Training:**
    *   **Spasticity Management:** Gentle, prolonged stretching of right upper limb flexors and pronators. Positional techniques to inhibit tone.
    *   **Motor Control:** Facilitate active movement out of synergy, starting with guided movements (active-assistive) and progressing to active movement. Focus on shoulder external rotation, elbow extension, and wrist/finger extension.
    *   **Sensory Re-education:** Apply various sensory stimuli (e.g., different textures, temperatures, deep pressure) to the right limbs to improve sensory awareness.

### Occupational Therapy (OT)

1.  **ADL Training:**
    *   Train in one-handed techniques for dressing, grooming, and bathing.
    *   Introduce adaptive equipment as needed (e.g., long-handled sponge, buttonhook, rocker knife).
    *   Incorporate the affected right upper limb as a stabilizer during tasks as function improves.
2.  **Upper Limb Functional Training:**
    *   **Mirror Therapy:** To improve motor control and reduce perceived paralysis/neglect of the right hand.
    *   **Task-Oriented Training:** Practice repetitive, meaningful tasks (e.g., wiping a table, stacking large cones) to encourage use of the affected arm.
    *   **Splinting:** Fabricate or provide a resting hand splint for nighttime use to prevent contractures and manage flexor spasticity.
3.  **Cognitive Rehabilitation:**
    *   Attention training exercises (e.g., cancellation tasks).
    *   Memory strategy training (e.g., use of a memory notebook, alarms).
    *   Problem-solving exercises related to daily activities.

### Speech and Language Therapy (SLT)

1.  **Aphasia Therapy:**
    *   **Expressive Language:** Implement Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA) or Verb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST) to improve word retrieval.
    *   **Auditory Comprehension:** Use graded exercises starting with one-step commands and progressing to two- and three-step commands, using both verbal and visual cues.
    *   **Functional Communication:** Practice scripts for common situations (e.g., greeting, asking for help). Train communication partner strategies with the family.
2.  **Dysarthria Therapy:** Exercises to improve strength, speed, and coordination of the facial and lingual muscles to enhance articulation clarity.

### Urological and Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation

1.  **Bladder Management Program:**
    *   Discontinue the indwelling catheter.
    *   Initiate a strict timed voiding schedule combined with **Clean Intermittent Catheterization (CIC)**. Initially, every 4 hours.
    *   Patient and family education and training on the CIC procedure is a top priority.
    *   Regularly monitor PVR with a bladder scanner to adjust the CIC frequency, aiming for a PVR <100-150 mL.
2.  **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT):**
    *   **Biofeedback:** Use surface EMG biofeedback to teach the patient to consciously contract and, importantly, relax the pelvic floor muscles. The goal is to improve strength and coordination for voiding.
    *   **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES):** Apply low-frequency electrical stimulation to the pelvic floor to improve muscle strength (both Type I and Type II fibers) and enhance proprioceptive feedback to the brain.
3.  **Medical Management:**
    *   Treat the current urinary tract infection based on urinalysis results, obtaining a urine culture and sensitivity if necessary.
    *   Consult with Urology regarding the Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) to determine if medical management (e.g., alpha-blockers) is warranted to reduce any potential outflow resistance, which could aid in bladder emptying.

### Patient and Family Education

1.  **Disease and Recovery:** Explain the nature of the stroke, the reasons for the specific deficits (motor, sensory, language, bladder), and the general prognosis for recovery.
2.  **Safety and Fall Prevention:** Instruct on home safety modifications, proper use of the assistive device, and awareness of the right-sided sensory deficit.
3.  **Home Exercise Program:** Provide a clear, written, and illustrated program for daily exercises to maintain range of motion, build strength, and practice functional tasks.
4.  **Bladder Program:** Ensure comprehensive understanding and demonstrated competence in the CIC protocol by the patient and/or primary caregiver. Emphasize the importance of hygiene and schedule adherence.
