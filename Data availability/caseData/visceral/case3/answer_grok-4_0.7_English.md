# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks):
- **Motor Function**: Improve right-sided limb motor function to Brunnstrom Stage III for upper limb and hand, and Stage IV for lower limb to enhance assisted mobility.
- **Spasticity Management**: Reduce right-sided limb spasticity to Ashworth Grade 1 or lower to facilitate smoother movements.
- **Speech and Communication**: Improve fluency and word-finding ability to enable short, clear sentences during daily interactions.
- **Bladder Function**: Reduce post-void residual volume (PVR) to <200 mL and achieve volitional voiding with assistance or timed voiding.
- **Cognitive Function**: Enhance ability to follow multi-step commands and improve basic calculation and memory skills for daily tasks.
- **ADLs**: Increase independence in basic ADLs (e.g., feeding, grooming) with minimal assistance using adaptive strategies.

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
- **Motor Function**: Achieve Brunnstrom Stage IV for upper limb and hand, and Stage V for lower limb to support independent ambulation with assistive devices.
- **Spasticity Management**: Maintain minimal spasticity (Ashworth Grade 0–1) to support functional movements.
- **Speech and Communication**: Achieve fluent speech with minimal word-finding difficulty for effective social communication.
- **Bladder Function**: Establish independent voiding with normal PVR (<100 mL) and no reliance on indwelling catheterization.
- **Cognitive Function**: Improve cognitive skills to support complex ADLs and basic social participation.
- **ADLs and Social Participation**: Achieve modified independence in ADLs and engage in simple community activities with support.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Motor Function and Spasticity Management
- **Physical Therapy (PT)** (5 sessions/week, 45 min/session):
  - **Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT)**: Encourage use of right upper limb through repetitive task-specific exercises (e.g., reaching, grasping small objects) for 30 min/session to improve Brunnstrom Stage II to III.
  - **Lower Limb Training**: Progressive weight-bearing exercises (e.g., sit-to-stand transitions, partial squats with support) to advance lower limb to Brunnstrom Stage IV. Use parallel bars or walker for stability.
  - **Spasticity Management**: Stretching and range-of-motion (ROM) exercises for right-sided limbs focusing on flexor and pronator muscles (15 min/session). Apply prolonged low-load stretching to reduce Ashworth Grade 2 spasticity in right pronator.
  - **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**: Apply to right upper and lower limb muscles (e.g., wrist extensors, quadriceps) to enhance muscle activation and reduce atrophy (20 min/session, 3 times/week).
- **Occupational Therapy (OT)** (4 sessions/week, 45 min/session):
  - Task-oriented training for right hand (e.g., buttoning, utensil use) to improve dexterity and advance Brunnstrom Stage II.
  - Use of adaptive equipment (e.g., built-up utensils, universal cuff) to facilitate ADL independence.
  - Bilateral arm training to promote coordination and reduce compensatory left-sided overuse.

### Speech and Communication
- **Speech-Language Therapy (SLT)** (4 sessions/week, 30 min/session):
  - **Articulation and Fluency Training**: Practice phoneme production and short sentence repetition to address dysarthria and improve fluency.
  - **Cognitive-Linguistic Therapy**: Word retrieval exercises (e.g., naming tasks, semantic cueing) to reduce word-finding difficulty. Use picture cards and functional communication tasks (e.g., ordering food).
  - **Augmentative Communication**: Introduce low-tech communication aids (e.g., picture boards) for use during therapy to support expression until fluency improves.

### Bladder Function
- **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT)** (5 sessions/week, 30 min/session):
  - Biofeedback-assisted exercises to strengthen Type I and II pelvic floor muscles, addressing low strength (2.52 μV tonic, 4.08 μV fast contraction) and poor endurance (30.25 score).
  - Focus on short, maximal contractions (5–10 sec) for Type II fibers and sustained holds (10–20 sec) for Type I fibers, progressing as strength improves.
- **Bladder Training Program**:
  - Timed voiding every 2–3 hours during the day to reduce PVR (currently 370 mL) and encourage bladder sensation.
  - Gradually reduce reliance on indwelling catheter by implementing intermittent catheterization (–4 times/day) under urologist supervision, monitoring for infection (urinalysis: WBC 33.1/μL).
- **Pharmacological Support** (in consultation with urologist):
  - Consider alpha-blockers (e.g., tamsulosin) for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) to improve bladder neck relaxation, given prostate enlargement noted on ultrasound.
  - Monitor for detrusor underactivity; consider cholinergic agents if no improvement in voiding after 4 weeks.

### Cognitive Function
- **Cognitive Rehabilitation** (3 sessions/week, 30 min/session, integrated with OT/SLT):
  - Memory training: Repetitive recall tasks (e.g., remembering daily schedules, names) to address mild memory impairment.
  - Executive function exercises: Multi-step task practice (e.g., planning a simple meal) to improve ability to follow complex commands.
  - Use of compensatory strategies: Memory aids (e.g., notebooks, calendars) to support daily organization.

### Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Social Participation
- **ADL Training** (integrated with OT, 4 sessions/week):
  - Practice self-care tasks (e.g., dressing, grooming) with adaptive techniques to increase independence.
  - Environmental modifications: Recommend raised toilet seats and grab bars to support safe transfers, given right-sided weakness and dysuria.
- **Psychosocial Support** (1 session/week, 30 min):
  - Counseling with a rehabilitation psychologist to address emotional adjustment to reduced social participation and promote motivation.
  - Gradual introduction of group therapy or community-based activities (e.g., supervised outings) to enhance social engagement.

### Additional Considerations
- **Hypertension Management**: Continue Losartan-Hydrochlorothiazide, monitor BP (target <130/80 mmHg) during therapy to prevent cardiovascular stress.
- **Fall Prevention**: Educate patient and family on safe transfers and use of assistive devices (e.g., cane, walker) to minimize fall risk, given history of fall and right-sided weakness.
- **Monitoring and Reassessment**: Weekly evaluation of Brunnstrom stages, Ashworth scores, and PVR. Repeat urodynamic study in 8 weeks to assess bladder function progress. Adjust plan based on functional improvements or complications (e.g., urinary tract infections).
