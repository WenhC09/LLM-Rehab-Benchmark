 # Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (4-6 weeks):
- Improve right upper limb function from Brunnstrom Stage II to Stage III
- Enhance standing balance to achieve independent standing for 30 seconds
- Reduce spasticity in right upper limb to Ashworth Grade 1 or less
- Establish bladder training program to reduce post-void residual volume by 30%
- Improve speech fluency and word-finding ability for basic daily communication
- Achieve modified independence in basic ADLs (eating, grooming) with adaptive equipment

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Progress right upper limb to Brunnstrom Stage IV-V with functional grasp capability
- Achieve independent ambulation with assistive device for household distances
- Restore bladder function to allow catheter-free management with timed voiding
- Improve cognitive function for complex task completion and problem-solving
- Achieve independence in most ADLs and partial independence in IADLs
- Enable return to meaningful social participation and family roles

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy
- **Motor relearning program**: Task-specific training for right upper and lower extremities, 45 minutes daily
- **Gait training**: Progressive weight-bearing exercises, parallel bar walking advancing to walker ambulation, 30 minutes daily
- **Balance training**: Static and dynamic balance exercises in sitting and standing positions, 20 minutes daily
- **Spasticity management**: Prolonged stretching, positioning, and weight-bearing exercises for affected limbs
- **Functional electrical stimulation (FES)**: Apply to right dorsiflexors and wrist extensors, 20 minutes twice daily

### Occupational Therapy
- **Upper extremity rehabilitation**: Constraint-induced movement therapy modified for current function level, 2 hours daily
- **ADL training**: Progressive training in self-care activities using compensatory strategies and adaptive equipment
- **Cognitive rehabilitation**: Attention, memory, and executive function training through functional tasks
- **Home modification assessment and training**: Prepare for safe home environment

### Speech and Language Therapy
- **Language therapy**: Word retrieval exercises, semantic and phonemic cueing strategies, 30 minutes daily
- **Speech motor training**: Oral motor exercises for improved articulation
- **Functional communication training**: Practice daily communication scenarios

### Bladder Rehabilitation
- **Pelvic floor muscle training**: Based on biofeedback results, focus on improving both fast and slow-twitch muscle function
- **Bladder training program**: Scheduled voiding every 3-4 hours with gradual interval extension
- **Clean intermittent catheterization training**: Teach technique to patient/caregiver as bridge to continence
- **Fluid management education**: Optimize intake timing and volume

### Medical Management
- **Spasticity**: Consider oral antispasticity medications if physical measures insufficient
- **Neurogenic bladder**: Alpha-blocker therapy for BPH component, monitor for UTI prevention
- **Blood pressure**: Continue current antihypertensive regimen with close monitoring
- **Secondary stroke prevention**: Ensure appropriate medications and risk factor modification

### Psychological Support
- **Counseling**: Address adjustment to disability and motivation for rehabilitation
- **Family education**: Train primary caregiver in safe transfer techniques and home exercise program
- **Support group participation**: Connect with stroke survivor groups

### Treatment Schedule
- **Frequency**: 5-6 days per week comprehensive rehabilitation program
- **Duration**: Initial intensive phase 6-8 weeks, followed by maintenance program
- **Reassessment**: Weekly team meetings, formal reassessment every 2 weeks
- **Discharge planning**: Begin early with home visit and community reintegration preparation
