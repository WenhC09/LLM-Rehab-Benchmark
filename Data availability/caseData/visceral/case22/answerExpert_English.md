### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-Term Goals:
*   Wean off ventilator support, extubate, and successfully transfer out of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
*   Restore out-of-bed mobility, including independent sitting, standing, and indoor ambulation with assistance.
*   Achieve independence from supplemental oxygen and regain basic self-care abilities.
*   Improve swallowing function, remove the nasogastric tube, and resume oral intake of food and fluids.
*   Alleviate shoulder pain and achieve initial improvement in upper limb muscle strength.

#### Long-Term Goals:
*   Further enhance respiratory function, particularly by maximizing the restoration of diaphragm function and diaphragmatic breathing patterns.
*   Improve cardiopulmonary endurance and overall physical stamina to tolerate subsequent tumor radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
*   Achieve complete independence in activities of daily living (ADLs), including independent stair negotiation and performance of complex ADLs (e.g., bathing).
*   Facilitate community reintegration and return to work.

### 2. Treatment Methods

Rehabilitation for this case is divided into three progressive phases based on the severity of the patient's condition and functional recovery:

#### Phase I: Critical Rehabilitation Phase (ICU Stay)

The core focus of this phase is maintaining hemodynamic stability, achieving early ventilator weaning, and preventing secondary complications.
*   **Limb Function Training:** Perform manual stretching of all four limbs to maintain joint range of motion (ROM); concurrently implement muscle strengthening exercises for limbs and trunk to counteract disuse atrophy.
*   **Positioning Training:** Implement gradual sitting-up training using adjustable bed functions in preparation for out-of-bed activities.
*   **Chest Physiotherapy:**
    *   **Manual Release:** Apply manual techniques to relax respiratory accessory muscles (e.g., neck, chest muscles) to reduce tension caused by compensatory breathing patterns.
    *   **Diaphragm Facilitation:** Utilize specific manual techniques and postures to stimulate and facilitate diaphragmatic contraction.
    *   **Thoracic Resistance Training:** Apply appropriate manual resistance to the thorax during patient exhalation or inhalation to enhance respiratory muscle coordination.
*   **Aerobic Exercise Training:** Conduct passive or active lower limb cycling training using a bedside cycle ergometer for 15-20 minutes daily, adjusting resistance based on patient tolerance.
*   **Respiratory Muscle Training:** Perform threshold-based inspiratory muscle strength training with visual feedback during daily ventilator weaning trials. Initial resistance is set at 5 cmH₂O based on Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) measurement and progressively increased as muscle strength improves.

#### Phase II: Transitional Rehabilitation Phase (Post-Transfer to General Ward)

The goal of this phase is to promote recovery of mobility and achieve basic self-care independence.
*   **Limb Function Training:** Continue muscle strengthening exercises for limbs and trunk. The therapist provides one-on-one intensive training focused on bilateral deltoid muscles showing significant weakness, while instructing the patient to independently exercise other muscle groups.
*   **Out-of-Bed Training:** Implement progressive transfer training (e.g., sitting up in bed, edge-of-bed sitting, standing) and gait training. Early ambulation may utilize a walking frame. Vital signs are closely monitored throughout to prevent falls.
*   **Chest Physiotherapy and Respiratory Muscle Training:** Continue treatments from the previous phase, adjusting intensity based on patient status.
*   **Aerobic Exercise Training:** Develop an individualized exercise prescription based on target heart rate and tolerance, potentially utilizing High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) protocols to enhance cardiopulmonary endurance.
*   **Swallowing and Phonation Training:** Conduct bedside instruction by a Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP), utilizing specific techniques and exercises to improve laryngeal elevation range, facilitate swallowing reflex, and progressively restore safe swallowing and speech clarity.

#### Phase III: Intensive Rehabilitation Phase

This phase aims for comprehensive functional enhancement to prepare for return to normal life and tolerance of subsequent treatments.
*   **Diaphragmatic Breathing Facilitation and Strengthening:**
    *   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Application:** Consult an experienced respiratory physiotherapist to educate the patient on the principles, benefits, and correct methods of diaphragmatic breathing, establishing accurate cognition.
    *   **Breathing Pattern Re-education:** Guide the patient to consciously reduce overuse of accessory respiratory muscles (neck, chest) through breath control. Utilize posture adjustment and enhanced abdominal proprioception to focus attention on abdominal movement, successfully facilitating diaphragmatic breathing.
    *   **Homework-Style Training:** Instruct the patient to perform 5-minute diaphragmatic breathing exercises hourly during waking hours. This high-frequency repetition of the correct pattern aims to solidify the diaphragmatic breathing pattern.
*   **Inspiratory Muscle Strength Training:** Conduct progressive, higher-intensity threshold-based inspiratory muscle training based on regularly measured MIP values to continuously enhance the strength and endurance of inspiratory muscles (particularly the diaphragm).
*   **High-Intensity Aerobic Exercise Training:** Perform high-intensity aerobic training (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, continuous step climbing) under continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Real-time monitoring of ECG, oxygen saturation (SpO₂), and blood pressure ensures training intensity reaches the target heart rate zone while maintaining safety.
*   **Muscle Strengthening Training:** Continue to enhance whole-body muscle strength, with emphasis on proximal upper limb muscle groups.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training:** Focus on instructing the patient in performing more complex ADL tasks, such as mastering techniques for donning/doffing varied clothing and independently completing bathing.
