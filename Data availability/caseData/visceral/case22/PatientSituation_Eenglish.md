# Case Information

## Medical Record Summary

*   **Patient Information**: Male, 28 years old.
*   **Chief Complaint**: Dyspnea for 40 days post-cervical surgery.
*   **Present Illness**: The patient underwent "en bloc resection of C3-C4 tumor with 3D-printed artificial vertebral body implantation and internal fixation" under general anesthesia in orthopedics 40 days ago for a "C3-C4 vertebral mass" suspected as "epithelioid sarcoma". Intraoperatively, the left C3 and C4 nerve roots and left vertebral artery were severed. Postoperatively, he was transferred to the ICU. During weaning attempts from mechanical ventilation, he developed dyspnea and failed weaning. Chest X-ray revealed "bilateral diaphragmatic elevation". After rehabilitation consultation, he was diagnosed with "post-cervical surgery, bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, respiratory dysfunction" and initiated bedside respiratory rehabilitation. Dyspnea and physical endurance gradually improved with prolonged ventilator weaning tolerance. Endotracheal tube was removed on postoperative day (POD) 12, transitioning to high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy; switched to nasal cannula oxygen (2-3L/min) on POD 16, achieving independent long-sitting in bed. Transferred to general orthopedic ward on POD 17. Functionally: achieved bedside sitting and brief standing on POD 19; ambulated with a walker within the ward on POD 20; ambulated ~50m in the corridor on POD 22; achieved independent ambulation under supervision on POD 28. Currently, he exhibits significant tachycardia during activity with poor exercise tolerance. Post-extubation, he developed "hoarse voice, dysphagia, and water aspiration". Speech clarity improved after speech therapy, but a nasogastric tube remains for nutrition/hydration. Bilateral shoulder pain and difficulty elevating upper limbs (right dominant) occurred during the course, suspected as "possible post-operative C5 radiculopathy". Pain resolved after treatment, but limb elevation remains effortful. Admitted to our department for further rehabilitation. Postoperative mental status is fair, physical strength poor, nutrition via nasogastric tube, sleep suboptimal, bowel/bladder normal, weight loss ~7kg.
*   **Past Medical History**: Hyperlipidemia diagnosed during physical examination 2 years ago. No other significant history.
*   **Personal/Social History**: Unmarried. Accompanied by parents and sister. Payment: Beijing Medical Insurance. Education: Bachelor's degree. Occupation: Office clerk. Residence: Elevator-equipped building with community barrier-free facilities.

## Physical Examination

*   **Vital Signs**: Temperature $36.4^{\circ}C$, Pulse 122 bpm, Respiratory Rate 18 bpm, Blood Pressure $139 / 93\mathrm{mmHg}$.
*   **General Appearance**: Wheelchair-bound upon admission.
*   **Respiratory System**: Predominantly thoracic breathing pattern. Significantly weakened diaphragmatic breathing. Diaphragmatic activation visible during inspiration in sitting position, bilaterally symmetrical. No paradoxical breathing. Adequate pulmonary clearance with effective independent sputum expectoration.
*   **Swallowing & Phonation**: Nasogastric tube in situ. Dysphagia with immediate water aspiration (minimal volume). Kubota Water Swallow Test Grade 5. Unable to perform sequential swallowing. Laryngeal elevation <1cm, delayed swallowing initiation. Pharyngeal reflex present but swallowing reflex diminished; enhanced initiation observed with stimulation. Oral preparatory and oral phases intact. Glottal vibration audible during phonation.
*   **Neck**: Transverse submandibular incision anteriorly and midline longitudinal incision posteriorly, both well-healed. Restricted cervical spine range of motion. Stiffness and adhesion of soft tissues near anterior incision.
*   **Manual Muscle Testing (MMT)**:
    *   Bilateral proximal upper limb weakness.
    *   Right Deltoid: Anterior fibers Grade 2+, Middle fibers Grade 3-.
    *   Left Deltoid: Anterior fibers Grade 3-, Middle fibers Grade 3+.
    *   Bilateral Biceps Brachii Grade 4+, Bilateral Triceps Brachii Grade 5.
    *   Right Shoulder External Rotation Grade 3-, Left Shoulder External Rotation Grade 4.
*   **Joints & Palpation**: Bilateral glenohumeral joint range of motion essentially normal. Tenderness over bilateral coracoid processes and bicipital grooves.
*   **Balance & Function**: Sitting balance Level 3, Standing balance Level 3. Elevated resting heart rate ($110\sim 120$ bpm), increasing to $140\sim 145$ bpm after ambulating 50m at moderate pace. Independent in rolling, sit-to-stand transfers, ambulation, bowel/bladder management, toileting, and grooming. Unable to ascend/descend stairs independently.

## Diagnostic Investigations

*   **Cervical Spine X-ray**: Postoperative AP/lateral views demonstrate C1-C6 internal fixation. No evidence of hardware loosening or displacement. Resection of C3-C4 vertebral bodies with spinal canal expansion.
*   **Chest X-ray**: Immediate postoperative film revealed bilateral diaphragmatic elevation with associated atelectasis. Follow-up at 1 month showed similar findings.
*   **Diaphragmatic Ultrasound**: Serial assessments showed bilateral diaphragmatic dysfunction:
    *   **POD 3**: Left diaphragm thickness 0.25cm, thickening fraction (TF) 12.0%; Right thickness 0.24cm, TF 12.5%.
    *   **POD 13**: Left thickness 0.22cm, TF 22.7%, excursion 0.5cm; Right thickness 0.23cm, TF 30.0%, excursion 1.2cm.
    *   **POD 26**: Left thickness 0.18cm, excursion 1.0cm; Right thickness 0.22cm, excursion 1.5cm.
