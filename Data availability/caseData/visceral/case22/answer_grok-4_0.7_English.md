# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (48 weeks):
- **Respiratory Function**: Improve diaphragmatic to ≥2.0 cm bilaterally and increase diaphragmatic thickening fraction (TF) to >40% to enhance respiratory efficiency and reduce dyspnea during low-intensity activities.
- **Swallowing Function**: Achieve safe intake of soft foods (Level 4 on International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative, IDDSI) without aspiration, as confirmed by modified Kubota Water Swallow Test (Grade ≤3).
- **Upper Limb Strength**: Increase bilateral deltoid to MMT Grade 4 and shoulder external rotation to Grade 4+ support basic activities of daily livingADL).
- **Exercise**: Ambulate 100 meters independently with heart rate increase limited to <130 bpm and no significant dyspnea.
- **Cervical Mobility**: Improve cervical range of motion by 20% to reduce stiffness and enhance functional neck movement.
- **Pain Management**: Eliminate residual shoulder pain during activity and.

### Long-term (3-6 months):
- **Respiratory Function**: independent breathing without supplemental oxygen, with normal diaphragmatic excursion (2.5 cm) and TF >50%, enabling sustained moderate activities without dyspnea.
- **Swallowing Function**: Return to regular diet (IDDSI Level 7) with no aspiration and remove nasogastric tube.
- **Upper Limb Function**: Restore deltoid and shoulder external rotation strength to MMT Grade 5, full ADL independence, including overhead tasks.
- **Exercise**: Ambulate ≥200 meters and climb one flight of stairs independently heart rate <120 bpm and no dyspnea.
- **Cervical**: Restore near-normal cervical range of motion (≥80% normal) and eliminate soft tissue adhesions.
- **Participation**: to work as an office clerk with modified duties and engage in community without restrictions.

## 2. Treatment Methods

 Respiratory Rehabilitation
- **Diaphragmatic Breathing Training**: 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times daily, in semi-reined and upright positions. Use biofeedback (e.g., ultrasound visualization) to enhance diaphragmatic activation. Focus on slow, controlled to maximize excursion.
- **Inspiratory Muscle TrainingIMT)**: Use a threshold inspiratory muscle trainer at 30-50% of maximal inspiratory pressure, 10-15 repetitions, 3 sets daily, 5 days. Adjust resistance weekly based on patient tolerance.
- **Pulmonary Clearance**: Active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) for 10 minutes, 2- times daily, to maintain airway clearance and prevent atelectasis.- **Positioning**: Encourage upright sitting and standing during therapy to lung expansion and reduce diaphragmatic load. Avoid prolonged supine positioning.

### Swallowing and Speech Rehabilitation
- **Swallowing Therapy**: 
  - Mendelsohn and effortful swallowing exercises, 10 repetitions, 3 sets daily, to enhance laryngeal elevation and pharyngeal strength.
  - Supraglottic swallow technique training prevent aspiration, practiced with small-volume (5 mL) thickened liquids (IDDSI Level 2), progressing to Level 3 tolerated.
  - Thermal-tile stimulation to improve swallowing reflex 5-10 minutes daily, cold stimulation to the anterior faucial pillars.
  - Weekly videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) to monitor progress and guide diet advancement
- **Speech Therapy**: 
  - Vocal exercises focusing on and volume control, 10 minutes, 3 times daily, to improveottal vibration and reduce hoarseness.
  - Artic drills targeting clear phoneme production, 10-15 minutes daily, progressing to conversational speech practice.

### Musculoskeletal and Functional Rehabilitation- **Upper Limb Strengthening**:
  - Isometric exercises for deltoids and shoulder external rotators, 10 repetitions, sets daily, progressing to isotonic exercises with 0.5- kg weights as strength improves to MMT Grade 4.
  --assisted range of motion (ROM) for shoulder elevation, 10-15 repetitions, 2 sets daily, using pulleys or therapist assistance
- **Cervical Mobility**:
  - Gentle passive and active-assisted cervical ROM exercises (flexion, extension, rotation), 10 repetitions, 2 sets daily, within pain-free range.
  - Soft tissue mobilization and myofasc release around anterior and posterior cervical incisions, 10-15 minutes, times/week, to reduce adhesions and stiffness.
- ** Training**:
  - Balance training: Standing balance exercises on stable surfaces, progressing to dynamic tasks (e.g., weight shifting), 15 minutes daily.
  - Gait training:ulation with walker for 50-100 meters, 2-3 times daily, focusing on endurance and heart rate control. Progress to unass ambulation as balance improves to Level 4.
  - ADL training: Task-specific exercises (e.g., reaching, lifting light objects) to improve upper limb function and independence, 20 minutes daily.

### Pain Management
- **Modalities**: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (T) over bilateral coracoid processes and bicipital grooves, minutes, 3 times/week, for residual shoulder pain.
-Manual Therapy**: Gentle joint mobilizations for bilateral glenohumeral joints, 10 minutes, 2-3 times/week, to maintain ROM and reduce tenderness.
### Cardiopulmonary Endurance
- **Aerobic Training**: Se or standing arm ergometry, 10-15 minutes, 3- times/week, at 50-60% of heart rate reservetarget HR 110-120 bpm), with continuous monitoring to avoid tachycardia (>140 bpm).
- **Energy Conservation Techniques**: Education on pacing and prioritizing to minimize fatigue and dyspnea during ADL, integrated into daily therapy sessions

### Nutritional and Psych Support
- **Nut Support**: Collaborate with a dietitian to optimize caloric and protein intake via nasogastric tube, targeting weight gain of 0.-1 kg/month to address 7 kg weight loss. Transition to intake as swallowing improves.
- **Psychosocial Support**: Weekly sessions to address mental health, sleep issues, and adjustment to limitations. Encourage family involvement to enhance motivation and support.

 Monitoring and Progression
- **Weekly Assessments**:
  -aphragmatic ultrasound to track excursion TF improvements.
  - Kub Water Swallow Test and VFSS monitor swallowing progress.
  -MT for deltoid and shoulder rotator strength.
  - rate and dyspnea monitoring during amb (Borg Scale).
 **Adjustments**: Progress exercise intensity and duration based on patient tolerance strength gains, and respiratory improvements. Re-evaluate goals every 4 weeks.

### Home and Community Integration
- **Home Exercise Program**: Provide a tailored program including diaphragmatic breathing, upper limb strengthening, and cervical ROM exercises, with written and visual instructions for patient and family.
- **Environmental Modifications**: Recommend adaptive equipment (e.g., raised toilet seat, shower chair) to support ADL independence. Leverage community barrier-free facilities for safe ambulation practice.
- **Follow-up**: Schedule outpatient rehabilitation visits 2-3 times/week post-discharge, with multidisciplinary team reviews every 4-6 weeks to assess progress toward long-term goals.
