### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-term goals (within 4 weeks):

1.  **Respiratory Function**:
    *   Achieve independence from supplemental nasal cannula oxygen at rest.
    *   Improve respiratory muscle endurance, demonstrated by an increase in Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) load and duration.
    *   Master energy conservation techniques and pursed-lip breathing to manage dyspnea during activities of daily living (ADLs).
    *   Maintain clear lungs with no signs of respiratory infection.

2.  **Swallowing Function**:

4.  **Education**:
    *   Ensure patient and family can independently demonstrate understanding and application of the home exercise program, swallowing safety precautions, and energy conservation strategies.

#### Long-term goals (within 3-6 months):

1.  **Respiratory Function**:
    *   Achieve sufficient respiratory function to perform all ADLs and moderate-intensity instrumental ADLs (IADLs) without dyspnea.
    *   Maximize recovery of diaphragmatic function as evidenced by ultrasound follow-up.

2.  **Swallowing Function**:
    *   Achieve safe and independent oral intake of a regular diet to meet all nutritional needs.
    *   Successful removal of the nasogastric tube.

3.  **Musculoskeletal Function & Mobility**:
    *   Achieve functional strength (grade 4+/5) in bilateral upper limbs to allow for full independence in all ADLs and IADLs, including overhead activities.
    *   Achieve independent community ambulation without an assistive device and with normal cardiovascular response.
    *   Return to part-time or full-time office work.

4.  **Overall Function**:
    *   Regain premorbid body weight and nutritional status.
    *   Achieve complete independence in all ADLs and IADLs.
    *   Improve quality of life and facilitate successful reintegration into social roles.

### 2. Treatment Methods

#### 1. Respiratory Rehabilitation

*   **Respiratory Muscle Training**:
    *   **Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT)**: Utilize a threshold pressure device, starting at a low intensity (e.g., 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure), 2 sessions/day, for 5-10 minutes per session. Progress resistance and duration as tolerated.
    *   **Breathing Pattern Re-education**:
        *   Focus on coordinating accessory muscle use (sternocleidomastoid, scalenes) with controlled exhalation.
        *   Provide tactile and verbal cues to encourage any residual diaphragmatic/abdominal movement during inspiration in a semi-Fowler's position.
        *   **Pursed-lip breathing**: To slow respiratory rate and relieve sensations of dyspnea during exertion.
    *   **Thoracic Mobility**: Implement active and active-assisted exercises for chest wall expansion and stretching to improve lung compliance.

#### 2. Swallowing Rehabilitation

*   **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**: Apply surface electrodes to the suprahyoid muscles to facilitate laryngeal elevation and sensory awareness during swallowing exercises.
*   **Therapeutic Exercises**:
    *   **Mendelsohn Maneuver**: To improve and prolong laryngeal elevation and upper esophageal sphincter opening.
    *   **Effortful Swallow**: To increase base of tongue retraction and pharyngeal contraction strength.
    *   **Shaker Exercise (Head Lifts)**: To strengthen the suprahyoid muscle complex.
*   **Sensory Stimulation**: Use thermal-tactile stimulation to the anterior faucial arches prior to swallowing attempts to heighten sensory input and reduce the latency of the swallow trigger.
*   **Dietary Trials & Compensatory Strategies**:
    *   Initiate trials with ice chips and progress to small, controlled boluses of pudding-thick consistency under therapist supervision.
    *   Strictly enforce the **chin-tuck posture** during all swallows to mechanically protect the airway.
    *   Continue primary nutrition via nasogastric tube until oral intake is deemed safe and adequate.

#### 3. Physical Therapy

*   **Cardiovascular Conditioning**:
    *   **Protocol**: Begin with interval training on a recumbent cycle ergometer. Start with 2-3 minute work intervals followed by 1-2 minute rest periods, for a total of 15-20 minutes.
    *   **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2, and patient-reported dyspnea/fatigue (Borg scale). Target heart rate should be maintained at 50-60% of Heart Rate Reserve.
*   **Strength Training**:
    *   **Shoulders (C5 Innervated Muscles)**:
        *   Begin with active-assisted and gravity-eliminated exercises (e.g., tabletop polishing, pendulum exercises).
        *   Incorporate isometric contractions for the deltoids and external rotators.
        *   Apply **NMES** to the right and left deltoids during active contraction attempts to facilitate muscle re-education and hypertrophy.
    *   **General Strengthening**: Progress resistance training for uninvolved muscle groups (core, lower extremities, distal upper extremities) to combat deconditioning.
*   **Mobility & Functional Training**:
    *   **Gait Training**: Focus on increasing speed and endurance on a treadmill and overground.
    *   **Balance Training**: Progress from static to dynamic balance activities, including tandem stance and single-leg stance with support.
    *   **Stair Training**: Practice ascending and descending stairs, focusing on controlled movement and coordinating breathing.
    *   **ADL Retraining**: With Occupational Therapy, simulate and practice ADLs (e.g., dressing, grooming) using adaptive techniques for shoulder weakness and energy conservation principles.

#### 4. Manual Therapy & Other Interventions

*   **Scar Tissue Mobilization**: Perform soft tissue massage and mobilization techniques around the anterior and posterior cervical scars to improve pliability and reduce soft tissue restrictions.
*   **Cervical Spine ROM**: Gentle, active range of motion exercises for the neck within surgeon-specified precautions to prevent stiffness. Avoid passive stretching or mobilization at the fusion site.
*   **Nutritional Support**: Collaborate with a clinical dietitian to ensure the nasogastric feeding formula is calorically dense and high in protein to support muscle synthesis and combat weight loss.
*   **Patient & Family Education**: Provide structured, ongoing education on all aspects of the rehabilitation plan, including a detailed and illustrated Home Exercise Program (HEP) to be performed daily. Emphasize the importance of activity pacing and adherence to swallowing safety precautions.
*   **Psychosocial Support**: Acknowledge the psychological impact of the diagnosis and functional loss. Monitor for signs of anxiety or depression and facilitate a referral to psychology services if indicated. Address sleep hygiene to improve suboptimal sleep.
