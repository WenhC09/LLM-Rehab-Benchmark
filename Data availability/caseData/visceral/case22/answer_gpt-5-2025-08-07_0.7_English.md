# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks)
1. **Respiratory function**:  
   - Improve diaphragmatic activation and thoracoabdominal breathing coordination.  
   - Reduce resting heart rate toward <110 bpm.  
   - Maintain oxygen saturation >95% at rest and during mild activity without supplemental oxygen increase.
2. **Exercise tolerance**:  
   - Ambulate ≥100 m on level ground with Borg dyspnea score ≤3 and HR <140 bpm.  
   - Initiate stair step training with assistance.
3. **Swallowing and speech**:  
   - Reduce aspiration incidence on small-volume water testing.  
   - Improve laryngeal elevation to ≥1.5 cm.  
   - Advance from nasogastric tube to partial oral intake if safe per instrumental assessment.
4. **Upper limb function**:  
   - Increase deltoid strength by at least 0.5–1 MMT grade bilaterally.  
   - Enable active shoulder flexion ≥90° without compensatory trunk movement.
5. **Cervical spine mobility**:  
   - Increase cervical ROM in all planes by ≥10–15° within surgical precautions.
6. **Pain and soft tissue**:  
   - Maintain pain-free shoulder movement; reduce anterior neck scar adhesion and stiffness.
7. **ADL independence**:  
   - Maintain independent ambulation indoors; improve balance to Level 4.

### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
1. **Respiratory function**:  
   - Achieve near-normal diaphragmatic excursion (≥2.5 cm) and thickening fraction ≥20% bilaterally.  
   - Participate in moderate-intensity activities (e.g., walking 500–800 m) without significant dyspnea.
2. **Exercise tolerance**:  
   - Climb one flight of stairs independently without excessive tachycardia.  
   - Return to preoperative community ambulation level.
3. **Swallowing and speech**:  
   - Resume full oral diet without aspiration; remove nasogastric tube.  
   - Achieve intelligible speech for all daily communication needs.
4. **Upper limb function**:  
   - Restore symmetric deltoid strength ≥Grade 4; functional overhead reach for daily tasks.  
   - Return to light upper limb work duties.
5. **Cervical mobility**:  
   - Achieve functional cervical ROM for safe driving, workplace activities, and ADLs.
6. **Participation**:  
   - Return to part-time or full-time work with ergonomic modifications.  
   - Resume social and recreational activities.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Respiratory Rehabilitation
- **Diaphragmatic strengthening**:  
  - Supine and semi-reclined breathing training with manual facilitation and visual feedback (e.g., ultrasound biofeedback if available).  
  - Inspiratory muscle training (threshold device) starting at 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure, progressing gradually.
- **Thoracoabdominal coordination**:  
  - Segmental breathing exercises, pursed-lip breathing during exertion.
- **Secretion clearance**:  
  - Active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) and huff coughing as needed.
- **Aerobic reconditioning**:  
  - Interval ambulation or stationary cycling at low intensity (Borg 2–3), with continuous HR and SpO₂ monitoring.

### B. Cardiopulmonary Endurance Training
- **Low-load, high-frequency walking**:  
  - Start with multiple short bouts (50–100 m), progress distance and pace as tolerated.
- **Stair simulation**:  
  - Step-up training on low platform under supervision, monitoring HR and symptoms.

### C. Swallowing Therapy
- **Direct swallowing training** (if safe):  
  - Effortful swallow, Mendelsohn maneuver, supraglottic swallow.
- **Indirect therapy**:  
  - Thermal–tactile stimulation, Shaker exercise or chin tuck against resistance to improve suprahyoid strength.
- **Diet modification**:  
  - Maintain NG feeding; introduce safe consistencies per repeat swallow assessment (FEES/VFSS).
- **Frequency**:  
  - Daily sessions 20–30 min, with caregiver involvement for home practice.

### D. Speech and Voice Therapy
- **Vocal cord adduction exercises**:  
  - Glottal attack exercises, sustained phonation, pitch glides.  
- **Respiratory–phonatory coordination**:  
  - Reading aloud with breath control training.

### E. Upper Limb Motor Rehabilitation
- **Strengthening**:  
  - Isometric and active-assisted exercises for deltoid, progressing to active and resisted movements.  
  - Scapular stabilization exercises.
- **Neuromuscular re-education**:  
  - Facilitation techniques (PNF patterns for shoulder flexion/abduction).
- **Pain prevention**:  
  - Maintain full passive ROM; avoid heavy resistance until strength improves.

### F. Cervical Spine Mobility & Scar Management
- **Gentle ROM exercises**:  
  - Within surgical safety range, avoiding end-range stress on fixation.  
- **Scar mobilization**:  
  - Cross-fiber massage, silicone gel sheeting if indicated.
- **Postural training**:  
  - Neutral cervical alignment, ergonomic advice for seated activities.

### G. Balance and Functional Training
- **Static and dynamic balance**:  
  - Progress from stable to unstable surfaces; incorporate dual-task training.
- **Functional gait training**:  
  - Incorporate directional changes, obstacle navigation.

### H. Pain Management
- Regular monitoring; use of heat packs, TENS, or gentle stretching as needed.

### I. Nutritional Support
- Collaborate with dietitian:  
  - Optimize caloric/protein intake to support muscle recovery and weight regain.

### J. Psychosocial Support
- Psychological counseling to address anxiety, adjustment, and motivation.  
- Family education on safe mobility assistance, home exercise program.

**Precautions**:
- Monitor for signs of respiratory fatigue (SpO₂ drop >3%, RR >30, HR >85% max).  
- Avoid neck hyperextension/flexion beyond surgical limits.  
- Swallowing training only with therapist supervision until aspiration risk minimized.
