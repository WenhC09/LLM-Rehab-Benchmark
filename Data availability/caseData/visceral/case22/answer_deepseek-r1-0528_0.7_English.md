# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term Goals (0-4 weeks):
- Achieve independent diaphragmatic breathing pattern with visible abdominal excursion
- Increase diaphragmatic excursion to ≥1.5cm bilaterally on ultrasound
- Tolerate oral trials of pureed foods without aspiration
- Improve right deltoid strength to ≥3/5 (manual muscle testing)
- Ambulate 100m at modified Borg scale ≤3/10 dyspnea with HR <130bpm
- Perform basic ADLs with energy conservation techniques

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- Restore independent oral nutrition with regular diet
- Achieve >2.5cm diaphragmatic excursion bilaterally
- Ambulate 500m without supplemental oxygen
- Resume modified work duties
- Independent stair negotiation
- Full shoulder ROM with deltoid strength ≥4/5

## 2. Treatment Methods
### Respiratory Rehabilitation
- **Diaphragmatic Retraining**:  
  • Supine positional release with manual diaphragmatic facilitation  
  • Inspiratory muscle training (Threshold IMT) starting at 30% MIP  
  • Breath stacking maneuvers with visual feedback  
- **Ventilatory Strategy Training**:  
  • Paced breathing during ADLs  
  • Pursed-lip breathing for dyspnea control  
- **Aerobic Conditioning**:  
  • Upright cycle ergometry (start 5min, RPE 3-4) with continuous SpO₂ monitoring  
  • Interval treadmill training with harness support  

### Swallowing/Voice Rehabilitation
- **Pharyngeal Phase Retraining**:  
  • Mendelsohn maneuver with laryngeal elevation facilitation  
  • Thermal-tactile stimulation for swallow initiation  
  • Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) at submental region  
- **Oral Motor Exercises**:  
  • Lingual resistance training  
  • Masako maneuver with biofeedback  
- **Structured Food Trials**:  
  • Progressive texture hierarchy under videofluoroscopy guidance  
  • Strict NPO status until penetration-aspiration scale ≤3  

### Neuromuscular Rehabilitation
- **Deltoid Strengthening**:  
  • Gravity-minimized AAROM (sidelying) → progressive resistance  
  • Neuromuscular re-education with EMG biofeedback  
  • Scapular stabilization drills (serratus anterior facilitation)  
- **Pain Management**:  
  • Anterior cervical scar mobilization (Grade III-IV)  
  • Modalities: TENS over trapezius, moist heat for adhesions  
- **Cervical Mobility**:  
  • Active ROM within fusion precautions (avoid rotation/extension)  
  • Neural gliding techniques for brachial plexus  

### Functional Training
- **Cardiopulmonary Endurance**:  
  • Interval ambulation protocol with HR monitoring (target HR <75% age-predicted max)  
  • Energy conservation education during transfers  
- **Balance Progression**:  
  • Dynamic standing on foam → dual-task training  
- **ADL Simulation**:  
  • Stair negotiation training with handrails  
  • Work simulation tasks (desk ergonomics)  

### Adjunctive Interventions
- **Nutrition Optimization**:  
  • High-calorie NG formula (1.5kcal/ml) with protein supplementation  
  • Weekly anthropometric measurements  
- **Cardiac Monitoring**:  
  • Daily orthostatic vitals, 24h Holter if persistent tachycardia  
- **Psychosocial Support**:  
  • Cognitive-behavioral strategies for activity pacing  
  • Family education on assist techniques
