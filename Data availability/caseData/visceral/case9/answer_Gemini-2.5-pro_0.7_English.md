# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

**Date of Plan Formulation**: September 21, 2020

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4 weeks):
1.  **Airway Clearance**: Achieve independent and effective airway clearance twice daily using prescribed techniques and devices to reduce sputum retention and work of breathing.
2.  **Dyspnea Management**: Reduce mMRC score from 4 to 3 by mastering pursed-lip breathing and diaphragmatic breathing techniques, enabling the patient to perform basic self-care (e.g., washing face, brushing teeth) while seated without severe breathlessness.
3.  **Respiratory Muscle Strength**: Increase Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) from 37 cmH₂O to ≥45 cmH₂O and Maximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP) from 60 cmH₂O to ≥70 cmH₂O.
4.  **Functional Mobility**: Achieve the ability to sit unsupported at the edge of the bed for at least 10 minutes and perform bed-to-wheelchair transfers with minimal assistance, while maintaining SpO₂ ≥90% on supplemental oxygen.
5.  **Psychological Status**: Reduce HAMA score to <20 (mild-moderate anxiety) and HAMD score to <25 (mild-moderate depression) through initial psychological support and relaxation training.
6.  **Nutritional Intake**: Ensure adequate caloric and protein intake as guided by a dietitian to halt further muscle loss.

### Long-term goals (within 3-6 months):
1.  **Exercise Tolerance**: Progress from being wheelchair-bound to ambulating ≥20 meters with a walker and supplemental oxygen, without critical desaturation (SpO₂ <88%).
2.  **Functional Independence**: Improve ADL score from 20 to ≥50, achieving independence in feeding, grooming, and upper body dressing while seated.
3.  **Quality of Life**: Reduce the SGRQ score by a clinically significant margin (≥4 points) by improving physical function and reducing respiratory symptoms.
4.  **Health Maintenance**: Empower the patient and family with knowledge and skills for self-management to reduce the frequency of hospitalizations for acute exacerbations.
5.  **Social Participation**: Enable the patient to leave home for short, planned social or recreational activities via wheelchair.

## 2. Treatment Methods

Given the patient's severe respiratory compromise, high risk of pneumothorax, and profound deconditioning, all interventions will be initiated at very low intensity and frequency, with continuous monitoring of vital signs (especially SpO₂, RR, and HR).

### I. Airway Clearance Therapy
- **Frequency**: 2-3 times daily, especially upon waking and before bedtime.
- **Techniques**:
    - **Oscillating Positive Expiratory Pressure (OPEP) Device (e.g., Acapella, Flutter)**: To mobilize secretions from smaller airways and provide gentle positive pressure. To be performed in a seated, forward-leaning position.
    - **Active Cycle of Breathing Technique (ACBT)**: Modified for patient's tolerance. Emphasis on the Breathing Control and Thoracic Expansion phases, with huffing instead of forceful coughing to reduce risk of pneumothorax and dynamic airway collapse.
    - **Postural Drainage**: Cautiously applied for the right lung segments only, avoiding head-down positions due to GERD. The destroyed left lung will not be targeted. Duration will be limited to 5-10 minutes per position to avoid excessive fatigue.

### II. Respiratory Muscle Training (RMT)
- **Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT)**:
    - **Method**: Use a threshold-loading device.
    - **Protocol**: Start at a low intensity (30% of MIP, ~11 cmH₂O). Perform 2 sessions daily, 5-10 breaths per session, increasing duration and intensity as tolerated. Monitor closely for signs of respiratory muscle fatigue.
- **Diaphragmatic Breathing Training**:
    - **Focus**: Train the functional right hemidiaphragm.
    - **Method**: Patient in a semi-Fowler's position. Use tactile feedback (patient's hand on the right subcostal area) to encourage diaphragmatic excursion. Coordinate with slow, controlled inspiration.
- **Pursed-Lip Breathing**: To be practiced during all activities to reduce dynamic hyperinflation, decrease respiratory rate, and relieve dyspnea.

### III. Therapeutic Exercise & Mobilization
- **Monitoring**: Continuous pulse oximetry and Borg Dyspnea Scale rating. **STOP CRITERIA**: SpO₂ <88%, acute chest pain, severe dyspnea (>7/10 on Borg scale), or extreme fatigue.
- **Supplemental Oxygen**: Titrate flow rate to maintain SpO₂ ≥90% during all therapeutic activities.
- **Phase 1 (Bed-based)**:
    - **Flexibility**: Active-assisted and active range of motion for all extremities to prevent contractures.
    - **Strengthening**: Bed mobility exercises (rolling, bridging), ankle pumps, quadriceps sets, gluteal sets.
- **Phase 2 (Seated)**:
    - **Endurance**: Seated marching, seated bicep curls/shoulder press with no or very light weight (0.5 kg). Start with 1-2 minutes, progressing as tolerated.
    - **Balance**: Practice unsupported sitting at the edge of the bed.
- **Phase 3 (Transfers & Pre-gait)**:
    - **Functional Strength**: Sit-to-stand training from bed/chair with therapist assistance.
    - **Weight-bearing**: Standing tolerance practice in parallel bars or with a walker.

### IV. Energy Conservation & Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training
- **Education**: Teach principles of pacing, planning, and prioritizing activities.
- **Task Modification**:
    - Perform ADLs (grooming, dressing) while seated.
    - Use adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled reacher, sock aid, shower chair).
    - Position supplies within easy reach to minimize effort.
- **Breathing Coordination**: Integrate pursed-lip breathing into all activities.

### V. Nutritional Support
- **Consultation**: Formal consultation with a clinical dietitian is mandatory.
- **Plan**: Implement a high-protein, high-calorie diet with small, frequent meals to reduce dyspnea associated with gastric distention.
- **Supplementation**: Oral nutritional supplements to be used between meals to meet metabolic demands.

### VI. Psychological Intervention
- **Consultation**: Formal consultation with a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist for evaluation and management of anxiety and depression.
- **Therapeutic Techniques**:
    - **Relaxation Training**: Progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery, integrated with diaphragmatic breathing.
    - **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: To address the dyspnea-anxiety-dyspnea cycle and catastrophic thoughts related to breathlessness.
    - **Pharmacotherapy**: Consider initiation of anxiolytic or antidepressant medication under psychiatric guidance.

### VII. Patient and Family Education
- **Disease Management**: Education on ABPA, bronchiectasis, and the importance of medication adherence (corticosteroids, antifungals).
- **Symptom Monitoring**: Teach patient and family to recognize early signs of an exacerbation (e.g., change in sputum color/volume, increased dyspnea, fever).
- **Technique Reinforcement**: Ensure patient and family can correctly demonstrate home exercise program, airway clearance techniques, and proper use of supplemental oxygen.
- **Emergency Plan**: Provide a clear, written action plan for managing acute worsening of symptoms.
