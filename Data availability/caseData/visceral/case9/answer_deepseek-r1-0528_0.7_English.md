# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (0-4 weeks):
- Improve airway clearance: Reduce sputum volume by ≥30% through techniques
- Increase seated tolerance to ≥30 minutes for basic self-care
- Achieve independent bed-chair transfers with supervision
- Reduce dyspnea during ADLs to mMRC grade 3
- Decrease anxiety/depression scores by 20% (HAMA<21, HAMD<26)

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve household ambulation ≥20m with wheeled walker and oxygen
- Improve ADL score to ≥60/100 (modified independence)
- Maintain SpO₂ ≥88% during light ADLs
- Establish sustainable home exercise program
- Reduce SGRQ score to ≤55 (moderate impairment)

## 2. Treatment Methods
### A. Respiratory Rehabilitation
1. **Airway Clearance Techniques**  
   - Postural drainage with percussion (modified for single lung)  
   - Active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) 3x/day  
   - Threshold PEP device (starting at 10 cmH₂O) for 10 min 2x/day  
   - Diaphragmatic re-education: Right hemidiaphragm training in supine  

2. **Ventilatory Muscle Training**  
   - Threshold IMT: 30% MIP (11 cmH₂O) 2 sets of 10 breaths, 2x/day  
   - Pursed-lip breathing with exhalation resistance during ADLs  

3. **Oxygen Optimization**  
   - Titrated O₂ during therapy to maintain SpO₂ 90-94%  
   - Portable concentrator assessment for mobility  

### B. Physical Rehabilitation
1. **Bed Mobility & Transfers**  
   - Energy conservation techniques for repositioning  
   - Transfer training with sliding board → pivot transfer progression  

2. **Strength & Conditioning**  
   - Seated upper limb ergometry: 5 min sessions, RPE ≤3/10  
   - Non-resisted AROM exercises 3x/day (emphasis on scapular stabilizers)  
   - Quad sets and ankle pumps for DVT prophylaxis  

3. **Functional Mobility**  
   - Standing tolerance training at parallel bars (O₂-supported)  
   - Wheelchair propulsion technique training  

### C. Psychosocial Support
1. **Psychological Intervention**  
   - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) 2x/week for illness adjustment  
   - Relaxation training: Guided imagery for dyspnea management  

2. **Patient Education**  
   - Disease-specific education: ABPA triggers and early warning signs  
   - Energy expenditure budgeting for photography equipment use  

### D. Nutritional Management
- High-protein oral nutritional supplements (1.5g/kg/day)  
- Postural strategies for GERD management during feeding  
- Weekly weight monitoring with corticosteroid nutrition counseling  

### E. Monitoring & Safety
- Continuous pulse oximetry during all therapeutic activities  
- Borg Dyspnea Scale documentation pre/post sessions  
- Fall risk protocol implementation (bed alarm, non-slip footwear)  
- Bi-weekly reassessment of MIP/MEP and diaphragmatic ultrasound
