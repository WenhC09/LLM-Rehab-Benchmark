# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks)
- **Respiratory function**: Reduce dyspnea severity from mMRC grade 4 toward grade 3 by optimizing breathing patterns and airway clearance.
- **Secretion management**: Improve sputum expectoration efficiency to reduce infection risk.
- **Oxygenation**: Maintain SpO₂ ≥ 90% at rest and during minimal activity with optimized supplemental oxygen.
- **Muscle strength**: Prevent further decline in respiratory and peripheral muscle strength through low-intensity, tolerance-based exercises.
- **ADL**: Achieve partial independence in basic self-care (e.g., feeding, grooming) with adaptive aids.
- **Psychological status**: Reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms via psychological support and relaxation techniques.
- **Nutrition**: Stabilize weight and prevent further muscle mass loss through nutritional support.

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months)
- **Functional capacity**: Increase activity tolerance to enable basic indoor ambulation with assistive devices while maintaining adequate oxygenation.
- **Respiratory mechanics**: Maximize use of intact right diaphragm and accessory respiratory muscles to compensate for left paralysis.
- **Infection control**: Reduce frequency and severity of pulmonary exacerbations via airway clearance, self-management education, and early intervention strategies.
- **ADL independence**: Achieve maximal possible independence in daily activities, minimizing caregiver burden.
- **Quality of life**: Improve SGRQ score by ≥ 10 points.
- **Psychosocial adaptation**: Enhance coping strategies, social participation, and self-management confidence.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Respiratory Rehabilitation
1. **Airway Clearance Techniques**
   - Daily use of oscillatory positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) device or PEP mask (2–3 sessions/day).
   - Active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) with emphasis on forced expiration and huff coughing.
   - Postural drainage adapted to patient’s tolerance and oxygenation status, avoiding head-down positions due to GERD.

2. **Breathing Exercises**
   - Pursed-lip breathing and diaphragmatic breathing training focused on right hemidiaphragm activation.
   - Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) with threshold device starting at 30% MIP, progressing as tolerated.
   - Avoid excessive fatigue; monitor SpO₂ and heart rate during sessions.

3. **Oxygen Therapy**
   - Continue long-term home oxygen therapy.
   - Adjust flow to maintain SpO₂ ≥ 90% at rest and during activity.
   - Educate patient on safe oxygen use during mobility and airway clearance.

### B. Physical Training
1. **Bed-based and Seated Exercises**
   - Passive-to-active range-of-motion exercises for all limbs to prevent contractures and maintain joint mobility.
   - Seated marching, arm ergometry, and light resistance training with TheraBands for upper limbs to maintain muscle mass.

2. **Gradual Mobilization**
   - Progressive upright tolerance: bed reclining → seated in wheelchair → standing with support if SpO₂ stable.
   - Monitor vitals closely; stop if SpO₂ < 88% despite oxygen optimization.

---

### C. Nutritional Support
- Diet rich in high-quality protein and adequate calories to prevent muscle wasting.
- Small, frequent meals to reduce postprandial dyspnea.
- Coordinate with dietitian to address nutritional risk (NRS 3) and monitor weight weekly.

---

### D. Psychological Support
- Regular psychological counseling sessions to address anxiety (HAMA 26) and depression (HAMD 32).
- Teach relaxation techniques (guided imagery, breathing relaxation).
- Engage family/caregiver in supportive communication strategies.

---

### E. Education & Self-Management
- Instruction on correct inhaler technique (if prescribed).
- Early recognition of exacerbation signs and prompt medical contact.
- Avoidance of allergens (Aspergillus fumigatus, dust mites, animal proteins) through environmental control measures.

---

### F. Complication Prevention
- Pressure sore prevention: regular repositioning, skin care.
- Fall prevention: safe transfer training, use of assistive devices.
- GERD management: avoid late-night meals, elevate head of bed, coordinate with physician for pharmacologic control.

---

### G. Multidisciplinary Coordination
- Close collaboration between respiratory physician, rehabilitation team, nutritionist, and psychologist.
- Regular reassessment of respiratory status, exercise tolerance, and psychological well-being every 2–4 weeks.
