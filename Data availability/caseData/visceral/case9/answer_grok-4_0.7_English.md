# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (1-3 months):
- **Improve Respiratory Function**: Increase maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) by 10-15% and right hemidiaphragm excursion by 0.5 cm to enhance breathing efficiency.
- **Reduce Dyspnea**: Lower mMRC Dyspnea Scale score from Grade 4 to Grade 3, enabling basic self-care activities like dressing with minimal breathlessness.
- **Enhance Exercise Tolerance**: Achieve ability to perform a modified 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) with supplemental oxygen, targeting a distance of 50-100 meters without desaturation below 88%.
- **Improve Nutritional Status**: Reduce Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) score to ≤2 through dietary optimization and weight stabilization.
- **Address Psychological Distress**: Reduce Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) score to <20 and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score to <25 through psychological support and relaxation techniques.
- **Increase ADL Independence**: Improve ADL score to 30-40, enabling partial independence in basic self-care tasks.

### Long-term Goals (3-12 months):
- **Optimize Respiratory Muscle Function**: Achieve MIP ≥50 cmH₂O and MEP ≥80 cmH₂O, with improved right hemidiaphragm thickening fraction to >90%.
- **Further Reduce Dyspnea**: Reach mMRC Dyspnea Scale score of Grade 2, allowing light household activities with moderate exertion.
- **Enhance Functional Capacity**: Complete a 6MWT with a distance of 150-200 meters on supplemental oxygen, maintaining oxygen saturation ≥90%.
- **Achieve Nutritional Stability**: Maintain stable weight (target 62-65 kg) and eliminate nutritional risk (NRS-2002 score ≤1).
- **Improve Psychological Well-being**: Reduce HAMA score to <14 (mild anxiety) and HAMD score to <17 (mild depression), supporting emotional resilience.
- **Maximize ADL and Social Participation**: Achieve ADL score ≥60, enabling independence in most daily activities, and improve social engagement through participation in low-intensity community activities.
- **Enhance Quality of Life**: Reduce St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score to <50, reflecting improved health-related quality of life.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Respiratory Rehabilitation
- **Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT)**: Use a threshold inspiratory muscle trainer at 30% of MIP (initially 11 cmH₂O), 15 minutes twice daily, 5 days/week. Gradually increase resistance by 5-10% every 2 weeks as tolerated, aiming to strengthen respiratory muscles and improve inspiratory drive.
- **Diaphragmatic Breathing**: Perform diaphragmatic breathing with visual biofeedback (using a mirror or ultrasound guidance if available) for 10 minutes, 3 times daily, to enhance right hemidiaphragm excursion and compensate for left hemidiaphragm paralysis.
- **Pursed-Lip Breathing**: Practice pursed-lip breathing for 5-10 minutes, 4 times daily, to reduce respiratory rate, prolong exhalation, and alleviate dyspnea.
- **Airway Clearance Techniques**: Implement active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) with chest physiotherapy (postural drainage and percussion) 2-3 times daily to manage bronchiectasis-related secretions and prevent infections. Use a positive expiratory pressure (PEP) device (e.g., Acapella) for 10 minutes twice daily to enhance mucus clearance.
- **Oxygen Therapy Optimization**: Continue long-term home oxygen therapy, titrating flow to maintain SpO₂ ≥90% at rest and during activity. Use a portable oxygen concentrator for mobility during rehabilitation exercises.

### Physical Rehabilitation
- **Upper Limb Strength Training**: Perform seated resistance exercises (e.g., shoulder presses, bicep curls with 0.5-1 kg weights) for 10-15 minutes, 3-4 times/week, to improve upper body strength and support respiratory muscle function. Start with 1 set of 8-10 repetitions, progressing to 2 sets as tolerated.
- **Lower Limb Endurance Training**: Initiate seated leg exercises (e.g., leg extensions, ankle pumps) for 10 minutes, 3 times/week, using body weight or light resistance bands. Progress to standing exercises (e.g., partial squats) when 6MWT becomes feasible.
- **Balance and Mobility Training**: Conduct seated balance exercises (e.g., reaching tasks) for 10 minutes daily to enhance trunk stability. Transition to standing balance exercises with support (e.g., holding a chair) when dyspnea improves to mMRC Grade 3.
- **Modified Aerobic Training**: Begin with interval training (e.g., 1-minute seated arm ergometry with 2-minute rest) for 10-15 minutes, 3 times/week, with supplemental oxygen. Gradually increase duration and intensity based on oxygen saturation and dyspnea levels.

### Nutritional Support
- **Dietary Counseling**: Collaborate with a dietitian to design a high-calorie, high-protein diet (target 30-35 kcal/kg/day, 1.2-1.5 g protein/kg/day) to address nutritional risk and support weight gain. Include small, frequent meals to minimize GERD symptoms and avoid allergens (egg white, beef, mutton).
- **Supplementation**: Initiate oral nutritional supplements (e.g., high-calorie shakes) if oral intake is insufficient, targeting an additional 300-500 kcal/day.
- **GERD Management**: Elevate head of bed during sleep, avoid meals 2-3 hours before bedtime, and continue prescribed proton pump inhibitors to reduce reflux-related respiratory irritation.

### Psychological and Social Support
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Engage in weekly 30-minute CBT sessions with a psychologist to address anxiety and depression, focusing on coping strategies for chronic illness and dyspnea-related fear.
- **Relaxation Techniques**: Practice guided mindfulness or progressive muscle relaxation for 10-15 minutes daily to reduce HAMA and HAMD scores.
- **Social Engagement**: Encourage participation in virtual support groups for chronic lung disease patients, starting with 1 session/week, to improve social participation and reduce isolation.

### ADL and Functional Training
- **Occupational Therapy**: Work with an occupational therapist for 30-minute sessions, 3 times/week, focusing on energy conservation techniques and adaptive equipment (e.g., shower chair, long-handled tools) to improve ADL independence.
- **Task-Specific Training**: Practice basic self-care tasks (e.g., dressing, grooming) with rest breaks and supplemental oxygen, progressing from seated to standing tasks as exercise tolerance improves.

### Monitoring and Follow-Up
- **Weekly Assessments**: Monitor MIP, MEP, mMRC score, and oxygen saturation weekly to adjust IMT and exercise intensity.
- **Monthly Evaluations**: Reassess ADL score, HAMA, HAMD, and NRS-2002 score to track progress toward short-term goals.
- **Quarterly Comprehensive Review**: Repeat SGRQ and diaphragm ultrasound to evaluate long-term respiratory and quality-of-life improvements.
- **Multidisciplinary Coordination**: Regular consultation with pulmonologist, dietitian, psychologist, and occupational therapist to ensure integrated care, adjusting plan based on clinical status (e.g., infection control, medication side effects).

### Precautions
- **Infection Control**: Strict adherence to airway clearance and hand hygiene to prevent exacerbation of bronchiectasis or ABPA. Avoid environments with high allergen exposure (e.g., dust mites, mold).
- **Oxygen Safety**: Ensure proper handling of oxygen equipment to prevent desaturation during activities.
- **Exercise Limits**: Stop exercises if SpO₂ <88% or dyspnea worsens significantly. Avoid overexertion due to pulmonary hypertension.
- **Allergy Management**: Avoid known allergens in diet and environment to prevent ABPA flares.
