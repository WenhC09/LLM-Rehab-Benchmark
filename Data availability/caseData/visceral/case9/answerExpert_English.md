# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-term Goals:
*   Alleviate patient's anxiety and fear.
*   Reduce dyspnea during activities and moderate-to-high intensity exertion.
*   Master effective sputum clearance techniques to alleviate cough and expectoration.
*   Improve respiratory muscle function.
*   Correct negative nutritional status.
*   Achieve early out-of-bed mobilization and ultimately attain complete independence in activities of daily living (ADL).

#### Long-term Goals:
*   Relieve symptoms such as dyspnea and reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations.
*   Enhance overall physical fitness and improve cardiopulmonary function.
*   Improve quality of life, facilitate reintegration into family and society, and enable participation in partial work activities.
*   Prolong life expectancy.

### 2. Treatment Methods

The patient's rehabilitation adheres to the principles of early intervention, gradual progression, dynamic adjustment, and multidisciplinary collaboration. Under the premise of infection control, nutritional support, and psychological intervention, the specific rehabilitation strategy is divided into two in-hospital phases and a post-discharge home-based rehabilitation program.

**Patient Education and Psychological Intervention**
Educate the patient about their disease, thoroughly explain the significance, specific methods, and risk prevention during respiratory rehabilitation to build confidence. Utilize Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), combining reverse stimulation (informing about hazards of prolonged bed rest) and positive encouragement (sharing successful similar cases). Encourage objective symptom tracking (e.g., diary) to alleviate anxiety and depression, enhancing treatment adherence.

**Airway Clearance and Sputum Expectoration Training**
Employ integrated techniques for effective secretion clearance:
*   **Pharmacological Assistance:** Administer nebulized medication pre-treatment to humidify airways and thin sputum.
*   **Physical Assistance:** Combine postural drainage with chest percussion or utilize a high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) vest for passive clearance.
*   **Active Techniques:** Instruct the patient in mastering and applying the Active Cycle of Breathing Technique (ACBT) and Oscillatory Positive Expiratory Pressure (OPEP) therapy for independent, efficient airway clearance.

**Breathing Pattern and Respiratory Muscle Training**
*   **Breathing Pattern Training:** Train the patient in diaphragmatic breathing combined with pursed-lip breathing. Initial inspiratory-to-expiratory (I:E) ratio is 1:3, adjusting to 1:2 during aerobic exercise. Instruct on energy conservation breathing techniques during daily activities. Strictly prohibit the Valsalva maneuver.
*   **Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT):** In Phase 2, initiate inspiratory muscle resistance training at 50% of Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) (i.e., 19 cmH₂O). Perform 30 inspirations per session, twice daily, with daily intensity increments of 1 cmH₂O.
*   **Diaphragmatic Function Training:** Utilize an external diaphragm pacemaker for electrical stimulation at the maximum tolerable intensity (without inducing neck muscle rigidity). Set respiratory rate at 18 breaths/minute, inspiratory time 1.1 seconds, expiratory time 2.2 seconds. Administer 30 minutes per session, twice daily.

**Physical Fitness and Aerobic Exercise Training**
*   **Phase 1 (Early Low-Intensity Training):**
    *   **Bed-based Resistance Training:** Perform limb strengthening exercises using elastic resistance bands.
    *   **Bedside Aerobics:** Conduct low-intensity bedside cycling for 20 minutes per session.
*   **Phase 2 (Progressive Moderate-to-High Intensity Training):**
    *   **Seated Cycling:** Perform aerobic training for 20 minutes/day, including 3-minute warm-up and cool-down periods. Start resistance at 30% of maximum intensity, increasing by 10% weekly, targeting 70% intensity. Provide supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 L/min if SpO₂ falls below 88% during exercise to ensure safety and efficacy.

**Early Mobilization and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training**
*   **Early Mobilization:** Guide the patient through basic activities: rolling over, sitting up in bed, bed-to-chair transfers, and standing at bedside, progressively increasing mobility range.
*   **ADL Training:** As function improves, implement ambulation training with supplemental oxygen. Emphasize energy conservation techniques during daily tasks (e.g., washing face, dressing, putting on shoes, bathing, eating, toileting) using labor-saving postures and methods to minimize unnecessary energy expenditure.

**Home-Based Rehabilitation and Self-Management Program**
*   **Self-Management:** Instruct the patient post-discharge on personal protection, dietary control, and allergen avoidance. Maintain daily independent sputum clearance (nebulization + postural drainage + percussion + ACBT).
*   **Home Exercise Program:**
    *   **Elastic Band Exercises:** 2-3 times/week, 30 minutes/session.
    *   **Cycling Training:** 3-5 times/week, 20 minutes/session (excluding warm-up/cool-down). Target heart rate: 140 bpm.
    *   **Functional Activities:** Encourage active participation in household chores (e.g., cooking, making dumplings) to integrate rehabilitation into daily life.
*   **Safety Monitoring and Termination Criteria:** Monitor heart rate and SpO₂ during exercise. Terminate immediately if SpO₂ < 85%, Borg CR10 Scale Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) > 4, or severe subjective discomfort occurs.
*   **Remote Management:** Provide remote guidance and supervision via online platforms to ensure quality and safety of home-based rehabilitation.
