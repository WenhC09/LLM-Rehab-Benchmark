# Medical Record Information

## I. Clinical Summary

**Patient**: Male, 48 years old.

**Chief Complaint**: Recurrent fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath for nearly 3 months, aggravated for 1 week.

**Present Illness**: On July 1, 2020 (3 months ago), the patient developed cough with yellow purulent sputum, fever, and shortness of breath after exertion, with a maximum temperature of 38°C and occasional wheezing. Self-medication and treatment at external hospitals were attempted. Anti-infective therapy was initiated at our hospital on July 7, 2020, with subjective improvement in shortness of breath and cough, but intermittent fever and yellow sputum persisted. Follow-up chest X-ray showed aggravated pulmonary infection, prompting antibiotic change and addition of antifungal therapy. Antifungal medication was later changed due to rash. Treatment with "prednisone acetate + voriconazole" began on July 25, 2020, resulting in normalization of body temperature and significant improvement in cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath. Outpatient monitoring showed decreased serum IgE levels. Prednisone was switched to methylprednisolone due to elevated liver transaminases. On September 16, 2020, the patient experienced increased sputum production and significantly worsened exertional dyspnea without clear triggers, leading to hospital admission. Since onset, the patient has had poor mental status. Appetite significantly improved after corticosteroid initiation. Poor sleep. Normal bowel and bladder function. Weight gain of approximately 10 kg (current weight: 60 kg).

**Past Medical History**: Frail since childhood, frequent visits for "respiratory infections." Experienced 7-8 episodes of "spontaneous pneumothorax" between 1987 and 1997. Chest CT in 1998 showed "left bronchiectasis"; surgical recommendation declined. Sputum culture in 2001 indicated *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. Underwent "thoracoscopic left lower lobectomy" for "bronchiectasis" on October 31, 2012. Symptoms recurred in 2018; sputum culture identified *Mycobacterium szulgai*, with regular anti-infective therapy for 1 year. Experienced 4 episodes of "right spontaneous pneumothorax" in 2019, all improved with closed thoracic drainage. Diagnosed with "chronic lung disease-associated pulmonary hypertension" in 2019, requiring long-term home oxygen therapy. History of "gastroesophageal reflux disease." Allergy to contrast agent "Ioversol"; multiple allergen sensitization (egg white, beef, mutton, *Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus*, *Dermatophagoides farinae*, *Aspergillus fumigatus*).

**Personal History**: Born in Shenyang, Liaoning Province. Long-term residence in Beijing. Occupation: Field photography/documentary work. No special exposures. Non-smoker, non-drinker, no illicit drug use.

**Marital and Reproductive History**: Unmarried, no children. Previous sperm motility test indicated reduced motility.

**Family History**: Maternal grandmother had cor pulmonale. Paternal grandmother had "asthma." Cousin underwent lung surgery for "bronchiectasis."

**Physical Examination**: T 36.4°C, P 104 bpm, R 26 bpm, BP 114/71 mmHg. Poor nutritional status. Wheelchair-bound. Alert, speech fragmented, tachypneic. Left chest wall collapse, reduced left respiratory movement, narrowed left intercostal spaces, diminished tactile fremitus. Dull percussion note over right lung; impaired percussion note over left lower lung. Coarse breath sounds in right lung; moist rales audible in upper right lung fields; wheezes audible in lower right lung fields; tubular breath sounds and sparse moist rales audible in left upper lung fields. Heart rate 104 bpm, regular rhythm, no murmurs. No limb deformities. Digital clubbing present. No lower extremity edema.

**Auxiliary Examination**: Chest CT: Destruction of left upper lobe with multiple cavities; status post left lower lobectomy; right-sided bronchiectasis; multiple emphysematous bullae in right lower lobe.

**Disease Diagnoses**:
1.  Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA);
2.  Bronchiectasis with Infection;
3.  Destroyed Left Upper Lobe with Multiple Cavities;
4.  Status Post Left Lower Lobectomy;
5.  Compensatory Emphysema of Right Lung;
6.  Chronic Lung Disease-Associated Pulmonary Hypertension;
7.  Sinus Tachycardia;
8.  Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).

**Functional Diagnoses**:
1.  Respiratory Dysfunction;
2.  Reduced Exercise Tolerance;
3.  Impaired Activities of Daily Living (ADL);
4.  Impaired Social Participation.

## II. Pre-Rehabilitation Quantitative Assessments

Respiratory rehabilitation function assessments were performed prior to initiating rehabilitation therapy, with the following results:

1.  **Pulmonary Function**: Testing not feasible. Reference most recent results: FEV₁ 20.5%, FEV₁/FVC 36.7%, DLCO SB 63.2%. Indicates very severe obstructive ventilatory defect with reduced diffusing capacity.
2.  **Dyspnea Severity**: Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale Grade 4, indicating severe dyspnea preventing dressing or leaving bed.
3.  **Respiratory Muscle Function**: Impaired respiratory muscle function. Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP): 37 cmH₂O; Maximum Expiratory Pressure (MEP): 60 cmH₂O. Diaphragm Ultrasound: Left hemidiaphragm paralysis; Right hemidiaphragm excursion: 3.1 cm; Left hemidiaphragm thickness: 0.12 cm; Right hemidiaphragm thickness: 0.15 cm; Left hemidiaphragm thickening fraction: 0%; Right hemidiaphragm thickening fraction: 80%. Indicates reduced inspiratory drive, diaphragmatic paralysis, and reduced diaphragmatic mobility.
4.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL)**: Score 20. Complete dependence for all functions except normal bowel and bladder function.
5.  **Exercise Tolerance**: 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) not performed due to severe dyspnea and low oxygen saturation.
6.  **Psychological Status**: Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) score: 26; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score: 32. Indicates significant anxiety and moderate depression.
7.  **Nutritional Status**: Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) score: 3, indicating nutritional risk.
8.  **Quality of Life**: St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score: 69, indicating severely impaired health-related quality of life.
