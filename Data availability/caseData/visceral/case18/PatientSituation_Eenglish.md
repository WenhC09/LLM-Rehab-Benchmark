### Case Information

#### I. Medical Summary

*   **Basic Information**: Male, 65 years old.
*   **Chief Complaint**: Elevated blood glucose for 15 years, numbness in both lower legs and feet for 2 years.
*   **Present Illness**: The patient was found to have elevated fasting blood glucose during a physical examination 15 years ago (fasting blood glucose 8 mmol/L). Diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus was confirmed via Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) (2-hour postprandial blood glucose 14 mmol/L). At that time, dietary control and moderate exercise were initiated, along with oral Metformin and Acarbose therapy. During this period, the patient adhered to medication regularly but did not monitor blood glucose regularly. Two years ago, the patient developed numbness in both lower legs and feet, initially occurring occasionally at night. In the past six months, the symptoms have persisted and are accompanied by waking up from numbness pain at night. No limb weakness, no skin ulceration. No special dietary habits, normal bowel and bladder function. Weight gain of approximately 5 kg over the past year.
*   **Past Medical History**: History of hypertension for 15 years, history of coronary artery disease for 5 years. No family history of diabetes. No history of smoking or alcohol consumption.

#### II. Pre-Rehabilitation Quantitative Assessments

##### Physical Examination

*   **Vital Signs**: Temperature 37.1°C, Pulse 88 bpm, Respiratory rate 17 bpm, Blood pressure 155/95 mmHg.
*   **General Examination**: Walked into the ward independently. Clear breath sounds bilaterally, no dry or moist rales heard. Cardiac percussion shows no enlargement of heart borders, heart rate 88 bpm, normal heart sounds, no significant murmurs in any valve areas. Abdomen soft, no tenderness, liver and spleen not palpable below the costal margin, bowel sounds not hyperactive.
*   **Specialized Examination**:
    *   **Circulation and Edema**: No edema in both lower limbs, dorsalis pedis artery pulses symmetric bilaterally.
    *   **Muscle Strength and Sensation**: No significant abnormalities in muscle strength of all limbs. Decreased temperature and pain sensation in a stocking distribution over the lower third of both calves and feet, decreased vibration sensation at both ankles.
    *   **Reflexes**: Knee reflexes slightly diminished bilaterally, Babinski sign negative.
*   **Quantitative Assessments**:
    *   **Anthropometric Measurements**: Waist circumference 95 cm, Body Mass Index (BMI) 29.
    *   **Functional Assessment**: Modified Barthel Index score for Activities of Daily Living is 100 points.
    *   **Pain Assessment**: Numbness discomfort in both lower legs and feet, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score 4.

##### Ancillary Investigations

*   **Laboratory Tests**:
    *   **Renal Function**: Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) 6 mmol/L, Creatinine 66 μmol/L.
    *   **Lipid Profile**: Triglycerides 5.38 mmol/L, Total Cholesterol 5.15 mmol/L, Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) 3.6 mmol/L, High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) 1.2 mmol/L.
    *   **Blood Glucose**: Fasting blood glucose 8.2 mmol/L, Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.1%.
    *   **Urinalysis**: Glucosuria (++), no other significant abnormalities.
*   **Echocardiography**: Normal chamber sizes, no left ventricular wall thickening, no significant reduction in left ventricular systolic function at rest; no significant abnormalities in mitral or tricuspid valves. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) 70%.
*   **Nerve Conduction Velocity and Electromyography (EMG)**: Reduced amplitude of sensory potentials in bilateral tibial, common peroneal, and sural nerves, slowed conduction velocity. Tibial nerve F-wave latency >58 ms. No significant denervation potentials in related muscle groups of the lower limbs.
*   **Fundoscopy**: Diabetic Retinopathy Stage 1.

#### III. Admission Diagnosis

*   **Disease Diagnoses**:
    1.  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with Peripheral Neuropathy
    2.  Coronary Artery Disease (Atherosclerotic)
    3.  Hypertension Stage 2 (High Risk)
    4.  Hyperlipidemia
*   **Functional Diagnosis**: Limb numbness.
