# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals:
 Reduce numbness and discomfort in both lower legs and feet (target NRS score ≤2 within 4–6 weeks).
- Improve glycemic controltarget HbA1c <70% and fasting blood glucose.0 mmol/L within 3 months).
- Enhance cardiovascular risk management by optimizing blood pressure (target <140/90 mmHg and lipid profile (target LDL <2.6 mmol/L, triglycerides.7 mmol/L within 3 months).
- Maintain current functional independence (Modified Barthel Index score of 100).

###-term Goals:
- Prevent progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and maintain improve sensory function.
- Achieve and sustain optimal weight management ( BMI 25–27 within 6–12 months).
- Reduce risk of cardiovascular events through sustained pressure and lipid control.
- Enhance overall physical endurance and quality life, enabling consistent participation in daily activities without symptom exacerbation.
## 2. Treatment Methods
### a. Medical Management
- **Glycemic Control**: Continue Metformin and Acarb as prescribed, with regular of fasting blood glucose (weekly) and HbA1c ( 3 months). Refer to endocrologist for potential addition of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP- receptor agonists, considering cardiovascular benefits and weight management.
-Neuropathic Symptom Management**: Initiate Pregabalin (starting dose 75 mg twice daily, titrate 150 mg twice daily as tolerated) to address numbness and neuropathic pain. Monitor for side effects such as drowsiness or edema.
- **Cardiovascular Risk Management**:
  - Continue antihypertensive therapy (e.g., ACE inhibitor or ARB as prescribed) to achieve blood pressure <140/90 mm, with biweekly monitoring.
  - Initiate statin therapy (e., Atorvastatin 20 mg daily) to target LDL <2.6 mmol/L and triglycerides <1.7 mmol/L, with lipid recheck in 6 weeks.
- **Nutritional Counseling**: Collaborate with a dietitian to develop a low-glycemic, heart-health diet plan. Emphasize portion control, reduced refined carbohydrates, and increased fiber intake (target 25–30 g/day). Address weight gain with a caloric deficit of 500 kcal/day to achieve gradual weight loss (0.5–1 kg/month).

### b. Physical Therapy
- **Aerobic Exercise**: Initiate a supervised aerobic exercise (e.g., stationary cycling or brisk walking) for 30 minutes 5 days/week at moderate intensity (50–70% of maximum rate, approximately 110–130 bpm based on age). Monitor pressure and heart rate during sessions to ensure cardiovascular safety.
-Sensory Retraining**: Implement stimulation exercises (e.g., textured surface walking, vibration therapy for 15–20 minutes daily improve sensory perception in the lower.
- **Balance Training**: Perform balance exercises (e.g standing on one leg, heel-to-toe walking) for–15 minutes, 3–4 times/week to enhance proprioception and reduce fall risk due to sensory deficits.
- **Foot Care Education**: Provide training on daily foot inspection, footwear, and moisturizing to prevent skin breakdown, given diabetic neuropathy risk of ulceration.

### c. Pain and Symptom Management- **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)**: TENS to both lower legs for 30 minutes, 3–5/week to reduce numbness and neuropathic discomfort.
- **Thermal Therapy Use warm (not hot) compresses on lower limbs for minutes daily to improve local circulation and alleviate numbness, ensuring skin temperature remains <40°C to avoid burns.

### d. Lifestyle and Behavioral Interventions
- **Blood Glucose Monitoring**:ate patient on consistent self-monitoring of blood glucose (fasting and-hour postprandial) using a glucometer, targeting glucose <7.0 mmol/L and postprandial <10.0/L.
- **Weight Management**: Encourage gradual weight loss through dietary and exercise interventions, targeting a 5–10% reduction body weight over 6–12 months.
- **Smoking Alcohol**: Reinforce continued abstinence from smoking and alcohol to minimize cardiovascular neuropathic risks.

### e. Psychological Support
-Education and Counseling**: Provide psychoeducation on diabetes management and neuropathy to anxiety and improve adherence to treatment Offer group or individual counseling sessions to address any emotional distress related to chronic symptoms.
- **ivational Interviewing**: Use motivational interviewing techniques during follow-ups to enhance patient in lifestyle changes and adherence to therapy.

### f. and Follow-Up
- **Weekly Monitoring**: Assess NRS score, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels during therapy sessions to track progress and adjust interventions.
- **Monthly Follow-Up**: Re-evaluate sensory function (vibration and temperature sensation reflexes, and functional status (Modified Barthel Index).
-Quarterly Assessments**: Repeat HbA1c, lipid profile, and nerve conduction studies (if indicated) to monitor disease progression and efficacy.
- **Multidisciplinary Collaboration**: Coordinate with endocrin, cardiologist, and dietitian for integrated management of diabetes hypertension, and coronary artery disease.

This plan is tailored the patient’s current condition, focusing on symptom relief, risk factor, and functional preservation, with adjustments based on ongoing monitoring and to interventions.
