### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

#### 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
   **Short-term goals:**
   - Improve sensory perception in bilateral lower legs and feet.
   - Reduce numbness discomfort from a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score of 4/10 to 2/10 within 4 weeks.
   - Educate the patient on blood glucose monitoring and dietary management to stabilize blood glucose levels.

   **Long-term goals:**
   - Achieve and maintain HbA1c levels below 7% within 3 months.
   - Enhance overall functional mobility and independence, maintaining a Modified Barthel Index score of 100/100.
   - Improve cardiovascular health and manage hypertension to achieve a blood pressure of <140/90 mmHg within 6 months.

#### 2. Treatment Methods:
   - **Education and Self-Management:**
     - Provide education on diabetes management, including the importance of regular blood glucose monitoring and dietary modifications.
     - Develop a personalized meal plan focusing on low glycemic index foods and weight management strategies.

   - **Physical Therapy:**
     - Initiate a structured exercise program focusing on low-impact aerobic activities (e.g., walking, cycling) to improve cardiovascular fitness and promote weight loss.
     - Incorporate balance and proprioceptive training exercises to enhance lower limb stability and reduce fall risk.

   - **Pain Management:**
     - Implement a pain management strategy that may include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain.
     - Consider pharmacological options such as gabapentin or pregabalin if pain persists despite non-pharmacological interventions.

   - **Nutritional Support:**
     - Refer to a dietitian for comprehensive dietary counseling to address hyperlipidemia and diabetes management.
     - Monitor lipid levels and adjust dietary recommendations as necessary to achieve target lipid profiles.

   - **Regular Monitoring:**
     - Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor blood glucose levels, HbA1c, blood pressure, and lipid profiles.
     - Assess progress towards rehabilitation goals and adjust the treatment plan as needed based on patient response and adherence.

   - **Multidisciplinary Approach:**
     - Collaborate with endocrinologists, cardiologists, and dietitians to ensure comprehensive management of diabetes, cardiovascular health, and nutritional needs.
