### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

**Short-term Goals:**
*   Alleviate bilateral lower limb numbness and discomfort; reduce Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain score; improve sleep disturbances caused by nocturnal numbness and pain.
*   Achieve initial stabilization and reduction of blood glucose and blood pressure levels.
*   Establish and initiate an individualized diet and exercise plan to preliminarily control weight gain trend.

**Long-term Goals:**
*   Effectively control blood glucose (fasting and postprandial), blood pressure, and blood lipids to achieve optimal glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.
*   Correct obesity (reduce Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference); eliminate or reduce risk factors for poor diabetes prognosis.
*   Prevent or delay the progression of diabetes-related complications (e.g., peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy).
*   Enhance the patient's self-management ability regarding the disease; establish and maintain a healthy lifestyle including diet, exercise, and foot care.

### 2. Treatment Methods

**Diet Therapy:**
Based on the patient's ideal body weight and sedentary work nature, a daily total caloric intake of 2000 kcal is prescribed. Macronutrient distribution adheres to the following principles: Carbohydrates provide 50%-60% of total energy; Protein intake is calculated at 0.8-1.2g per kg of body weight, providing approximately 15% of energy; Considering the patient's hypercholesterolemia, dietary fat intake is specifically reduced to provide no more than 15% of total energy. Daily calories are distributed across three meals in a ratio of 1/5 for breakfast, 2/5 for lunch, and 2/5 for dinner.

**Exercise Therapy:**
An aerobic exercise-centered regimen is prescribed.
*   **Exercise Modality:** Primarily sustained exercises engaging large muscle groups, specifically treadmill brisk walking and stationary cycling.
*   **Exercise Intensity:** Monitored using heart rate, with a target range of 110-120 beats per minute.
*   **Exercise Duration:** 45 minutes per session.
*   **Exercise Frequency:** Daily, 7 days per week.

**Physical Therapy:**
For bilateral lower limb numbness, the following physical agent modalities are applied:
*   **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) Therapy:** Applied to the tibial and common peroneal nerve innervation areas of both lower limbs to alleviate neuropathic pain and numbness. Frequency: Once daily, 5 times per week.
*   **Whole-Body Vibration Therapy:** Administered using a vibration platform to improve lower limb sensory function and alleviate pain. Frequency: Once daily, 3 times per week.

**Pharmacotherapy:**
To complement rehabilitation and synergistically control physiological parameters, the medication regimen includes:
*   **Glucose-Lowering Therapy:** Oral Metformin, Acarbose, Glipizide.
*   **Lipid-Lowering Therapy:** Oral Atorvastatin.
*   **Antihypertensive Therapy:** Oral Nifedipine Sustained-Release Tablets.
*   **Limb Numbness Management:** Oral Amitriptyline and Pregabalin for neuropathic pain relief, with Pregabalin dosage adjusted based on patient tolerance and efficacy.
*   **Neurotrophic Therapy:** Oral Mecobalamin.

**Rehabilitation Education:**
Comprehensive health education emphasizing the lifelong nature of diabetes and the critical importance of self-management is provided.
*   **Disease Knowledge Education:** Explain diabetes and peripheral neuropathy, emphasizing the foundational role of diet and exercise therapy.
*   **Self-Monitoring Guidance:** Instruct the patient on using a glucometer and supervise regular self-monitoring of fasting and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose to understand glycemic patterns.
*   **Hypoglycemia Prevention and Management:** Detail the triggers and clinical manifestations of hypoglycemia; teach prevention and self-rescue methods.
*   **Foot Care:** Emphasize personal hygiene importance; specifically instruct on daily foot care, including appropriate footwear/sock selection and maintaining clean, dry feet to prevent skin breakdown and infection.
