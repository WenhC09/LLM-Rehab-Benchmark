### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

#### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

**Short-term goals (within 4-6 weeks):**

*   **Symptom Control:** Reduce the intensity of neuropathic numbness and pain from a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score of 4/10 to â‰¤ 2/10 to improve sleep quality and comfort.
*   **Patient Education:** Ensure the patient can independently verbalize and demonstrate understanding of:
    *   The relationship between blood glucose/blood pressure control and the progression of neuropathy.
    *   Daily self-inspection foot care techniques to prevent injury.
    *   Safety precautions for exercise, including recognizing symptoms of hypoglycemia and cardiac distress.
*   **Functional Safety:** Initiate a balance and proprioception training program to mitigate fall risk secondary to sensory deficits.
*   **Exercise Initiation:** Establish a regular, supervised exercise routine of at least 3 sessions per week, demonstrating proper technique and tolerance.

**Long-term goals (within 3-6 months):**

*   **Functional Independence & Prevention:** Maintain a Modified Barthel Index score of 100/100, prevent any decline in activities of daily living, and prevent the occurrence of diabetic foot ulcers or fall-related injuries.
*   **Cardiometabolic Health Improvement:** Through a sustained lifestyle modification program, contribute to the medical management goals of:
    *   Achieving and maintaining HbA1c < 7.0%.
    *   Achieving and maintaining blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg.
    *   Achieving a 5-10% reduction in body weight.
*   **Enhanced Quality of Life:** Achieve sustained relief from neuropathic symptoms, improve cardiovascular fitness, and maintain independent, safe community ambulation.

#### 2. Treatment Methods

**A. Patient and Family Education (Cornerstone of Management)**

1.  **Diabetic Foot Care:**
    *   Provide intensive training on daily foot inspection using a long-handled mirror.
    *   Instruct on proper foot hygiene (daily washing with lukewarm water, thorough drying, especially between toes).
    *   Educate on appropriate footwear: closed-toe, well-fitting shoes with a wide toe box and cushioned soles. Emphasize the use of cotton or wool seamless socks.
    *   Strictly advise against walking barefoot to prevent unrecognized injury.
2.  **Exercise Safety Protocol:**
    *   Educate on the importance of a 5-10 minute warm-up and cool-down for every session.
    *   Train the patient to monitor for and respond to signs of hypoglycemia (dizziness, sweating, tremor) and cardiac ischemia (chest pain/pressure, excessive shortness of breath, palpitations).
    *   Advise on checking blood glucose levels before and after exercise, especially during the initial phase of the program.
3.  **Nutritional Guidance:**
    *   Arrange a consultation with a registered dietitian for a personalized medical nutrition therapy plan targeting glycemic control, weight loss (calorie deficit), and management of hypertension (sodium restriction) and hyperlipidemia (fat modification).

**B. Physical Therapy**

1.  **Pain and Symptom Management:**
    *   **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS):** Application to bilateral lower legs for 30-minute sessions, 1-2 times daily, for symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain.
2.  **Therapeutic Exercise (with cardiac precautions):**
    *   **Aerobic Conditioning:**
        *   **Modality:** Low-impact exercise such as stationary cycling or arm ergometry to minimize stress on feet. Water-based exercise is also a suitable option.
        *   **Intensity:** Moderate intensity, targeting a Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) of 11-13 ("fairly light" to "somewhat hard"). Heart rate should be monitored to stay within a safe range as determined in conjunction with the primary physician or cardiologist.
        *   **Frequency & Duration:** Begin with 20 minutes per session, 3 days per week, and gradually progress to 30-45 minutes, 5 days per week, as tolerated.
    *   **Resistance Training:**
        *   **Focus:** Target major muscle groups of the lower and upper body to improve strength and glucose uptake. Emphasize lower limb strengthening (quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals, tibialis anterior) to enhance joint stability.
        *   **Modality:** Use resistance bands or light weights.
        *   **Protocol:** 1-2 sets of 10-15 repetitions, 2-3 times per week on non-consecutive days. Instruct the patient to exhale on exertion to avoid the Valsalva maneuver and subsequent blood pressure spikes.
    *   **Balance and Proprioception Training:**
        *   **Goal:** To compensate for sensory loss and reduce fall risk.
        *   **Exercises:** Start with static balance drills (e.g., tandem stance, single-leg stance) with hand support. Progress to dynamic activities such as tandem walking, heel-to-toe walking, and gentle weight-shifting exercises. Tai Chi is highly recommended.
    *   **Flexibility:**
        *   Gentle static stretching of major muscle groups, particularly the calf (gastrocnemius/soleus) and hamstring muscles, holding each stretch for 30 seconds.

**C. Occupational Therapy**

1.  **Home Safety Evaluation:**
    *   Assess the home environment for fall hazards (e.g., loose rugs, poor lighting, cluttered pathways).
    *   Recommend modifications such as installing nightlights (especially on the path to the bathroom) and grab bars in the shower/tub.
2.  **Adaptive Strategies:**
    *   Reinforce education on adaptive equipment for foot inspection (long-handled mirror) and safe bathing (shower chair, non-slip mat).

**D. Interdisciplinary Collaboration**

*   Maintain close communication with the patient's primary physician, endocrinologist, and cardiologist to ensure the rehabilitation plan is aligned with medical management, particularly regarding adjustments to medications for glucose, blood pressure, and lipids in response to exercise and dietary changes.
*   Recommend the treating physician consider pharmacological management for neuropathic pain (e.g., gabapentinoids, SNRIs) to complement physical rehabilitation interventions.
