### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

#### 1. Rehabilitation Goals
**Short-term goals (4-8 weeks):**
- Reduce neuropathic pain intensity from NRS 4/10 to ≤2/10
- Improve vibration sense at bilateral ankles by ≥1 level on Rydel-Seiffer tuning fork scale
- Achieve systolic BP reduction to <140 mmHg through lifestyle interventions
- Decrease abdominal circumference by ≥3 cm via weight management
- Educate on comprehensive foot care protocol to prevent ulceration

**Long-term goals (3-6 months):**
- Maintain HbA1c ≤7.0% through glycemic control optimization
- Sustain neuropathic symptoms at NRS ≤1/10 without medication escalation
- Normalize lipid profile (TG <1.7 mmol/L, LDL-C <2.6 mmol/L)
- Preserve functional independence (Barthel 100/100) and prevent falls
- Establish sustainable exercise routine meeting ADA guidelines for cardiac safety

#### 2. Treatment Methods
**A. Neuropathy Management**
- *Electrotherapy*: Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) at 50-100Hz to plantar surfaces (20min/session, 5x/week)
- *Thermal Biofeedback*: Daily contrast baths (alternating 38°C/28°C water immersion) to modulate sensory thresholds
- *Monofilament Desensitization*: Graded sensory re-education using 5.07/10g monofilaments (3x/day)
- *Pharmacological Coordination*: Collaborate with endocrinology for neuropathic pain medication optimization (e.g., duloxetine/gabapentin)

**B. Metabolic Control Enhancement**
- *Supervised Exercise*:  
  - Aerobic: Cycle ergometry at 40-60% HR reserve (RPE 11-13), 30min/day  
  - Resistance: Progressive chair squats & calf raises (2 sets × 15 reps, 3x/week)  
  *Cardiac precautions: Continuous ECG monitoring during initial sessions*
- *Medical Nutrition Therapy*:  
  - Carbohydrate counting education with <45g/meal targets  
  - Mediterranean diet pattern implementation (25% protein/45% complex carbs/30% MUFA fats)  

**C. Cardiovascular Risk Mitigation**
- *Blood Pressure Control*:  
  - Isometric handgrip training (30% MVC, 4×2min bouts/day)  
  - Guided diaphragmatic breathing exercises (6 breaths/min, 10min BID)  
- *Lipid Optimization*:  
  - Aquatic therapy (water walking at chest depth, 3x/week) to enable exercise without joint stress  

**D. Preventative Strategies**
- *Foot Protection Program*:  
  - Daily tactile inspection training with magnifying mirrors  
  - Custom accommodative footwear fitting with pressure mapping  
- *Balance Preservation*:  
  - Single-leg stance progression on foam surface (3x/day)  
  - Tandem walking with eyes closed (5min/day)  

**E. Education & Self-Management**
- *Symptom Monitoring*: Structured pain/sensation diary with temperature discrimination tasks  
- *Medication Adherence*: Pillbox organization training and hypoglycemia recognition drills  
- *Lifestyle Integration*: SMART goal setting for daily step targets (initial 4000 steps/day)  

**Safety Parameters:**  
- Exercise terminated for BP >180/100 mmHg or angina symptoms  
- Foot inspection before/after all weight-bearing activities  
- Glycemic checks pre/post exercise if BG <5.5 mmol/L or >13.9 mmol/L
