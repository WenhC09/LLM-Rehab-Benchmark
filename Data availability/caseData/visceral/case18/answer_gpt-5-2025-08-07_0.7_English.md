## Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-term goals (within 4–6 weeks):
- Relieve numbness and discomfort in both lower legs and feet, aiming to reduce NRS pain score from 4 to ≤2.
- Improve lower limb sensory function and microcirculation to slow progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
- Enhance patient’s knowledge and skills in self-management of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
- Initiate safe, individualized aerobic and resistance exercise program without exacerbating cardiovascular risk.
- Achieve better glycemic control towards target fasting blood glucose <7.0 mmol/L and HbA1c <7.0% in collaboration with endocrinology.

#### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months and beyond):
- Maintain stable or improved peripheral nerve function, preventing ulceration or further sensory loss.
- Optimize cardiovascular health, blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg), and lipid profile (LDL <2.6 mmol/L) through lifestyle and medical management.
- Maintain or reduce BMI towards <27 with waist circumference reduction to <90 cm.
- Preserve independence in all activities of daily living (ADL) and prevent diabetes-related complications.
- Establish sustainable self-monitoring and lifestyle habits for long-term disease control.

### 2. Treatment Methods

#### (1) Therapeutic Exercise
- **Aerobic training**: 
  - Mode: Brisk walking, stationary cycling, or swimming (if no foot lesions).
  - Intensity: Moderate (50–70% of maximal heart rate), using Borg RPE scale 11–13.
  - Frequency: 3–5 times/week, 30–40 minutes/session.
  - Precautions: Foot inspection before and after exercise; avoid barefoot walking.
- **Resistance training**:
  - 2–3 times/week, targeting major muscle groups of upper and lower limbs.
  - Intensity: Low to moderate, 1–2 sets of 10–15 repetitions.
  - Avoid Valsalva maneuver to reduce cardiovascular strain.
- **Flexibility and balance training**:
  - Daily stretching of calf, hamstring, and quadriceps muscles.
  - Balance exercises (e.g., tandem stance, single-leg stance with support) to reduce fall risk due to sensory loss.

#### (2) Physical Therapy Modalities
- **Peripheral neuropathy management**:
  - Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to lower limbs, 20–30 min/day, 5 days/week for neuropathic pain relief.
  - Infrared therapy or warm water foot baths (temperature <40°C, check with hand first) to promote local circulation; avoid burns due to sensory deficit.
- **Foot care education**:
  - Daily inspection for skin integrity, pressure areas, or infection.
  - Proper footwear with soft insoles, no barefoot walking.

#### (3) Occupational Therapy and ADL Training
- Reinforce safe mobility strategies and protective sensation awareness.
- Train in energy conservation techniques to cope with comorbid cardiac conditions.
- Educate on safe cooking and bathing practices to prevent burns or injuries.

#### (4) Patient Education and Self-Management
- **Diabetes management**:
  - Blood glucose self-monitoring at least 2–3 times/week; record and review with healthcare provider.
  - Adherence to antidiabetic medications; coordinate with physician for dose adjustment.
- **Dietary counseling** (in collaboration with dietitian):
  - Low glycemic index carbohydrates, increased dietary fiber, reduced saturated fat and cholesterol intake.
  - Caloric control for gradual weight loss (0.5–1 kg/month).
- **Cardiovascular risk control**:
  - Limit sodium intake (<5 g/day salt).
  - Continue prescribed antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications.
- **Lifestyle modification**:
  - Maintain regular sleep schedule, avoid prolonged sitting (>1 h without movement).

#### (5) Medical Monitoring and Interdisciplinary Collaboration
- Regular follow-up with endocrinology, cardiology, and ophthalmology.
- Quarterly HbA1c monitoring; periodic lipid and renal function tests.
- Annual comprehensive foot examination and fundoscopy.
- Adjust rehabilitation intensity based on cardiovascular tolerance and glycemic control.
