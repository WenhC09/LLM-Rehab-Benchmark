## Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-term goals (2–4 weeks)
1. Improve cardiopulmonary tolerance to enable sitting up in bed for ≥30 minutes without significant dyspnea or dizziness.
2. Increase proximal lower limb muscle strength from 2+/5 to at least 3/5.
3. Improve sitting balance from grade 3 to grade 4 (able to maintain without support >2 minutes and perform small dynamic activities).
4. Tolerate transfer training from bed to chair with minimal assistance.
5. Reduce bilateral lower limb edema through positioning and circulation-promoting activities.
6. Optimize nutritional intake and address anemia, hypoproteinemia, and electrolyte imbalances in coordination with medical and nutritional teams.

#### Long-term goals (8–12 weeks)
1. Achieve independent indoor ambulation with or without assistive devices for ≥50 meters without severe dyspnea (Borg scale ≤3).
2. Improve Berg Balance Scale score from 23/56 to ≥40/56, reducing fall risk.
3. Enhance ADL score from 45/100 to ≥70/100, achieving independence in basic self-care (dressing, toileting, feeding).
4. Increase overall muscle strength to ≥4/5 in major muscle groups.
5. Improve LVEF stability and functional capacity to NYHA Class II or better in collaboration with cardiology.
6. Enhance social participation, including returning to light photography-related tasks.

### 2. Treatment Methods

#### A. Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation
- **Low-intensity, interval-based training** under continuous monitoring (SpO₂, HR, BP):
  - Begin with bedside sitting tolerance training → progress to dangling and standing tolerance.
  - Initiate active-assisted range of motion (AAROM) for upper/lower limbs in supine/seated positions to promote circulation.
  - Breathing exercises: diaphragmatic breathing, pursed-lip breathing, twice daily, 10–15 minutes/session.
- **Energy conservation strategies**: Educate patient on pacing, rest breaks, and prioritizing activities.

#### B. Muscle Strengthening & Mobility Training
- **Phase 1 (bed-bound/early mobility)**:
  - Active/active-assisted exercises for all extremities and trunk, 10–15 reps × 2–3 sets/day.
  - Isometric contractions for quadriceps, gluteals, abdominal muscles.
- **Phase 2 (improving tolerance)**:
  - Gradual progression to resistance exercises using elastic bands or light weights (0.5–1 kg) for distal muscles, as tolerated.
  - Supported standing training using parallel bars; start with 1–2 minutes, increase gradually.
- **Phase 3 (gait initiation)**:
  - Walker-assisted short step training once balance and cardiopulmonary tolerance allow.

#### C. Balance and Coordination Training
- Seated balance: reaching tasks, trunk rotation in supported sitting.
- Standing balance: weight shifts, side steps in parallel bars with therapist guarding.
- Incorporate visual and proprioceptive cues to improve postural control.

#### D. ADL Training
- Bed mobility: rolling, bridging, moving to edge of bed.
- Transfer training: bed-to-chair with sliding board or pivot transfers.
- Practice dressing, grooming, and feeding with adaptive equipment if needed.

#### E. Edema Management
- Lower limb elevation when resting, ankle pumps, gentle massage (if no contraindication).
- Graduated compression stockings after vascular evaluation.

#### F. Nutritional Support (in collaboration with nutrition team)
- High-protein, high-calorie diet tailored to renal and cardiac status.
- Supplement iron, folic acid, electrolytes per lab results and medical orders.
- Small, frequent meals to reduce postprandial fatigue.

#### G. Patient & Family Education
- Heart failure self-management: fluid restriction if prescribed, daily weight monitoring, symptom recognition.
- Safe exercise principles and signs to stop activity (severe dyspnea, chest pain, dizziness).
- Psychological support to address mood, motivation, and coping.

#### H. Multidisciplinary Coordination
- **Cardiology**: optimize heart failure regimen.
- **Hematology**: monitor post-transplant status, blood counts.
- **Nephrology**: manage chronic kidney insufficiency.
- **Nutrition**: individualized dietary plan.
- **Psychology**: support for anxiety/depression related to prolonged illness.

#### I. Safety Precautions
- Avoid overexertion; maintain Borg perceived exertion ≤3 during exercise.
- Monitor orthostatic symptoms; use gradual positional changes.
- Maintain infection precautions due to immunocompromised status.
- Ensure fall prevention measures during all mobility training.
