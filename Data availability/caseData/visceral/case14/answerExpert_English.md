### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

**Short-Term Goals (Inpatient Rehabilitation Phase):**
*   Improve overall muscle strength, particularly in the trunk and proximal limbs, to establish a foundation for out-of-bed activities.
*   Enhance sitting and standing balance ability to prevent falls.
*   Increase cardiopulmonary endurance, gradually adapting to low-intensity aerobic exercise.
*   Learn and master energy conservation techniques to reduce energy expenditure during activities of daily living (ADL), preliminarily improving self-care ability.
*   Establish an effective safety monitoring mechanism to avoid cardiovascular adverse events such as orthostatic hypotension during rehabilitation.

**Long-Term Goals (Outpatient and Home-Based Rehabilitation Phase):**
*   Continuously enhance muscle strength and endurance, restoring independent walking ability and activities of daily living (ADL).
*   Significantly improve cardiac function, increasing left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and exercise tolerance (e.g., 6-minute walk distance).
*   Restore balance function, reduce fall risk, achieving normal or near-normal levels on the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB).
*   Achieve social role reintegration, ultimately enabling full return to previous occupations as photographer and video editor.
*   Establish healthy lifestyle habits and self-management capabilities, including regular exercise, nutritional management, and psychological adjustment, to maintain long-term health.

### 2. Treatment Methods

**Exercise Therapy:**
*   **Exercise Modalities and Content:**
    *   **Strength Training:** Begin with bed exercises, including trunk isometric contraction training and limb isotonic resistance training. Avoid breath-holding (Valsalva maneuver) during training. In the outpatient phase, gradually transition to bodyweight resistance training and elastic band resistance training under protective supervision.
    *   **Aerobic Exercise:** Initially performed using supine cycling, starting at 10 minutes per session and gradually increasing to 20 minutes based on tolerance. During home-based rehabilitation, recommend gentle traditional exercises such as Tai Chi or Baduanjin.
    *   **Balance Training:** Progress from seated balance training to protected standing balance training, followed by walking training within parallel bars.
    *   **Respiratory Muscle Training:** Utilize inspiratory muscle trainers for inspiratory resistance training, combined with pursed-lip breathing and diaphragmatic breathing training to address respiratory muscle dysfunction secondary to prolonged bed rest and trunk weakness.
    *   **Functional Training:** Perform training for activities of daily living and provide energy conservation technique instruction to reduce energy expenditure during daily tasks. Gradually improve self-care abilities in bathing, dressing, toileting, and bed-chair transfers.
*   **Exercise Intensity:**
    *   Monitored using the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale, maintaining exercise fatigue level between 10-13 (light to moderate fatigue).
    *   Strict cardiovascular monitoring: Exercise heart rate not to exceed 130 bpm; training must be stopped immediately if systolic blood pressure decreases or increases by more than 20 mmHg.
    *   During later home-based rehabilitation, aerobic exercise intensity may be gradually increased, targeting a heart rate corresponding to 50%-80% of peak oxygen uptake (VOâ‚‚peak).
*   **Exercise Duration and Frequency:**
    *   Implement an individualized and flexible regimen. Due to poor muscular endurance, alternate training components (strength, endurance, functional training) with relatively shorter repetition counts and durations per set.
    *   Inpatient frequency: Daily sessions, 3-5 times per week. Outpatient frequency adjusted based on patient response, ensuring 2-5 sessions per week.
*   **Training Modifications and Safety Measures:**
    *   For orthostatic hypotension occurring during training, adjust sequence: perform seated/standing adaptation training before supine strength training.
    *   Apply elastic band wrapping to bilateral lower limbs prior to standing training to enhance venous return.
    *   Implement intermittent, short-duration standing training patterns and increase adaptation time during positional changes.
    *   Closely monitor and manage other potential adverse reactions during training, such as syncope induced by inspiratory resistance training.

**Physical Agent Modalities:**
*   Utilize Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) as an adjunct to active training to enhance muscle strength and mass.
*   Treatment sites include major limb muscle groups (bilateral deltoids, biceps brachii, quadriceps, triceps surae) and core muscle groups (rectus abdominis, lumbar paraspinals).
*   Treatment frequency: Daily, 5 times per week, throughout inpatient and outpatient phases.

**Nutritional Support:**
*   Recommend a "natural food + oral nutritional supplementation (ONS)" approach to address malnutrition risk.
*   For natural foods: Increase intake of high-quality protein-rich foods such as meat and dairy products based on existing diet.
*   For ONS: Select specific nutritional formulas such as Nutrison or Ensure, consumed in divided doses to boost energy and protein intake.

**Rehabilitation Education and Psychological Support:**
*   **Rehabilitation Education:** Educate the patient on disease characteristics, exercise necessity, and safety warning signs (termination criteria) during activity. Instruct on self-monitoring of body weight, fluid intake/output control, and strict adherence to a low-sodium diet.
*   **Psychological Support:** Assess psychological status through depression and anxiety self-assessment. Encourage active participation in family activities and gradual resumption of social interactions. Simultaneously, encourage family involvement throughout the rehabilitation process to provide support and assistance.
