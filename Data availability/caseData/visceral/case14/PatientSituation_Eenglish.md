### Case Summary

The patient is a 36-year-old married male, working as a photographer and video editor. Admitted on July 24, 2021.

**Chief Complaint**: Sudden-onset limb weakness, intermittent chest tightness, and shortness of breath for over 8 months.

**History of Present Illness**:  
Eight months prior (November 24, 2020), the patient underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at an external hospital. During transplantation, he developed multiple severe complications including *Candida tropicalis* septicemia and multi-organ damage (severe acute pancreatitis, septicemia, allergic dermatitis, autoimmune arthritis, acute kidney injury, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, myocardial injury), accompanied by metabolic acidosis, electrolyte imbalances, hypoproteinemia, and coagulation disorders. Throughout treatment, he did not require mechanical ventilation or sedative analgesia but experienced sudden limb weakness, atrial fibrillation, chest tightness, and dyspnea. Laboratory tests revealed significantly elevated C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and IL-6. Following symptomatic treatment, his internal medical conditions improved, but limb weakness and dyspnea persist. Currently, he experiences dyspnea after walking only a few steps indoors. He can lie flat but presents with bilateral lower limb edema, chest pain, palpitations, and occasional dizziness and near-syncope, which resolve with rest. No orthopnea, fever, cough, sputum, or hemoptysis. Urine output is normal. Since onset, he reports poor mental state and sleep quality, fair appetite, two episodes of urinary incontinence, and normal bowel movements. Weight loss of 40 kg over the past year, with no significant change in the last two weeks. Currently bed-bound and wheelchair-dependent.

**Past Medical History**:  
Diagnosed with AML in June 2020, received three cycles of IA regimen (Idarubicin + Cytarabine) chemotherapy. The last cycle was terminated early due to persistently elevated transaminases. Bone marrow biopsy on September 14, 2020, indicated complete remission. Underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on November 24, 2020; current hematological parameters are stable. Denies history of hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, neuropsychiatric disorders, hepatitis, tuberculosis, or malaria. Vaccination history unknown. No prior surgeries, trauma, or food allergies.

**Personal History**: Unremarkable.

**Marital and Reproductive History**: Married at appropriate age. Has one daughter; spouse and child are healthy.

**Family History**:  
Both parents alive. Father has hypertension. Maternal grandmother died of leukemia.

**Diagnoses**:
1.  Chronic Heart Failure (NYHA Class III)
2.  Acute Myeloid Leukemia
3.  Post Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
4.  Reduced Muscle Strength in Limbs
5.  Right Ear Hearing Impairment
6.  Iron-Deficiency Anemia
7.  Hypoproteinemia
8.  Hyponatremia
9.  Hyperlipidemia
10. Chronic Renal Insufficiency
11. Folic Acid Deficiency
12. Electrolyte Imbalances

**Functional Diagnoses**:
1.  ICU-Acquired Weakness?  
2.  Balance Impairment  
3.  Impaired Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
4.  Restricted Social Participation
