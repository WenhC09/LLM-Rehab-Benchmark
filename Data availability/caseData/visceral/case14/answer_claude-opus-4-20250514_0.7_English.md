### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

1. **Rehabilitation Goals:**
   - **Short-term goals:**
     - Improve muscle strength in upper and lower limbs by at least one grade within 4 weeks.
     - Enhance sitting and standing balance to achieve Grade 4 in sitting balance and Grade 3 in standing balance within 6 weeks.
     - Increase the Barthel Index score to 60/100 within 8 weeks, indicating reduced dependence in activities of daily living (ADL).
     - Manage dyspnea to allow the patient to walk at least 10 meters with minimal assistance within 6 weeks.

   - **Long-term goals:**
     - Achieve independent ambulation with a walker or cane within 3 months.
     - Improve overall physical performance as measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) to at least 6/12 within 3 months.
     - Enhance quality of life and psychological well-being, aiming for a significant reduction in reported fatigue and improvement in sleep quality within 3 months.

2. **Treatment Methods:**
   - **Physical Therapy:**
     - Initiate a structured physical therapy program focusing on:
       - Progressive resistance training for upper and lower limbs, starting with isometric exercises and gradually increasing resistance.
       - Balance training exercises, including static and dynamic balance tasks, to improve stability and prevent falls.
       - Gait training with assistive devices (walker or cane) to promote safe ambulation.

   - **Occupational Therapy:**
     - Implement ADL training to enhance independence in self-care tasks, focusing on bathing, dressing, and toileting.
     - Use adaptive equipment as needed to facilitate participation in daily activities.

   - **Nutritional Support:**
     - Consult a dietitian to develop a high-protein, calorie-dense diet to address hypoalbuminemia and iron-deficiency anemia.
     - Monitor nutritional intake and adjust dietary plans based on ongoing assessments.

   - **Cardiac Rehabilitation:**
     - Introduce a monitored exercise program tailored to the patient's cardiac condition, focusing on low-intensity aerobic exercises to improve cardiovascular endurance.
     - Educate the patient on recognizing signs of cardiac distress and the importance of pacing during activities.

   - **Psychosocial Support:**
     - Provide psychological counseling to address mental health concerns, including anxiety and depression related to the patient's condition.
     - Encourage participation in support groups for individuals recovering from cancer and its treatments.

   - **Monitoring and Follow-up:**
     - Regularly assess progress through follow-up evaluations every 2 weeks, adjusting the rehabilitation plan as necessary based on the patient's response to treatment.
     - Coordinate with the medical team to monitor vital signs, laboratory results, and overall health status to ensure comprehensive care.
