# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4-8 weeks):
- **Improve Muscle Strength**: Increase lower limb proximal muscle strength to 3/5 and upper limb proximal strength to 4/5 on Manual Muscle Testing (MMT).
- **Enhance Functional Mobility**: Achieve independent bed-chair transfers and assisted ambulation for 5-10 meters with a walker.
- **Improve Sitting and Standing Balance**: Increase Berg Balance Scale (BBS) score to 30/56 and standing balance duration to 5 minutes.
- **Optimize Cardiopulmonary Endurance**: Reduce exertional dyspnea to allow walking 10-20 meters without chest tightness or palpitations.
- **Address Nutritional Deficiencies**: Correct iron-deficiency anemia, hypoproteinemia, and folic acid deficiency to support physical recovery.
- **Improve ADL Independence**: Increase ADL score to 60/100, enabling partial independence in bathing and toileting.
- **Reduce Frailty**: Improve at least two criteria on the Fried Frailty Phenotype (e.g., grip strength and physical activity).

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- **Restore Functional Strength**: Achieve lower limb proximal muscle strength of 4/5 and trunk strength of 3+/5 to support independent ambulation.
- **Enhance Ambulation**: Achieve independent ambulation for 50 meters with a cane and stair climbing with assistance.
- **Improve Cardiopulmonary Function**: Increase left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to >50% (if medically feasible) and eliminate exertional dyspnea during daily activities.
- **Maximize ADL Independence**: Achieve ADL score of 80/100, enabling independence in most daily activities (bathing, dressing, toileting).
- **Promote Social Participation**: Enable return to light work-related activities (e.g., photography editing) and community engagement with minimal assistance.
- **Prevent Complications**: Maintain stable renal function, normalize electrolyte imbalances, and prevent recurrent infections.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Physical Therapy
- **Strength Training**:
  - **Upper Limbs**: Progressive resistance exercises (e.g., theraband exercises for shoulder flexion/extension, elbow flexion/extension) at 50-60% of 1-repetition maximum (1RM), 2-3 sets of 10-12 repetitions, 3 times/week. Monitor for fatigue and adjust intensity.
  - **Lower Limbs**: Isometric quadriceps/hamstring exercises progressing to seated leg press with light resistance (1-2 kg), 2-3 sets of 10 repetitions, 3 times/week. Use ankle weights for distal muscle strengthening.
  - **Trunk**: Gentle core stabilization exercises (e.g., pelvic tilts, seated abdominal contractions), 2 sets of 10 repetitions, 3 times/week.
- **Balance Training**:
  - Sitting balance exercises (e.g., weight shifting on a therapy ball), 10 minutes/day.
  - Standing balance training with parallel bars or walker support (e.g., tandem stance, single-leg stance with support), progressing to 15-20 minutes/day as tolerated.
  - Incorporate functional tasks (e.g., reaching for objects while standing) to improve BBS score.
- **Functional Mobility**:
  - Bed mobility training (e.g., rolling, scooting) and bed-chair transfer practice with minimal assistance, 10-15 minutes/day.
  - Assisted ambulation with a walker, starting at 5 meters and progressing to 20 meters, 2-3 sessions/day. Monitor heart rate (target <120 bpm) and dyspnea.
- **Cardiopulmonary Endurance**:
  - Interval training: Seated arm ergometry or leg cycling at low intensity (Borg RPE 11-13), 5-10 minutes/session, 2-3 times/day, with rest intervals as needed.
  - Breathing exercises (e.g., diaphragmatic breathing, pursed-lip breathing) to reduce dyspnea, 5-10 minutes, 3 times/day.

### Occupational Therapy
- **ADL Training**:
  - Practice bathing and dressing with adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled sponge, dressing stick), 20 minutes/day.
  - Toileting training with raised toilet seat and grab bars to improve independence, 15 minutes/day.
  - Energy conservation techniques (e.g., pacing, prioritizing tasks) to reduce fatigue during ADLs.
- **Upper Limb Function**:
  - Fine motor exercises (e.g., pegboard tasks, buttoning practice) to improve grip strength and dexterity, 15 minutes/day.
  - Functional tasks related to photography editing (e.g., simulated mouse/keyboard use) to prepare for vocational reintegration, 10-15 minutes/day.

### Nutritional and Medical Support
- **Nutritional Therapy**:
  - Consult dietitian for high-protein, high-calorie diet (1.2-1.5 g/kg protein, 30-35 kcal/kg daily) to address hypoproteinemia and weight loss.
  - Supplement iron (e.g., ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily) and folic acid (1 mg daily) under medical supervision to correct deficiencies.
  - Monitor fluid intake to manage edema and hyponatremia, aiming for 1.5-2 L/day unless contraindicated by renal or cardiac status.
- **Medical Management**:
  - Coordinate with cardiologist to optimize heart failure treatment (e.g., beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, diuretics) to improve LVEF and reduce dyspnea.
  - Monitor renal function and electrolytes weekly, adjusting medications as needed for chronic renal insufficiency and hyponatremia.
  - Prophylactic antibiotics if infection risk persists, given history of *Candida tropicalis* septicemia.

### Psychological Support
- **Counseling**:
  - Weekly sessions with a clinical psychologist to address poor mental state and sleep quality, using cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques for anxiety and depression.
  - Sleep hygiene education (e.g., consistent sleep schedule, limiting screen time) to improve rest.
- **Motivational Support**:
  - Incorporate family involvement (e.g., spouse, daughter) in therapy sessions to enhance motivation and social support, 1-2 times/week.

### Additional Interventions
- **Hearing Support**:
  - Refer to audiology for right ear hearing impairment assessment and potential hearing aid fitting to improve communication during therapy.
- **Assistive Devices**:
  - Provide lightweight walker for ambulation, raised toilet seat, and grab bars for safety.
  - Recommend wheelchair with pressure-relieving cushion for prolonged sitting to prevent pressure ulcers.
- **Education**:
  - Educate patient and family on energy conservation, fall prevention, and signs of cardiac or respiratory distress requiring immediate medical attention.

### Monitoring and Progression
- **Weekly Assessments**:
  - Re-evaluate MMT, BBS, and ADL scores weekly to track progress and adjust exercise intensity.
  - Monitor vital signs (BP, HR, RR) before, during, and after therapy to ensure safety.
  - Assess for signs of overexertion (e.g., excessive fatigue, worsening dyspnea, or palpitations).
- **Progression Criteria**:
  - Increase exercise intensity/duration when patient sustains 10-15 minutes of activity without dyspnea or heart rate >120 bpm.
  - Transition to independent ambulation when BBS score reaches 35/56 and lower limb strength is 3+/5.
- **Multidisciplinary Coordination**:
  - Weekly team meetings with physical therapist, occupational therapist, dietitian, psychologist, and medical team to ensure holistic care and adjust plan based on clinical status.

### Precautions
- Avoid high-intensity exercises due to chronic heart failure (NYHA Class III) and low LVEF (44%).
- Monitor for signs of cardiac decompensation (e.g., worsening dyspnea, edema, or near-syncope).
- Ensure proper hydration and electrolyte balance to prevent exacerbation of renal insufficiency or hyponatremia.
- Limit standing exercises to <5 minutes initially to prevent orthostatic hypotension (BP 90/60 mmHg).
