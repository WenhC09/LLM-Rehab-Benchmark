### Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

#### 1. Rehabilitation Goals
**Short-term goals (2-4 weeks):**
- Improve proximal lower limb strength to ≥Grade 3 on MMT
- Achieve independent sitting balance (Grade 4) and standing balance (Grade 3)
- Increase Barthel Index to 55/100 (minimal assistance for basic ADLs)
- Reduce resting heart rate to <90 bpm through graded activity
- Complete 4-meter gait with wheeled walker and minimal assistance
- Perform 3 consecutive sit-to-stand transitions with moderate assistance
- Maintain oxygen saturation >92% during all activities

**Long-term goals (3-6 months):**
- Restore independent ambulation ≥50m with single-point cane
- Achieve MRC-SS >50/60 and SPPB ≥6/12
- Attain modified Barthel Index ≥75/100 (functional independence)
- Improve LVEF to >50% through cardiopulmonary rehabilitation
- Return to sedentary work activities (photography editing) ≥2hrs/day
- Reduce frailty phenotype to ≤3/5 criteria

#### 2. Treatment Methods
**Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation**  
- *Aerobic training:* Bedside cycle ergometer (5-10min, 1-2x/day) at 40-50% HR reserve (target HR <110 bpm)  
- *Inspiratory muscle training:* Threshold loading at 30% maximal inspiratory pressure (10 reps, 3 sets/day)  
- *Energy conservation techniques:* Paced activity scheduling with 1:2 work-rest ratio  
- *ECG-monitored progression:* Increase activity duration by 1-2min/day when SpO₂ remains >92%  

**Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation**  
- *Strength training:*  
  - Lower limbs: Seated knee extensions (1-2 sets × 8 reps) with ankle weights (start 0.5kg)  
  - Upper limbs: Theraband rows (yellow band, 2 sets × 10 reps)  
  - Core: Supine pelvic tilts (10 reps/hour) and supported sitting balance drills  
- *Functional electrical stimulation:* Quadriceps stimulation during transfer training (20min, 2x/day)  
- *Weight-bearing progression:* Tilt table standing (start 30° × 5min, increase 5°/day)  

**Functional Mobility Training**  
- *Transfer training:* Bed-chair transfers with sliding board (minimal assistance)  
- *Gait training:* Parallel bars → wheeled walker (begin with 2-person assist, target 10m)  
- *Stair simulation:* 4-inch step training with handrails (1 step/min, 3x/day)  

**Balance and Coordination**  
- *Static balance:* Feet-together stance with chair support (3 × 30s)  
- *Dynamic balance:* Seated ball toss (3kg medicine ball), progressing to standing weight shifts  
- *Vestibular rehab:* Gaze stabilization during head turns (seated position)  

**ADL Re-education**  
- *Adaptive dressing:* Front-opening garments with dressing stick (15min supervised practice)  
- *Toileting program:* Raised toilet seat with grab bars, scheduled voiding every 2hrs  
- *Bathing safety:* Bed bath → seated shower chair transfer training  

**Nutritional & Medical Management**  
- *Protein supplementation:* 1.5g/kg/day high-biological-value protein (whey isolate)  
- *Electrolyte protocol:* Sodium ≥135mmol/L via oral rehydration solution + IV supplementation PRN  
- *Renal protection:* Strict fluid balance monitoring (input/output chart), avoid nephrotoxic agents  
- *Frailty intervention:* Vitamin D 2000IU/day + folate 5mg/day supplementation  

**Precautions & Monitoring**  
- Cardiac monitoring: Terminate activity if HR >135 bpm, BP drop >20mmHg, or new arrhythmia  
- Fall prevention: Bed alarm, non-skid footwear, and supervised mobility only  
- Neutropenic precautions: HEPA-filtered environment, daily CBC review  
- Renal protection: Daily creatinine clearance calculation, avoid NSAIDs  
- Progression criteria: Advance only when MMT improves ≥0.5 grade and no orthostatic symptoms  

**Frequency & Duration**  
- Phase I (Weeks 1-2): 30min sessions, 2x/day, 6 days/week (bedside)  
- Phase II (Weeks 3-4): 45min sessions, 2x/day + 1hr OT (rehabilitation gym)  
- Reassessment: Weekly MMT, biweekly BBS and 4-meter gait test
