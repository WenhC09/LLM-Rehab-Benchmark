### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-term goals (to be achieved within 4-6 weeks):
*   **Bed Mobility & Transfers:** Independently perform rolling in bed and sit up at the edge of the bed. Perform bed-to-chair transfers with minimal (one-person) assistance using a sliding board.
*   **Sitting & Standing Tolerance:** Maintain independent static sitting balance for >15 minutes. Tolerate standing with a walker in parallel bars for at least 5 minutes with stable vital signs (HR increase <20 bpm from rest, no significant drop in BP, SpO2 >92%).
*   **Muscle Strength:** Improve proximal muscle strength in upper and lower limbs to Grade 3+ (MMT) and trunk muscle strength to Grade 3. Increase grip strength by 10% from baseline.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):** Achieve independence in seated upper body dressing and grooming. Participate in lower body dressing with moderate assistance.
*   **Patient Education:** Patient and family will be able to verbalize signs of exercise intolerance (e.g., excessive dyspnea, chest pain, dizziness) and demonstrate 2-3 energy conservation techniques.

#### Long-term goals (to be achieved within 3-6 months):
*   **Ambulation:** Achieve independent indoor ambulation for over 20 meters using a front-wheeled walker, with good safety awareness.
*   **Functional Independence:** Improve Barthel Index score to >75 (mild dependence), including independence in toileting and bathing using appropriate assistive devices.
*   **Balance & Safety:** Improve Berg Balance Scale score to >40 to reduce fall risk and the need for gait assistance.
*   **Strength & Endurance:** Be able to perform 5 repetitions of the sit-to-stand test from a standard height chair with minimal assistance. Tolerate 15-20 minutes of continuous low-intensity aerobic activity (e.g., stationary cycling).
*   **Community Reintegration & Quality of Life:** Be able to participate in short community outings (with wheelchair or walker). Report improvement in self-perceived energy levels and mood.

### 2. Treatment Methods

**General Principles:** All therapy will be initiated at a very low intensity due to severe cardiac compromise (LVEF 44%), frailty, and orthostatic intolerance. Sessions will be short (20-30 minutes), potentially 1-2 times per day, with a focus on frequent rest periods. Continuous monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and subjective scales (Borg RPE, Dyspnea Scale) is mandatory.

**A. Physical Therapy (PT)**

*   **Cardiopulmonary Conditioning:**
    *   **Breathing Control:** Daily training in diaphragmatic and pursed-lip breathing to manage dyspnea and improve respiratory efficiency.
    *   **Aerobic Training:**
        *   **Initial:** Seated upper body ergometry (arm bike) with no resistance for 3-5 minute intervals. Target Borg RPE of 11-12 ("Fairly Light").
        *   **Progression:** Once sitting/standing tolerance improves, introduce recumbent cycling with no resistance, gradually increasing duration by 1-2 minutes per week as tolerated.
    *   **Safety Monitoring:** Strict adherence to stop criteria: SpO2 <90%, onset of chest pain, dizziness, Borg dyspnea >4/10, significant BP changes, or excessive tachycardia.

*   **Muscle Strengthening:**
    *   **Initial Phase (Gravity-Minimized):**
        *   **Lower Limbs:** Active-assisted and active range of motion in supine (e.g., heel slides, hip abduction).
        *   **Upper Limbs:** Seated active range of motion for shoulders and elbows, using supports like a table or powder board.
        *   **Trunk:** Focus on core activation via gentle bridging, pelvic tilts, and controlled rolling in bed.
    *   **Progression (Against Gravity & Light Resistance):**
        *   Once MMT Grade 3 is achieved, progress to against-gravity exercises (e.g., seated knee extension, seated shoulder flexion).
        *   Introduce light resistance (e.g., 0.5-1 kg weights, yellow/red resistance bands) only when the patient can complete 10-12 repetitions without compromising form or cardiopulmonary stability.

*   **Functional Mobility & Balance Training:**
    *   **Sitting Balance:** Progress from static sitting with support to unsupported static sitting, then to dynamic sitting activities (e.g., reaching in multiple planes).
    *   **Transfer Training:** Use a gait belt for all transfers. Train in component parts of the bed-to-chair transfer, utilizing a sliding board and proper body mechanics. Progress to stand-pivot transfers as leg strength improves.
    *   **Standing & Pre-Gait:** Begin with static standing in parallel bars. Progress to weight shifting, marching in place, and tandem stance with support.
    *   **Gait Training:** Once standing tolerance exceeds 5 minutes, initiate gait training with a front-wheeled walker and contact guard assistance for very short distances (5-10 feet) within the parallel bars or therapy room.

**B. Occupational Therapy (OT)**

*   **ADL Retraining & Energy Conservation:**
    *   **Training:** Provide adaptive equipment and instruction for independence in grooming, upper body dressing, and bathing (initially with a bedside basin, progressing to a shower chair).
    *   **Education:** Implement a structured energy conservation program (the 4 P's: Pacing, Planning, Prioritizing, Positioning) to be applied to all daily activities.
*   **Upper Extremity & Hand Function:**
    *   Utilize therapeutic putty, hand grippers, and fine motor tasks (e.g., pegboards, manipulating nuts and bolts) to improve grip strength and dexterity.
    *   Simulate functional tasks relevant to personal interests and occupation (e.g., holding a camera body, using a keyboard/mouse).
*   **Psychosocial & Cognitive Support:**
    *   Introduce relaxation techniques, mindfulness, and sleep hygiene education to address poor mental status and sleep.
    *   Engage the patient in meaningful, low-exertion leisure activities to improve mood and combat feelings of helplessness.
    *   Initiate discussions on ergonomic setups for future return to video editing work.

**C. Interdisciplinary Collaboration**

*   **Nutritional Support:** Liaise closely with the dietitian to ensure the patient's nutritional plan supports muscle synthesis and addresses deficiencies (iron, folate). Monitor weight and nutritional markers.
*   **Medical Liaison:** Maintain daily communication with the primary medical and cardiology teams regarding the patient's tolerance to therapy, fluid status, electrolyte levels, and renal function. Adjust therapy intensity based on daily medical stability.
*   **Psychological Support:** Recommend a formal consultation with a psychologist or psychiatrist to address poor mental status, potential adjustment disorder, or depression, which can be significant barriers to rehabilitation.
