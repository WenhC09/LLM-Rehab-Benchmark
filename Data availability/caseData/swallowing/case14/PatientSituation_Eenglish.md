# Case Information

## I. Medical Record Summary

**Patient Profile:** Male, 61 years old, retired worker, transferred to our department on February 12, 2023.

**Chief Complaint:** Sudden onset of impaired consciousness with right-sided limb movement disorder for over 1 month.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Over one month ago, the patient developed impaired consciousness and movement difficulties without obvious precipitating factors. Family members called emergency services (120), and he was admitted to our emergency department. Head CT revealed "cerebellar vermis and right cerebellar hemisphere hemorrhage." He immediately underwent microscopic cerebellar hematoma evacuation + right lateral ventricle burr hole external drainage under general anesthesia in the Neuro-Intensive Care Unit (NICU). During NICU treatment, he had a nasogastric-jejunal tube and tracheostomy tube in place. Subsequent symptomatic management included dehydration for intracranial pressure reduction, anti-infection therapy, nebulization for expectoration, antihypertensive treatment, and nutritional support. During the course, he developed high fever, ineffective cough with sputum production, and dyspnea, diagnosed as stroke-associated pneumonia. Tracheostomy was performed immediately. Anti-infection therapy, nebulization for expectoration, and vibration expectoration were continued, alongside early bedside rehabilitation. After active treatment, his consciousness gradually improved. He was transferred to our department for tracheostomy tube decannulation and swallowing function improvement.

**Clinical Diagnoses:**  
1.  Recovery phase of intracerebral hemorrhage  
2.  Pulmonary infection  
3.  Type I respiratory failure  
4.  Tracheostomized status  
5.  Hypertension, Grade 3 (very high-risk group)  
6.  Nutritional risk

**Functional Diagnoses:**  
1.  Dysphagia  
2.  Pulmonary dysfunction  
3.  Dysarthria  
4.  Physical motor dysfunction  
5.  Balance dysfunction  
6.  Activities of daily living (ADL) impairment

## II. Functional Assessment

### 1. Swallowing Function Assessment

*   **Swallowing Screening (February 12, 2023):**
    *   EAT-10 score: 36 points.
    *   Repetitive Saliva Swallowing Test (RSST): Laryngeal elevation amplitude < 2cm; 1 swallow/30 seconds.
    *   Modified Water Swallowing Test (MWST): Grade 5.
    *   Dye Test: Positive.

*   **Clinical Assessment (February 12, 2023):**
    *   **Orofacial Function:** Incomplete lip closure, severe drooling, asymmetrical lip retraction, inability to puff cheeks.
    *   **Mandible:** Frequently relaxed and drooping at rest.
    *   **Tongue:** Mild right-sided atrophy, incomplete lateral movements.
    *   **Soft Palate:** Insufficient elevation.
    *   **Relevant Reflexes:** Absent gag reflex, absent pharyngeal reflex, delayed and weakened cough reflex.
    *   **Laryngeal Function:** Unable to vocalize due to tracheostomy; delayed and weakened voluntary cough/voluntary throat clearing.
    *   **Feeding Assessment:** Volume-Viscosity Swallow Test (V-VST) indicated impaired safety and efficacy for low-viscosity food (3mL), medium-viscosity food (5mL), and high-viscosity food (10mL).

*   **Instrumental Assessment (February 13, 2023):**
    *   **① Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES):** Revealed incomplete velopharyngeal closure, weakened pharyngeal wall and tongue base movement. Significant residue in epiglottic vallecula (Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale Grade 2) and pyriform sinuses (Yale Grade 2) with medium-viscosity and high-viscosity food (3mL). Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) Grade 8: Material enters the airway, below the vocal folds, with no effort to clear. Overall assessment: Dysphagia severity Grade 2, Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) Level 2.
    *   **② Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS):** Showed significantly delayed swallow initiation, poor oral control, and transport disorder. Significant aspiration (PAS Grade 8: Material enters airway below vocal folds, no effort to clear) with medium-viscosity (3mL, 5mL) and high-viscosity (3mL, 5mL) food. Epiglottic vallecula residue Yale Grade 4 (vallecula filled to brim, epiglottic petiole covered); pyriform sinus residue Yale Grade 3 (25% of pyriform sinus height filled). Absent cough reflex, poor cough strength; unable to clear material completely even with prompting. Partial food retention in mid-to-lower esophagus. Overall assessment: ① Oropharyngeal and esophageal phase dysphagia; ② Silent aspiration.

### 2. Respiratory Function Assessment (February 13, 2023)

*   Patient is tracheostomized. Breathing pattern: Thoracoabdominal. Respiratory rate: 22 breaths/minute. Oxygen saturation maintained at 95%~98% with supplemental oxygen at 3L/min.
*   Significant upper airway rhonchi present.
*   Diaphragmatic ultrasound: Diaphragm thickness 1.57mm, diaphragmatic excursion 0.8cm.
*   Assessment Conclusion: Significant airway clearance disorder, abnormal breathing pattern, reduced chest wall mobility, inadequate respiratory muscle strength, decreased exercise tolerance.

### 3. Psychological and Cognitive-Language Assessment (February 12, 2023)

*   Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): 19 points, indicating moderate cognitive impairment.
*   Functional Assessment of Dysarthria (FAD): 2 points, indicating severe dysarthria.
*   Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA): 13 points.
*   Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD): 16 points.

### 4. Nutritional Function Assessment (February 12, 2023)

*   **Anthropometric Measurements:** Height 176cm, weight 52kg, BMI 16.79 (Underweight).
*   **Nutritional Screening:** Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) score: 4 points.
*   **Nutritional Assessment:** Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) rating: B (Moderate or suspected malnutrition).

### 5. Nursing Assessment (February 12, 2023)

*   **Airway Status:** Tracheostomized, cuff pressure maintained at 20~25kPa.
*   **Oral Hygiene:** Oral cleanliness assessment score: 26 points.
