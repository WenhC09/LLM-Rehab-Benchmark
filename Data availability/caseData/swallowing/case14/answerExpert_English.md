### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

**Short-term Goals (2 weeks):**  
Improve patient’s sputum expectoration ability and tolerance of speaking valve for approximately 2 hours. Reduce pharyngeal residue by enhancing oral sensation and tongue muscle strength. Achieve daily oral intake of 50g hydrogel.

**Mid-term Goals (6 weeks):**  
Significantly enhance cough and expectoration ability. Achieve daily oral intake of 100g gelled or pureed/minced food per meal. Ultimate goal: Successful decannulation.

**Long-term Goals:**  
Restore safe and independent oral feeding ability, with significant functional improvement across all domains.

### 2. Therapeutic Interventions

**I. Clinical Care & Nutritional Management**  
*   **Underlying Disease Management:**  
    Continue antihypertensives, neurotrophic agents, Acetylcysteine nebulization for expectoration, and Piperacillin-Tazobactam for anti-infection. Adjunctive therapy based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome differentiation.  
*   **Nutritional Management:**  
    Provide enteral nutrition support targeting daily intake: 2040 kcal, 1650 ml fluids, 55g protein, and 25–30g dietary fiber.  
*   **Specialized Therapies:**  
    *   **Bronchoalveolar Lavage:**  
        Perform fiberoptic bronchoscopic lavage by respiratory intensivist to clear airway secretions, maintain patency, and improve pulmonary ventilation.  
    *   **TCM Acupuncture:**  
        *   *Tongue Acupuncture:*  
            Lianquan (CV23) for peripheral nerve stimulation; Fengchi (GB20), Jinjin (EX-HN12), Yuye (EX-HN13) to enhance tongue perfusion; Tian’e (Extra), Ezhong (Extra) to facilitate soft palate elevation; electrical stimulation of "Three Tongue Needles" (genioglossus) to promote tongue protrusion.  
        *   *Cervical Acupuncture (项针, Xiàngzhēn):*  
            Stimulate cervical acupoints to regulate meridians and enhance swallowing function via visceral-neural modulation.  

**II. Rehabilitation Therapy Management**  
*   **Basic Swallowing Training:**  
    *   *Oral Sensory Stimulation:*  
        Cold/thermal-tactile stimulation, air-pulse therapy, tongue pressure resistance training, Deep Pharyngeal Neuromuscular Stimulation (DPNS), and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to improve pharyngeal sensation, cough reflex, laryngeal elevation, and swallow initiation.  
    *   *Oral Motor Training:*  
        Passive tongue mobilization with tongue retractor + electromyographic biofeedback; active/resistive exercises (Masako maneuver, isometric lingual resistance) for strength/stability; rapid tongue protrusion/lateralization/circumduction/object manipulation for agility; soft palate cold stimulation, blowing exercises (whistling, paper rolls), and /ka/, /ga/ phonation for palatal elevation.  
    *   *Airway Protection Training:*  
        Mendelsohn maneuver, supraglottic swallow, and Shaker exercise to reduce aspiration/penetration.  
    *   *Sialorrhea Control:*  
        *   Ultrasound-guided Botulinum Toxin Type A injection (total 100U) into parotid/submandibular glands.  
        *   Kinesio taping: "Y"-strip anchored pre-tragus, extending to mandible and upper lip; ≥12h/day.  

*   **Respiratory & Phonatory Training:**  
    *   *External Diaphragm Pacing:*  
        Transcutaneous phrenic nerve stimulation to augment diaphragmatic contraction, thoracic expansion, and tidal volume.  
    *   *Respiratory Strength/Coordination:*  
        Therapist-guided diaphragmatic breathing and respiratory gymnastics.  
    *   *Cough Training:*  
        Huffing technique for cough compensation; therapist-assisted abdominal thrust (inward-downward subdiaphragmatic pressure) during cough to enhance efficacy, progressing to independent productive cough.  
    *   *Airway Clearance Techniques:*  
        Active Cycle of Breathing Technique (ACBT) and oscillatory Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) to mobilize/deep-secretions via expiratory airflow vibration.  

*   **Catheter Balloon Dilation:**  
    Seated patient; catheter placed transorally below cricopharyngeus; 3ml water-inflated balloon dilation; 1 session/day (6–10 reps/session, ~30 min) to improve swallow-respiratory coordination.  

*   **Cerebellar Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS):**  
    10Hz stimulation at 2.5cm below inion, 4.3cm lateral; 250 pulses/session, 30 min/session to modulate cerebellar cortical function.  

*   **Speaking Valve & Subglottic Positive Pressure:**  
    *   *Speaking Valve Use:*  
        Restore physiological upper airway flow, enhance secretion awareness, and reduce aspiration via voluntary throat clearing.  
    *   *Subglottic Positive Pressure:*  
        Further synchronize swallow-respiration, reconstruct physiological airway, and improve pulmonary function.  

*   **Therapeutic Feeding Training:**  
    Individualized protocol with informed consent. Initiate with hydrogel (30ml/meal, 1 meal/day) in upright position. Progress texture: puree → minced → soft solids → regular diet per functional recovery.  

*   **Strength & Endurance Training:**  
    Use tilt table, limb linkage trainer, and exoskeleton robotics to enhance global endurance.  

*   **Comprehensive Rehabilitation:**  
    Concurrent activities of daily living (ADL) training, balance exercises, and upper-limb robot-assisted therapy.

### 3. Rehabilitation Nursing Management  

*   **Oral Care:**  
    Routine oral assessment; twice-daily cleaning with closed-suction system + irrigation to reduce bacterial colonization and facilitate decannulation.  
*   **Airway Management:**  
    High-flow heated humidification + modified postural drainage + mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for secretion clearance and pneumonia prevention.  
*   **Feeding Management:**  
    *   *Phase 1:* Continuous enteral feeding pump + TCM "Fire Dragon Cupping" (火龙罐, Huǒlóngguàn) for abdominal massage/thermotherapy to regulate gastrointestinal function.  
    *   *Phase 2:* Transition to intermittent tube feeding + oral intake → full oral feeding.  
*   **Positioning:**  
    >30° head elevation; scheduled repositioning/percussion; verticalization via tilt table to prevent hypostatic pneumonia.  
*   **Health Education:**  
    *   Instruct patient/family on aspiration precautions.  
    *   Implement TCM emotional regulation therapy for psychological support.  
    *   Educate on feeding environment, positioning, utensil selection, bite volume control, and postprandial monitoring.  
    *   Train family in Heimlich maneuver for emergency response.
