# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2–4 weeks)
1. **Airway and Respiratory Function**
   - Maintain airway patency, reduce airway secretions, and improve airway clearance ability.
   - Improve diaphragmatic movement and respiratory muscle strength.
   - Achieve stable spontaneous breathing with reduced oxygen flow, preparing for tracheostomy decannulation.

2. **Swallowing Function**
   - Reduce aspiration risk through compensatory techniques and targeted exercises.
   - Improve orofacial muscle strength and tongue mobility.
   - Progress FOIS from Level 2 to Level 3–4 (partial oral intake of thickened fluids with non-oral supplementation).

3. **Speech and Communication**
   - Initiate alternative communication and articulation training to improve intelligibility.
   - Begin vocalization training with speaking valve trials after airway safety is confirmed.

4. **Motor and Balance Function**
   - Improve sitting balance and trunk control to facilitate participation in ADL training.
   - Prevent joint contractures and muscle atrophy through passive/active-assisted ROM exercises.

5. **Nutrition**
   - Prevent further weight loss and correct malnutrition through enteral nutrition optimization.
   - Begin safe oral feeding trials for high-viscosity foods under supervision.

6. **Psychological and Cognitive**
   - Stabilize mood, reduce anxiety/depression symptoms.
   - Improve orientation, attention, and basic executive function.

### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
1. **Airway and Respiratory Function**
   - Achieve tracheostomy decannulation with stable spontaneous breathing and effective cough.
   - Restore near-normal respiratory pattern and exercise tolerance suitable for daily activities.

2. **Swallowing Function**
   - Achieve safe oral intake of a variety of textures without aspiration, FOIS Level ≥5.
   - Discontinue tube feeding.

3. **Speech and Communication**
   - Regain functional verbal communication with intelligible speech in daily interactions.

4. **Motor and Balance Function**
   - Achieve independence or minimal assistance in basic mobility and ADLs.
   - Walk with or without assistive devices safely indoors.

5. **Nutrition**
   - Achieve BMI ≥18.5 with adequate protein-energy intake via oral feeding.

6. **Psychological and Cognitive**
   - Achieve emotional stability and improved cognitive performance for independent living.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Respiratory Function Training
- **Airway Management:**  
  - Continue regular suctioning with sterile technique; monitor secretions and infection signs.
  - Humidified oxygen therapy; maintain cuff pressure at 20–25kPa.
- **Airway Clearance Techniques:**  
  - Mechanical vibration and manual percussion postural drainage, 2–3 times/day.  
  - Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation if available.
- **Respiratory Muscle Training:**  
  - Diaphragmatic breathing exercises with visual feedback, 10–15 min, 3–4 times/day.  
  - Incentive spirometry and threshold inspiratory muscle trainer as tolerated.
- **Speaking Valve Trials:**  
  - Initiate after confirming upper airway patency and secretion control; start with short sessions.

### B. Swallowing Rehabilitation
- **Compensatory Strategies:**  
  - Maintain upright posture during and after feeding (≥30 min).  
  - Use chin-tuck posture during swallowing trials.  
  - Administer high-viscosity bolus (thickened liquids/purees) under therapist supervision.
- **Orofacial and Tongue Exercises:**  
  - Lip closure, cheek puff, tongue elevation/lateralization, resistance exercises, 2–3 times/day.
- **Laryngeal Elevation Exercises:**  
  - Mendelsohn maneuver and effortful swallow (dry trials initially).
- **Sensory Stimulation:**  
  - Cold thermal-tactile stimulation to faucial pillars before swallowing trials.
- **FEES/VFSS-guided Upgrading:**  
  - Regular reassessment to adjust bolus volume/viscosity.

### C. Speech and Communication Training
- **Alternative Communication:**  
  - Utilize writing boards or picture cards.
- **Articulation and Phonation:**  
  - Begin with isolated sound production, progressing to syllables and words.
  - Voice therapy with speaking valve trials as tolerated.

### D. Motor and Balance Rehabilitation
- **Positioning and Passive ROM:**  
  - Daily passive ROM for all joints to prevent contracture.
- **Bed Mobility and Transfers:**  
  - Gradual progression from assisted sitting at edge of bed to dynamic sitting balance activities.
- **Strengthening:**  
  - Active-assisted limb exercises focusing on antigravity muscles.
- **Balance Training:**  
  - Static and dynamic sitting balance; progress to supported standing as tolerated.

### E. Nutritional Support
- **Enteral Nutrition Optimization:**  
  - Energy: 30–35 kcal/kg/day; Protein: 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day.
- **Micronutrient Supplementation:**  
  - Vitamins, minerals as per deficiency risk.
- **Transition to Oral Feeding:**  
  - Gradual increase in oral trials under supervision, monitor for aspiration signs.

### F. Psychological and Cognitive Rehabilitation
- **Cognitive Training:**  
  - Orientation, memory, and attention exercises.
- **Psychological Support:**  
  - Counseling, family involvement, and possible pharmacologic treatment for depression/anxiety if indicated.

### G. Nursing Care
- Maintain oral hygiene with antiseptic mouthwash and mechanical cleaning twice daily.
- Monitor skin integrity, especially over pressure points.
- Educate caregivers on airway management, nutrition, and safe swallowing techniques.

### H. Safety and Monitoring
- Regular monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation.
- Watch for signs of aspiration pneumonia.
- Adjust rehabilitation intensity based on fatigue, respiratory status, and neurological recovery.
