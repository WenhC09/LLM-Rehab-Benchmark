## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Respiratory Rehabilitation
1.  **Airway Clearance:** Continue regular suctioning as needed. Implement manual techniques such as postural drainage, percussion, and vibration twice daily to mobilize secretions, coordinated with nursing.
2.  **Respiratory Muscle Training (RMT):**
    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing:** Manual cues and biofeedback to facilitate diaphragmatic movement and correct thoracoabdominal breathing pattern.
    *   **Inspiratory/Expiratory Muscle Training (IMT/EMT):** Begin with low-resistance training once the patient can cooperate, aiming to improve diaphragmatic thickness and respiratory muscle strength.
3.  **Tracheostomy Weaning Protocol:**
    *   **Cuff Deflation Trials:** Initiate systematic, monitored cuff deflation trials, starting with short durations and gradually increasing as tolerated. Monitor SpO2, respiratory rate, and signs of distress.
    *   **Speaking Valve Trials:** Once cuff deflation is tolerated for extended periods and saliva management improves, trial a one-way speaking valve to restore glottic airflow, improve sensation, facilitate phonation, and strengthen cough.
    *   **Capping Trials:** Progress to capping trials as a final step before considering decannulation.

### B. Swallowing Rehabilitation
1.  **Strict NPO Status:** Patient is to receive all nutrition and hydration via the nasogastric-jejunal tube. No oral intake of food, drink, or medication is permitted due to high risk of silent aspiration (PAS 8).
2.  **Indirect Therapy (without food):**
    *   **Oral Motor Exercises:** Active and passive exercises for lips (closure, retraction), cheeks (puffing), jaw (opening/closing), and tongue (protrusion, lateralization, elevation) to address weakness and asymmetry. 3 times/day.
    *   **Pharyngeal and Laryngeal Strengthening:**
        *   **Shaker Exercise (Head Lift):** To strengthen suprahyoid muscles and improve laryngeal elevation.
        *   **Mendelsohn Maneuver:** To prolong and enhance laryngeal elevation (initially simulated, then with saliva swallow).
        *   **Effortful Swallow:** To increase tongue base retraction and pharyngeal pressure.
    *   **Vocal Fold Adduction Exercises:** Pushing/pulling exercises and effortful phonation (once speaking valve is in place) to improve glottic closure and airway protection.
3.  **Sensory Stimulation:**
    *   **Thermal-Tactile Stimulation (TTS):** Apply a chilled laryngeal mirror to the faucial arches to heighten sensory awareness and attempt to trigger a faster swallow reflex.
    *   **Oral Sensory Enhancement:** Use various textures and temperatures (e.g., lemon swabs, ice chips for sensory input only, not for swallowing) to stimulate oral sensation.
4.  **Re-evaluation:** Progress will be closely monitored. A repeat FEES will be performed in 3-4 weeks or sooner if clinical improvement is noted, to reassess pharyngeal function and aspiration risk before considering any therapeutic oral trials.

### C. Nutritional Support
1.  **Enteral Nutrition:** Continue feeding via nasogastric-jejunal tube. Collaborate with the clinical nutritionist to formulate a high-protein, high-calorie feeding plan (Target: ~1600-1800 kcal/day, 75-85g protein/day) to promote tissue repair and weight gain.
2.  **Monitoring:** Monitor weight twice weekly, fluid balance, and relevant laboratory parameters (albumin, prealbumin).
3.  **Oral Hygiene:** Aggressive oral care protocol implemented by nursing staff at least 3-4 times daily to reduce bacterial load and risk of aspiration pneumonia from colonized secretions.

### D. Physical Therapy (PT)
1.  **Passive and Active-Assisted Range of Motion (PROM/AAROM):** For all four limbs, especially the paretic right side, to prevent contractures and maintain joint mobility.
2.  **Bed Mobility Training:** Rolling, scooting, and bridging to improve independence and assist with nursing care.
3.  **Neuromuscular Re-education and Cerebellar Ataxia Management:**
    *   Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) techniques.
    *   Exercises focusing on stability and controlled movement to manage right-sided limb and truncal ataxia.
4.  **Balance and Postural Control:** Progress from static sitting balance on a firm surface to dynamic sitting activities (e.g., reaching).
5.  **Transfer Training:** Begin with dependent transfers, progressing to sit-to-stand training and pivot transfers as lower limb strength and balance improve.

### E. Occupational Therapy (OT)
1.  **Upper Limb Functional Training:** Focus on the right upper limb with task-oriented training, sensory re-education, and splinting if necessary to maintain hand position.
2.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Training:** Begin with basic ADLs such as grooming and upper body dressing at the bedside, using compensatory techniques and adaptive equipment as needed.
3.  **Cognitive Rehabilitation:** Implement structured cognitive exercises targeting attention, orientation, and memory, integrated into functional tasks. Use simple, clear instructions.

### F. Speech and Language Therapy (SLT)
1.  **Dysarthria Management:**
    *   Continue oral motor exercises to improve strength and coordination of articulators.
    *   Once a speaking valve is tolerated, begin respiratory-phonatory coordination exercises and articulation drills.
2.  **Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC):** Immediately implement a low-tech AAC system (e.g., picture/alphabet board) to facilitate communication of basic needs, reduce frustration, and improve participation in care.

### G. Psychological Intervention
1.  **Supportive Psychotherapy:** Regular sessions to address anxiety and depression, build rapport, and provide emotional support.
2.  **Patient and Family Education:** Provide clear education to the patient and family regarding the nature of the deficits (especially silent aspiration), the rationale for the NPO status, the rehabilitation plan, and realistic short-term and long-term goals.
3.  **Behavioral Activation:** Encourage participation in therapies and simple leisure activities to combat depressive symptoms.
4.  **Pharmacological Consultation:** Liaise with the primary medical team to consider initiating antidepressant/anxiolytic medication if mood symptoms do not improve with non-pharmacological interventions.
