# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (2-4 weeks):
- Achieve tracheostomy decannulation criteria through improved airway protection
- Transition from FOIS Level 2 to Level 4 (consistent oral intake of single-consistency foods)
- Reduce vallecular residue from Yale Scale Grade 4 to Grade 2
- Increase diaphragm excursion to ≥1.2cm
- Improve voluntary cough strength to enable secretion clearance
- Attain cuff deflation tolerance for Passy-Muir valve trials
- Achieve independent sitting balance for 5 minutes
- Increase BMI to 17.5 through nutritional intervention

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve safe oral intake without aspiration (FOIS Level 7)
- Restore functional phonation and verbal communication
- Establish independent airway clearance without tracheostomy
- Attain assisted ambulation with single-point cane
- Achieve modified independence in basic ADL (Barthel Index ≥60)
- Reach BMI >18.5 with stable nutritional status
- Return to home environment with caregiver support

## 2. Treatment Methods
### Swallowing Rehabilitation
- **Airway Protection Protocol**: 
  - Tracheostomy cuff deflation trials with blue dye testing
  - Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation device for secretion clearance
  - Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) with calibrated device
- **Pharyngeal Stimulation**:
  - Thermal-tactile stimulation using iced laryngeal mirror
  - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to suprahyoid muscles
  - Mendelsohn maneuver training with surface EMG biofeedback
- **Bolus Control Strategies**:
  - Chin tuck against resistance exercises
  - Effortful swallow technique training with 3ml honey-thick liquids
  - Tongue base retraction exercises using tongue depressors
- **Sensory-Motor Re-education**:
  - Carbonated liquid stimulation to enhance pharyngeal sensitivity
  - Shaker exercise protocol for UES opening
  - Masako maneuver with resistance bands

### Respiratory Rehabilitation
- **Breathing Retraining**:
  - Threshold IMT at 30% MIP starting at 10cmH₂O
  - Pursed-lip breathing with spirometry feedback
  - Diaphragmatic pacing using ultrasound biofeedback
- **Secretion Management**:
  - Active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) with oscillatory PEP
  - High-frequency chest wall oscillation therapy
  - Manual rib springing for thoracic expansion
- **Oxygenation Optimization**:
  - Prone positioning protocol 2hrs BID
  - Interval-based inspiratory hold training

### Motor Rehabilitation
- **Bed Mobility Program**:
  - Bridging exercises with resistance bands
  - Trunk rotation control training in side-lying
- **Balance Re-education**:
  - Weight-shifting exercises on tilt board
  - Perturbation-based standing balance training
- **Limb Function Recovery**:
  - Constraint-induced movement therapy for right upper extremity
  - Body weight-supported treadmill training

### Nutritional & Medical Management
- **Calorie-Protein Optimization**:
  - High-protein modular supplements via NGJ tube (1.5g/kg/day)
  - Omega-3 enriched formulas for anti-inflammatory effects
- **Hydration Protocol**:
  - Thickened water protocol (800ml/day) under VFSS guidance
  - Subcutaneous hydration supplementation PRN
- **Blood Pressure Control**:
  - Daily orthostatic BP monitoring
  - Medication timing synchronization with therapy sessions

### Cognitive-Communication Therapy
- **Dysarthria Management**:
  - Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD)
  - Palatal lift training with intraoral stimulation
- **Cognitive Remediation**:
  - Errorless learning approach for ADL retraining
  - Spaced retrieval training for procedural memory

### Nursing & Adjunctive Care
- **Tracheostomy Care Protocol**:
  - Cuff pressure monitoring Q4H
  - Humidification system with HME filter
- **Oral Hygiene Regimen**:
  - Chlorhexidine swabs TID with toothbrush vibration
  - Ice massage to facial muscles pre-oral care
- **Skin Integrity Protocol**:
  - Alternating pressure mattress with Q2H repositioning
  - Silicone foam dressings over bony prominences

> *All interventions to be delivered in 45-min sessions twice daily, with vital sign monitoring pre/post treatment. Weekly reassessment of swallowing (FEES), respiratory (ultrasound), and functional status to guide progression.*
