# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (1–3 months):
- Improve swallowing safety and efficacy to achieve Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) Level 4 (total oral intake with specific food consistencies and special preparation).
- Enhance airway clearance and respiratory muscle strength to support tracheostomy decannulation.
- Increase respiratory rate stability and oxygen saturation without supplemental oxygen to ≥95%.
- Improve dysarthria to Functional Assessment of Dysarthria (FAD) score ≥4 (moderate dysarthria).
- Enhance nutritional status to Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) rating A (well-nourished) and BMI ≥18.5.
- Improve physical motor function to reduce balance dysfunction and enhance basic mobility (e.g., sitting balance, transfers).
- Increase activities of daily living (ADL) independence (e.g., self-feeding with adaptive equipment).

### Long-term Goals (3–12 months):
- Achieve safe and effective oral intake for a regular diet (FOIS Level 6–7) with minimal to no aspiration risk.
- Restore respiratory function to allow tracheostomy decannulation and maintain stable breathing without supplemental oxygen.
- Improve dysarthria to FAD score ≥6 (mild dysarthria) for functional communication.
- Optimize nutritional status to maintain BMI ≥20 and eliminate nutritional risk (NRS-2002 score <3).
- Regain functional mobility and balance for ambulation with minimal assistance and improve ADL independence to modified independence.
- Address cognitive and psychological impairments to achieve Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≥24 and reduce Hamilton Anxiety (HAMA) and Depression (HAMD) scores to <7.

  - Oral motor exercises to strengthen tongue and lip coordination (10 repetitions/exercise, 3 sets).
- **Compensatory Strategies:**
  - Use of augmentative communication devices (e.g., picture boards) during early recovery.
  - Slow, exaggerated speech to improve clarity during therapy.
- **Monitoring and Progression:**
  - Weekly reassessment using Functional Assessment of Dysarthria (FAD) score.
