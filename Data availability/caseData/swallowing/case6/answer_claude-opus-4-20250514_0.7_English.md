# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
### Short-term goals:
- Improve swallowing safety and efficacy to achieve FOIS Level 2 within 4 weeks.
- Enhance voice quality and increase maximum phonation time to at least 5 seconds within 4 weeks.
- Increase right upper limb muscle strength to Grade 5 and right lower limb muscle strength to Grade 4 within 8 weeks.
- Improve balance and reduce fall risk, achieving a standing balance level of at least Level 3 within 8 weeks.

### Long-term goals:
- Achieve independent ambulation with a walking aid within 12 weeks.
- Attain a normal swallowing function (FOIS Level 7) and eliminate aspiration risk within 12 weeks.
- Restore voice quality to a functional level (VHI score < 10) within 12 weeks.
- Improve nutritional status to a BMI of at least 20 within 12 weeks.

## 2. Treatment Methods:
### A. Swallowing Rehabilitation:
- **Therapeutic Exercises**: Implement orofacial and swallowing exercises to strengthen lip closure, tongue mobility, and laryngeal elevation.
- **Swallowing Techniques**: Introduce compensatory strategies such as chin tuck and head turn during swallowing to enhance safety.
- **Diet Modification**: Gradually introduce thickened liquids and pureed foods, monitoring for safety and efficacy.
- **Nutritional Support**: Collaborate with a dietitian to provide high-calorie, high-protein supplements to address hypoproteinemia and underweight status.

### B. Voice Rehabilitation:
- **Voice Therapy**: Engage in vocal exercises focusing on breath support, resonance, and phonation techniques to improve voice quality.
- **Laryngeal Massage**: Utilize manual techniques to reduce tension in the laryngeal muscles and improve vocal cord function.
- **Acoustic Monitoring**: Regularly assess maximum phonation time and voice quality to track progress and adjust therapy as needed.

### C. Motor Rehabilitation:
- **Strength Training**: Implement progressive resistance exercises for the right upper and lower limbs to enhance muscle strength.
- **Functional Mobility Training**: Focus on gait training with assistive devices, balance exercises, and task-specific training to promote independent ambulation.
- **Neuromuscular Re-education**: Use proprioceptive and balance training techniques to improve coordination and stability.

### D. Respiratory Rehabilitation:
- **Breathing Exercises**: Introduce diaphragmatic and pursed-lip breathing exercises to enhance respiratory function and cough strength.
- **Airway Clearance Techniques**: Employ techniques such as huff coughing and chest physiotherapy to facilitate sputum clearance.

### E. Nutritional Management:
- **Regular Monitoring**: Conduct weekly assessments of weight, dietary intake, and nutritional status.
- **Education**: Provide education on the importance of nutrition in recovery and strategies for maintaining adequate intake.

### F. Multidisciplinary Approach:
- **Team Collaboration**: Involve speech therapists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, dietitians, and nursing staff in the rehabilitation process to ensure comprehensive care.
- **Family Involvement**: Educate and involve family members in the rehabilitation process to support the patientâ€™s recovery at home.

### G. Follow-up and Reassessment:
- Schedule regular follow-up assessments every 2 weeks to monitor progress towards goals and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.
