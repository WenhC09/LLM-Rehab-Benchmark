# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (4-6 weeks)

*   **Swallowing & Nutrition:**
    *   Maintain NPO status to ensure safety and prevent aspiration pneumonia.
    *   Improve nutritional status: Correct hypoproteinemia and achieve a target BMI of â‰¥18.5 through optimized nasogastric tube feeding.
    *   Improve oral hygiene score to <10 (Good hygiene) through a strict oral care protocol.
    *   Enhance oral-pharyngeal motor control: Improve lip closure to Grade A and increase laryngeal elevation to >1 cm during dry swallows.
    *   Initiate therapeutic trials of trace amounts (e.g., 1mL) of high-viscosity puree under direct therapist supervision, without signs of aspiration.

*   **Respiratory & Voice:**
    *   Increase maximum phonation time (MPT) to >5 seconds.
    *   Improve cough effectiveness to produce a forceful, productive cough on command.
    *   Improve glottic closure during phonation attempts to reduce breathiness.

*   **Motor & Balance:**
    *   Improve right lower limb muscle strength to Grade 4/5.
    *   Achieve independent static standing balance for at least 1 minute without support.
    *   Achieve the ability to transfer from bed to chair with minimal assistance.
    *   Improve right-hand grasp and release for holding a cup.

### Long-term goals (3-6 months)

*   **Swallowing & Nutrition:**
    *   Achieve safe oral intake of a modified texture diet (e.g., puree or minced & moist consistency) without aspiration, progressing to FOIS Level 3-4.
    *   Discontinue nasogastric tube feeding.
    *   Maintain adequate hydration and nutrition via oral intake.

*   **Respiratory & Voice:**
    *   Achieve intelligible, functional communication at the sentence level.
    *   Reduce VHI score by at least 50%.
    *   Achieve a functional, effective cough for independent airway clearance.

*   **Motor & Balance:**
    *   Achieve independent ambulation with a quad cane for at least 20 meters on level surfaces.
    *   Improve right upper limb coordination to perform simple activities of daily living (e.g., self-feeding with adapted utensils, basic grooming).
    *   Improve dynamic standing balance to safely navigate household environments.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### I. Dysphagia Rehabilitation

*   **Status:** Strict NPO (Nothing by Mouth). All nutrition and hydration to be provided via the nasogastric tube.
*   **Compensatory Strategies:**
    *   Patient and caregiver education on aspiration precautions.
    *   Maintain upright posture (90 degrees) during and for 30-60 minutes after any potential therapeutic oral trials.
*   **Rehabilitative Training (5 times/week):**
    *   **Oral Motor Exercises:** Lip closure/pursing against resistance, tongue strengthening exercises (pushing against a tongue depressor in all directions), and range of motion exercises.
    *   **Laryngeal/Pharyngeal Strengthening:**
        *   **Shaker Exercise (Head-Lifting):** To strengthen suprahyoid muscles, improve laryngeal elevation, and promote cricopharyngeal (UES) opening.
        *   **Mendelsohn Maneuver:** To prolong laryngeal elevation and UES opening during dry swallows.
        *   **Effortful Swallow:** To increase pharyngeal pressure and tongue base retraction.
    *   **Airway Protection Maneuvers:**
        *   **Supraglottic and Super-Supraglottic Swallow:** To be practiced with saliva/dry swallows to improve voluntary vocal cord closure and airway protection, directly addressing the right vocal cord fixation.
*   **Modalities:**
    *   **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES):** Application to the submental (suprahyoid) muscles to facilitate laryngeal elevation during swallowing exercises.
    *   **Thermal-Tactile Stimulation (TTS):** To heighten oral sensory awareness and potentially improve the timeliness of swallow initiation.
*   **Consultation:**
    *   Given the VFSS finding of "complete failure of cricopharyngeal opening," if there is no improvement with the above exercises within 4-6 weeks, a consultation with a gastroenterologist or ENT specialist will be initiated to discuss potential cricopharyngeal Botox injection or myotomy.

### II. Voice & Respiratory Rehabilitation

*   **Respiratory Muscle Training (daily):**
    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing:** To establish an efficient breathing pattern.
    *   **Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST):** Using a pressure-threshold device to improve expiratory force for both cough and voice production.
    *   **Breath Stacking:** To increase inspiratory volume preceding a cough.
*   **Voice Therapy (3-5 times/week):**
    *   **Vocal Function Exercises (VFE):** A structured program to improve the efficiency and coordination of the laryngeal system.
    *   **Effortful Closure Techniques:** Pushing/pulling exercises or glottal attack exercises to promote adduction of the mobile left vocal cord towards the fixed right cord, improving glottic closure.
    *   **Resonant Voice Therapy:** To focus phonation on the anterior oral cavity, reducing laryngeal strain and improving vocal quality.
*   **Consultation:**
    *   Concurrent management with an ENT specialist to monitor the status of the right vocal cord and discuss options such as injection laryngoplasty if conservative voice therapy fails to produce functional voice.

### III. Physical Therapy (Motor, Balance, and Gait)

*   **Strength Training (5 times/week):**
    *   Progressive resistive exercises for the right upper and lower limbs, focusing on anti-gravity muscles (quadriceps, glutes, deltoids).
    *   Closed-chain exercises (e.g., mini-squats, bridging) to improve strength and proprioception.
    *   Core stability exercises.
*   **Balance Training (5 times/week):**
    *   **Static Balance:** Progress from sitting to standing, initially with support (parallel bars) and on a firm surface, progressing to reduced support and compliant surfaces (foam pads).
    *   **Dynamic Balance:** Weight-shifting exercises, reaching in all directions, and controlled stepping drills.
*   **Coordination Training (3-5 times/week):**
    *   **Frenkel's Exercises:** To improve control of limb movements, addressing cerebellar ataxia.
    *   Proprioceptive training and weight-bearing activities for the right side.
*   **Gait Training (daily):**
    *   Pre-gait activities in parallel bars focusing on weight shifting and symmetrical stance.
    *   Progression to overground walking with an appropriate assistive device (initially a walker for stability, progressing to a quad cane as balance improves). Emphasis on safety, step length symmetry, and reducing gait ataxia.

### IV. Nutritional Management and Oral Care

*   **Nutritional Support:**
    *   Immediate consultation with a clinical dietitian to formulate a high-protein, high-calorie nasogastric feeding plan to address the patient's underweight and hypoproteinemic status.
    *   Weekly monitoring of weight, BMI, and serum albumin levels.
*   **Oral Hygiene:**
    *   Implementation of a strict oral care protocol by the nursing team, to be performed at least 3 times daily and after any emesis. This includes teeth brushing, tongue scraping, and cleansing of the oral mucosa with non-alcoholic antiseptic rinse to minimize bacterial load and reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
