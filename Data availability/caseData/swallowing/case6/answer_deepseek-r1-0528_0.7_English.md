# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan  

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals  
### Short-term goals (2-4 weeks):  
- **Swallowing**: Achieve FOIS Level 3 (oral intake of single-consistency pureed foods without aspiration)  
- **Voice**: Increase maximum phonation time to ≥3 seconds, reduce VHI score by 20%  
- **Motor**: Achieve independent standing for 3 minutes, improve right hand grasp to functional grip  
- **Nutrition**: Increase BMI to ≥18.5 through enteral nutrition support  
- **Respiratory**: Attain oxygen saturation ≥98% at rest, improve voluntary cough strength  

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):  
- **Swallowing**: Achieve FOIS Level 6 (full oral diet with minimal restrictions)  
- **Voice**: Restore functional communication ability (VHI ≤20)  
- **Motor**: Achieve independent ambulation with single-point cane indoors  
- **Nutrition**: Maintain BMI >20 with ≥75% oral intake  
- **Functional Independence**: Perform basic ADLs independently  

## 2. Treatment Methods  
### Dysphagia Management  
- **Direct Therapy**:  
  - Thermal-tactile stimulation to trigger swallow reflex  
  - Mendelsohn maneuver training for laryngeal elevation  
  - Effortful swallow exercises to reduce pharyngeal residue  
  - Shaker exercises for cricopharyngeal opening  
- **Compensatory Strategies**:  
  - Chin tuck posture during swallowing trials  
  - Strict NPO status with nasogastric tube feeding  
  - Viscosity trials: Start with honey-thick liquids under VFSS monitoring  
- **Neuromuscular Stimulation**:  
  - Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (VitalStim) to suprahyoid muscles  

### Voice Rehabilitation  
- **Glottal Closure Training**:  
  - Push-pull technique for vocal cord adduction  
  - Laryngeal reposturing exercises  
- **Phonation Therapy**:  
  - Respiratory retraining (diaphragmatic breathing)  
  - Sustained vowel exercises with progressive duration  
  - Voice amplification device for immediate communication  

### Motor Function Training  
- **Right Limb Rehabilitation**:  
  - Progressive resistance training (shoulder/elbow: TheraBand)  
  - Task-specific grasp training (cone manipulation)  
  - Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) for right UE  
- **Balance and Gait**:  
  - Weight-shifting exercises on force platform  
  - Parallel bar training with partial body support  
  - Perturbation-based balance training  

### Nutritional Support  
- **Enteral Nutrition Protocol**:  
  - High-protein formula (1.5g/kg/day)  
  - Night-time cyclic feeding (12-hour regimen)  
  - Daily calorie monitoring (35kcal/kg/day)  
- **Oral Care Regimen**:  
  - Chlorhexidine mouthwash QID  
  - Mechanical tooth cleaning post-feeding  

### Respiratory Management  
- **Cough Enhancement**:  
  - Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) device  
  - Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST 150)  
- **Oxygenation**:  
  - Incentive spirometer training (10 reps/hour while awake)  
  - Pursed-lip breathing exercises  

### Comprehensive Approach  
- **Treatment Frequency**:  
  - Swallow/voice therapy: 40 min BID, 6 days/week  
  - Motor therapy: 60 min QD, 5 days/week  
- **Monitoring Parameters**:  
  - Weekly VFSS for diet advancement  
  - Daily SpO₂ monitoring during therapy  
  - Biweekly limb girth measurements  
- **Precautions**:  
  - Continuous pulse oximetry during initial swallowing trials  
  - Fall prevention protocol during balance training  
  - Strict aspiration precautions (suction at bedside)
