# 1. Rehabilitation Goals

## Short-Term Goals
*   **Phase I (Initial 3 weeks):**
    *   Transition from nasogastric tube feeding to intermittent orogastric tube feeding within 1 week to optimize nutritional route.
    *   Improve cricopharyngeal muscle function and re-establish swallowing reflex within 3 weeks; achieve therapeutic intake of 50mL hydrogel per session, twice daily.
    *   Enhance vocal fold adduction and establish airway protection within 3 weeks.
    *   Achieve standing with walker assistance and improve right upper limb muscle strength/hand grasp within 3 weeks.

*   **Phase II (Weeks 4-6):**
    *   Achieve oral intake of "minced and moist food" to meet basic nutritional needs via intensive feeding training within 3 weeks.
    *   Improve swallowing coordination and reduce pharyngeal residue.
    *   Achieve walker-assisted ambulation and use adaptive chopsticks to pick up "granular" simulated food within 3 weeks.

*   **Phase III (Weeks 7-11):**
    *   Increase maximum phonation time to >5 seconds within 5 weeks.
    *   Reduce frequency of coughing during small-sip water intake.
    *   Improve vocal quality and increase utterance length within 5 weeks.
    *   Achieve safe independent ambulation for 50 meters.

## Long-Term Goals
*   Attain oral intake using right hand with utensils, improving Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) level from 1 to 6.
*   Improve vocal quality to enable effective communication using complete sentences.
*   Achieve independent ambulation.

# 2. Therapeutic Interventions

This rehabilitation strategy employs a precision, individualized approach through integrated medical-therapy-nursing collaboration, tailored to the patient’s functional status across phases.

**Phase I: Improve Cricopharyngeal Opening and Re-establish Swallowing Reflex**

*   **Swallowing Training:**
    *   **Sensory-Motor Training:** Apply Deep Pharyngeal Neuromuscular Stimulation (DPNS) and oral massage/vibrating toothbrush to enhance intraoral sensation and trigger swallowing reflex. Perform resistance training using tongue exercisers and lip strengtheners. Facilitate soft palate elevation via ice stick stimulation coupled with /a/ phonation.
    *   **Laryngeal Elevation/Coordination Training:** Implement Mendelsohn maneuver to increase laryngeal excursion, combined with neuromuscular electrical stimulation for dysphagia to enhance strength/coordination of swallowing muscles.
    *   **Cricopharyngeal Opening Training:** Core intervention: Modified catheter balloon dilation to actively assist cricopharyngeal opening and rebuild swallowing patterns. Adjunct Shaker exercise (head lift) to strengthen upper esophageal sphincter.
    *   **Therapeutic Feeding:** Instruct right head turn posture for consuming 2cm×2cm hydrogel slices, followed by bilateral head turns to clear residue.

*   **Cardiopulmonary & Motor Training:**
    *   **Respiratory Training:** Cough training via deep inhalation followed by trunk flexion/abdominal contraction with forced /ha/ phonation; Diaphragmatic breathing to establish proper breathing-swallowing coordination; Abdominal muscle resistance training.
    *   **Motor Training:** Dynamic standing balance training for ambulation preparation; Right upper limb/wrist-hand strength/endurance training using screwdrivers and grip balls.

*   **Voice Therapy:**
    *   Apply unilateral vocal fold compression to assist adduction.
    *   Implement chair pull technique during phonation to promote vocal fold closure and increase volume.

*   **Nursing & Education:**
    *   Enforce NPO status upon admission; Provide nasogastric tube management, oral care, and psychological counseling.

**Phase II: Enhance Oral Intake Skills and Volume**

*   **Swallowing Training:**
    *   **Airway Protection/Coordination Training:** Apply supraglottic swallow to reduce penetration/aspiration. Introduce biofeedback electrical stimulation to improve swallowing power and sequential swallow endurance. Continue modified balloon dilation to optimize cricopharyngeal opening/swallowing coordination.
    *   **Graded Feeding Progression:** Transition sequentially from 200mL hydrogel intake within 5 minutes to thick liquids, pureed foods, and "minced and moist foods," increasing per-meal volume. Teach compensatory maneuvers (e.g., bilateral head turns) during meals. Supplement nutrition/hydration via intermittent orogastric tube outside therapeutic feeding.

*   **Respiratory & Motor Training:**
    *   **Ambulation/Balance Training:** Walker-assisted step training and step-up/step-down exercises to improve gait balance/weight shift. Enhance coordination via ball toss/catch in standing.
    *   **Respiratory Training:** Active breathing exercises (blowing bubbles/candles) to improve cardiopulmonary function and breath control.
    *   **Fine Motor Training:** Finger coordination exercises using finger ladders; Simulated food manipulation with adaptive chopsticks.

*   **Voice Therapy:**
    *   Use voice amplifiers to improve vocal fold mobility.
    *   Apply hard glottal attack training to increase volume and promote closure.
    *   Prolong maximum phonation time via pursed-lip/diaphragmatic breathing combined with sustained vowel phonation (/a/, /i/).

*   **Nursing & Education:**
    *   Develop detailed feeding/hydration schedule; Monitor daily oral intake; Provide ongoing dysphagia technique guidance and aspiration risk education.

**Phase III: Enhance Vocal Fold Mobility, Vocal Quality, and Safe Hydration**

*   **Swallowing Training:**
    *   Focus on caregiver training: Feeding soft foods with head turns; Using food-thickening agents (e.g., "He Yao Shun") for medication; Chin-tuck position for small-sip water intake (3-5mL/sip); Immediate cessation of feeding if coughing occurs, followed by voluntary cough/throat clear.

*   **Voice Therapy:**
    *   **Respiratory-Phonatory Coordination:** Speech diaphragmatic breathing training, progressing from single words to phrases during exhalation.
    *   **Vocal Fold Physiological Motion:** Specific exercises: ascending/descending glides (/u/), pitch glides (/boom/), scale-based /ol/ phonation (omitting /d/).
    *   **Resonance Training:** Oral resonance and forward-focused voice exercises to reduce vocal fatigue.

*   **Cardiopulmonary & Motor Training:**
    *   Supervised 20-minute daily aerobic walking.
    *   Customized simplified aerobic exercises for limb strength, cardiopulmonary function, and balance.
    *   Intensive training for independent utensil use with right hand under supervision.

*   **Nursing & Education:**
    *   Develop home-based feeding/hydration plan; Educate caregivers on feeding techniques and aspiration risk management for discharge.
