# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4-8 weeks):
- Improve swallowing safety to achieve Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) Level 3 (oral intake of single consistency with modifications).
- Enhance vocal cord function to improve voice clarity and reduce breathiness (target Voice Handicap Index score reduction by 10 points).
- Increase right limb muscle strength to Grade 4+ for upper limb and Grade 4 for lower limb.
- Improve standing balance to Level 3 (able to stand independently with minimal support).
- Optimize nutritional status to achieve BMI ≥ 18.5 and resolve hypoproteinemia.
- Enhance cough strength and sputum clearance to prevent pulmonary complications.

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve FOIS Level 5 (total oral intake with multiple consistencies, minimal restrictions).
- Restore functional voice for conversational speech (VHI score <20, GRBAS Grade ≤1).
- Attain full right limb motor function (muscle strength Grade 5) for activities of daily living (ADLs).
- Achieve independent ambulation with minimal balance impairment (Standing Balance Level 4).
- Maintain stable respiratory function with no recurrent infections.
- Normalize nutritional status (BMI 20-22) and maintain adequate oral hygiene.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Swallowing Rehabilitation- **Swallowing Therapy (Speech-Language Pathologist, 5 sessions/week, 30-45 min)**:
  - **Orofacial Muscle Training Exercises to strengthen lip closure, movement, and soft palate elevation (e.g., lip pursing, tongue resistance exercises, effortful swallow). Focus on right-side deficits.
  - **Swallowing Maneuvers**: Supraglottic swallow and Mendelsohn maneuver to improve elevation and cricopharyngeal opening. Practice with small volumes (3L) of high-viscos foods under supervision.
  -Thermal-Tactile Stimulation**: Apply cold stimulation to anterior faucial pillars to enhance swallow initiation (10 repetitions/session).
  - **Compensatory Strategies**: Chin-tuck posture during swallowing to reduce residue and improve safety. Use thickened liquids (Level 2-3 viscosity) to minimize choking risk.
  - **Diet Modification**: Maintain nasogastric tube feeding (1,800-2,000 kcal/day, high-protein formula). Gradual introduction of high-viscosity pureed foods (3-5mL boluses) ifSS shows improved clearance.
  - **Monitoring**: Weekly clinical swallowing assessments; repeat VFSS in 4 weeks to evaluate progress in cricopharyngeal opening and residue clearance.

### Voice Rehabilitation
- **Voice Therapy (Speech-Language Pathologist, 3 sessions/week, 30 min)**:
  - **V Cord Adduction Exercises**: Pushing/pulling exercises and vocal function exercises (e.g., sustained phonation, pitch glides) to improve glottic closure and reduce breathiness.
  - **Respiratory Support Training**: Diaphragmatic breathing exercises to enhance phonation time (target >5 seconds).
  - **Vocal Hygiene Education**: Avoid vocal strain, ensure adequate hydration (2L/day), and minimize throat clearing.
  - **Monitoring**: Weekly GRBAS and VHI to track voice quality improvements.

### Motor Function Rehabilitation
- **Physical Therapy (Physiotherapist, 5 sessions/week, 45-60 min)**:
  - **Right Limb Strengthening**: Progressive resistance exercises for right upper and lower limbs (e.g., theraband exercises, weight-bearing activities Focus on functional tasks (e.g., grasping, lifting).
 **Balance Training**: Static balance exercises (e.g., standing with together, single-leg stance with support). Progress to dynamic balance tasks (e.g., weight shifting, step-ups).
  - **Gait Training**: Assisted ambulation with a walker, emphasizing weight-bearing on the right side. Progress to cane use if balance improves to Level 3.
  - **Coordination Exercises**: Upper limb coordination tasks (e.g., ball tossing) to improve right-hand dexterity.
- **Occupational Therapy (3 sessions/week, 30 min)**:
  - Functional tasks to enhance right-hand grasp for ADLs (e.g., buttoning, eating). Use adaptive equipment if needed (e.g.,-up utensils).
  - Task-specific training for fine motor skills (e.g., pegboard exercises).

### Respiratory Rehabilitation
- **Respiratory Therapy (Physiotherapist, 3 sessions/week, 20 min)**:
  - **Cough Training**: Teach huffing and controlled coughing techniques to improve sputum clearance.
  - **Breathing Exercises**: Inspiratory muscle training with a threshold device to enhance cough strength and thoracoabdominal breathing coordination.
  - **Pulmonary Hygiene**: Postural drainage and chest percussion (as needed) to manage sputum. Educate family on manual assistance techniques.
  - **Monitoring**: Weekly sputum assessment and oxygen saturation checks to prevent infections.

### Nutritional and General Management
- **Nutritional Support (Dietitian, weekly consultation)**:
  - Continue nasogastric tube feeding with high-protein, high-calorie formula (1,800-2,000 kcal/day, 80-100g protein/day) to address hypoproteinemia and underweight status.
  - Weekly and serum albumin monitoring to track progress.
  - Gradual to oral feeding based on swallowing progress.
- ** Hygiene (Nursing, daily)**
  - Implement oral care protocolbrushing, antiseptic mouthwash) to improve oral hygiene score to <15.
- **Medical Management**:
  - Continue antihypertensive therapy as prescribed to maintain blood pressure <140/90 mmHg.
  - Monitor for signs of pulmonary infection (e.g., fever, increased sputum). Administer antibiotics if indicated.
  - Address hypoprotein with albumin supplementation if serum levels <30 g/L.

 Additional Considerations
- **Psych Support**: Weekly counseling sessions to address emotional adjustment to functional limitations and promote motivation.
- **Family Education**: Train caregivers on safe feeding techniques, swallowing precautions, and home-based exercises.
- **Multidisciplinary Team Coordination**: Weekly case conferences with neurologist, speech-language pathologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, dietitian, and nursing staff to adjust plan based on progress.
- **Reassessment Schedule**:
  - Swallowing: Weekly clinical exams, VFSS at 4 weeks.
  - Voice: WeeklyBAS and VHI.
  - Motor Function: Biweekly muscle strength and balance assessments.
  - Nutritional Status: Weekly BMI and blood work.
  - Respiratory: Weekly sputum and oxygen saturation checks.
