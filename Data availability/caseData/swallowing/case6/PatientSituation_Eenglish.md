# Medical Record Information

## I. Medical Record Summary

*   **Demographics**: Male, 54 years old, retired civil servant from Tibet.
*   **Chief Complaint**: Dysphagia, hoarseness, and impaired motor function in the right limb for over 5 months.
*   **History of Present Illness**: The patient sustained a fall during morning exercise on April 19, 2020, and was admitted to a local hospital. Head CT revealed "right cerebellar hemisphere contusion and laceration with intracerebral hematoma, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, right occipital bone fracture, skull base fracture with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and otorrhea, left frontal scalp injury, closed chest injury, right radius fracture, and right fibula fracture." Emergency craniotomy for hematoma evacuation and tracheostomy were performed. Postoperatively, the patient was conscious but unable to speak, with impaired motor function in the right limb. Subsequent rehabilitation was conducted at multiple hospitals, during which pulmonary infection occurred. Following treatment, limb function and pulmonary status improved, and the tracheostomy tube was successfully removed. However, significant dysphagia and hoarseness persisted. On September 23, 2020, the patient was admitted to our Neurology Rehabilitation Department for further rehabilitation with the diagnosis of "Recovery Phase of Traumatic Brain Injury." Currently, the patient presents with dysphagia, hoarseness, poor balance, inability to ambulate independently, normal bowel and bladder function, and no significant weight loss.
*   **Clinical Diagnoses**:
    1.  Recovery phase of traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage;
    2.  Pulmonary infection;
    3.  Hypertension;
    4.  Hypoproteinemia.
*   **Functional Diagnoses**:
    1.  Dysphagia;
    2.  Voice disorder;
    3.  Motor impairment of the right limb;
    4.  Balance impairment.

## II. Functional Assessment on Admission

### 1. Respiratory Function Assessment (2020-09-23)
Patient is conscious. Tracheostomy tube removed. Sputum present, thin and white in color; partially expectorated spontaneously, but cough strength is diminished. Thoracoabdominal breathing pattern observed. Respiratory rate: 20 breaths/min. Maximum phonation time: 2 seconds. Resting oxygen saturation maintained at 95%-97%.

### 2. Swallowing Function Assessment (2020-09-23)
*   **(1) Clinical Swallowing Examination**:
    *   ① **Orofacial Function**: Facial symmetry generally preserved. Lip closure and pursing strength: Grade B (diminished). Mandibular movement normal. Soft palate elevation: Grade B (poor elevation on right side). Tongue movement (licking upper/lower lip): Grade B (slightly restricted range in elevation/depression). Other functions normal.
    *   ② **Reflexes**: Absent gag reflex and vomiting reflex on the right side; diminished on the left. Diminished cough reflex.
    *   ③ **Laryngeal Function**: Laryngeal elevation <1cm. Diminished voluntary cough and throat clearing strength. Hoarse voice with audible breathiness.
    *   ④ **Repetitive Saliva Swallowing Test (RSST)**: Abnormal (incomplete swallow, unable to complete).
    *   ⑤ **Water Swallow Test**: Level 5 (obvious coughing/choking observed with 3mL water administered via teaspoon).

*   **(2) Modified Volume-Viscosity Swallow Test (VVST-CV)**:
    Safety and efficacy for consuming 3mL of low-, medium-, and high-viscosity foods were severely impaired:
    *   **Safety**: Coughing/choking occurred with all three viscosities; no oxygen desaturation observed.
    *   **Efficacy**: Food spillage, oral residue, and piecemeal deglutition observed with all three viscosities.
    *   **FOIS (Functional Oral Intake Scale)**: Level 1.

*   **(3) Laryngoscopy (External Hospital Report, 2020-08-27)**:
    Nasopharynx symmetrical bilaterally. Bilateral pharyngeal recesses clear. Mucosa smooth, no masses observed. Nasogastric tube in situ. Bilateral vocal cord surfaces smooth. Right vocal cord fixed. Poor glottic closure.

*   **(4) Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) (External Hospital Report)**:
    Assessment in natural sitting position with 3mL each of medium- and high-viscosity mixed foods:
    *   Slightly impaired head control. Mild impairment in oral transit control. Significantly delayed swallow initiation.
    *   No significant reflux. Significant residue pooled in bilateral valleculae and pyriform sinuses; minimal bolus clearance despite multiple swallowing attempts.
    *   No significant leakage or aspiration. Pharyngeal residue expelled orally after voluntary coughing.
    *   Diminished cough reflex. Cricopharyngeal sphincter failed to open during swallowing.
    *   **Findings**: ① Swallowing dysfunction (oral, pharyngeal, esophageal phases); ② Complete failure of cricopharyngeal opening.

### 3. Voice Function Assessment (2020-09-23)
Hoarse voice quality with marked breathiness. Difficulty speaking in sentences.
*   ① **Perceptual Voice Assessment (GRBAS Scale)**: Overall Grade of Hoarseness (G): 3 (Severe); Roughness (R): 3 (Severe); Breathiness (B): 3 (Severe); Asthenia (A): 2 (Moderate); Strain (S): 0 (Normal).
*   ② **Acoustic Analysis**: Maximum Phonation Time: 0.92 seconds.
*   ③ **Voice Handicap Index (VHI)**: Score 38.

### 4. Motor Function Assessment
Right lower limb muscle strength: Grade 3. Right upper limb muscle strength: Grade 4. Impaired right-hand grasp. Unable to cooperate with Finger-to-Nose and Heel-to-Shin tests on the right side. Positive Romberg's sign. Standing balance: Level 2. Difficulty with independent ambulation.

### 5. Nutritional Assessment
BMI: 17.9 (Underweight). NRS-2002 (Nutritional Risk Screening): Score 4 (Nutritional risk present).

### 6. Nursing Assessment
Oral hygiene score: 20 (Poor hygiene). Significant swallowing problems present.
