# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2–4 weeks)
1. **Swallowing function**: Improve oral motor control, enhance laryngeal elevation, and initiate partial safe swallowing with thickened liquids under supervision; progress FOIS from Level 1 toward Level 2.
2. **Voice function**: Increase maximum phonation time to ≥2 seconds, reduce breathiness, and improve glottic closure through compensatory techniques.
3. **Motor and balance function**: Improve right lower limb muscle strength from Grade 3 toward Grade 4; achieve ability to stand unsupported for ≥1 minute; initiate assisted gait training with parallel bars.
4. **Respiratory function**: Enhance voluntary cough strength, achieve effective airway clearance with minimal assistance.
5. **Nutrition**: Maintain or increase body weight; improve oral hygiene score from 20 toward ≤15 through daily care and education.
6. **Safety**: Prevent aspiration pneumonia and falls.

### Long-term goals (8–12 weeks)
1. **Swallowing function**: Achieve safe and efficient swallowing for modified diet (FOIS Level ≥4); reduce aspiration risk to minimal levels.
2. **Voice function**: Improve voice quality to moderate or mild hoarseness (GRBAS G ≤2), increase maximum phonation time to ≥5 seconds, enhance vocal endurance for daily communication.
3. **Motor and balance function**: Achieve independent indoor ambulation without assistive devices; improve standing balance to Level 4 or higher.
4. **Respiratory function**: Maintain normal oxygen saturation, effective cough, and no recurrent lower respiratory tract infections.
5. **Nutrition**: Achieve BMI ≥19 with balanced nutrition via safe oral intake.
6. **Participation**: Regain ability to perform basic ADLs independently; reintegrate into community activities.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Swallowing Rehabilitation
1. **Direct swallowing therapy** (only with safe food textures under SLP supervision):
   - Begin with high-viscosity paste trials in minimal volumes (≤3 mL) under close monitoring.
   - Use positional strategies (chin tuck, head turn to right) to facilitate safer swallow.
2. **Indirect swallowing therapy**:
   - Oral motor exercises: Lip closure drills, tongue elevation/depression, soft palate elevation training.
   - Thermal-tactile stimulation to trigger swallow reflex.
   - Effortful swallow and Mendelsohn maneuver training to improve laryngeal elevation and cricopharyngeal opening.
3. **Adjunctive modalities**:
   - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to suprahyoid muscles if tolerated and no contraindications.
4. **Compensatory management**:
   - Continue nasogastric feeding until oral intake is safe and adequate.
   - Strict aspiration precautions during therapy and oral care.

### B. Voice Rehabilitation
1. **Respiratory-phonatory coordination training**:
   - Diaphragmatic breathing exercises.
   - Sustained phonation with gradual extension of duration.
2. **Glottic closure techniques**:
   - Push–pull or hard glottal attack exercises to improve closure.
   - Resonant voice therapy adapted for unilateral vocal cord immobility.
3. **Compensatory communication strategies**:
   - Use of gestures, writing, or communication boards when fatigued.
4. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular voice quality reassessment and laryngoscopic evaluation to track progress.

### C. Motor and Balance Rehabilitation
1. **Strength training**:
   - Progressive resistance exercises for right lower limb (hip, knee, ankle).
   - Task-specific training for right upper limb fine motor function.
2. **Balance and coordination**:
   - Static balance training (weight shifting, tandem stance).
   - Dynamic balance in parallel bars; progression to unsupported ambulation.
3. **Gait training**:
   - Start with parallel bars → walker → cane as tolerated.
   - Incorporate stepping strategies and obstacle negotiation.
4. **Neurofacilitation techniques**:
   - Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) patterns for trunk and limb control.

### D. Respiratory Rehabilitation
1. **Breathing exercises**:
   - Incentive spirometry.
   - Segmental breathing focusing on thoracoabdominal coordination.
2. **Airway clearance**:
   - Assisted cough techniques.
   - Huff coughing practice combined with suction if needed.
3. **Vocal fold adduction exercises** to enhance cough effectiveness.

### E. Nutritional Management
1. **Dietitian involvement**:
   - Individualized enteral nutrition plan to meet caloric and protein needs (consider hypoproteinemia).
2. **Oral care protocol**:
   - Oral cleansing at least 3 times/day to reduce aspiration pneumonia risk.
3. **Monitoring**:
   - Weekly weight, NRS-2002 reassessment, serum albumin checks.

### F. Education and Caregiver Training
1. Aspiration precautions and feeding techniques.
2. Home exercise program for swallowing, voice, and limb function.
3. Safe transfer and fall prevention strategies.

### G. Multidisciplinary Coordination
- **Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP)**: Lead swallowing and voice rehabilitation.
- **Physiotherapist**: Lead motor and balance training.
- **Occupational Therapist**: Focus on ADL retraining and fine motor skills.
- **Dietitian**: Oversee nutritional optimization.
- **Nursing**: Implement oral care, positioning, and monitor for aspiration signs.
