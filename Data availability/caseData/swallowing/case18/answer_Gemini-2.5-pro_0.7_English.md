### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-term goals (4-6 weeks):
*   **Airway & Respiration:**
    *   Resolve active pulmonary infection and achieve stable oxygenation (SpO₂ > 94% on room air or minimal oxygen support).
    *   Improve airway clearance, evidenced by reduced frequency of tracheal suctioning and decreased sputum viscosity.
    *   Improve respiratory muscle strength, targeting an increase in maximum expiratory time by >2 seconds.
    *   Successfully tolerate trials with a one-way speaking valve for at least 30-60 minutes continuously to facilitate phonation and restore glottic sensation.
*   **Swallowing & Nutrition:**
    *   Halt weight loss and achieve nutritional stability, with an upward trend in serum albumin and prealbumin levels.
    *   Improve oropharyngeal muscle strength and coordination through targeted exercises (NPO).
    *   Demonstrate improved laryngeal elevation (>2cm) and initiation of swallow during dry swallow trials.
    *   Maintain meticulous oral hygiene to minimize bacterial load.
*   **Function:**
    *   Improve core and limb strength to tolerate sitting upright in a chair for at least 1 hour, twice daily.
    *   Achieve independence in bed mobility.

#### Long-term goals:
*   **Airway & Respiration:**
    *   Successful decannulation of the tracheostomy.
*   **Swallowing & Nutrition:**
    *   Achieve safe and efficient oral intake of a modified texture diet (at minimum, pureed solids and thickened liquids) to meet 100% of nutritional needs.
    *   Successful removal of the nasogastric tube.
*   **Communication:**
    *   Achieve functional and intelligible speech.
*   **Function:**
    *   Achieve independence in all Activities of Daily Living (ADL).
    *   Reverse sarcopenia, with Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI) and handgrip strength returning to normal ranges.

### 2. Treatment Methods

#### Swallowing Rehabilitation
*   **Status:** Patient is strictly NPO (Nil Per Os) due to severe aspiration risk (PAS 7) and absent cricopharyngeal opening.
*   **Focus:** Intensive motor exercises to rehabilitate swallowing musculature without oral intake.
*   **Exercises (5 days/week):**
    1.  **Cricopharyngeal Opening:**
        *   **Shaker Exercise (Head-Lifting):** To target suprahyoid muscles, facilitate laryngeal elevation, and promote UES opening. Perform 3 sets of 30-second holds followed by 30 consecutive head lifts daily.
    2.  **Laryngeal Elevation & Pharyngeal Contraction:**
        *   **Mendelsohn Maneuver:** Practice with dry swallows to prolong and enhance laryngeal elevation.
        *   **Effortful Swallow:** Practice with saliva to improve pharyngeal clearing.
    3.  **Airway Protection:**
        *   **Supraglottic Swallow:** Practice sequence (hold breath, swallow, cough) without bolus to improve vocal fold closure and airway protection.
        *   **Vocal Adduction Exercises:** Pushing/pulling exercises while phonating "ah" to improve glottic closure.
    4.  **Sensation:**
        *   **Thermal-Tactile Stimulation (TTS):** Stroking the anterior faucial arches with a chilled laryngeal mirror prior to swallow attempts to heighten oral sensation and reduce swallow initiation delay.
*   **Modalities:**
    *   **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES):** Apply to submental (suprahyoid) muscles during swallowing exercises to augment muscle contraction and improve laryngeal elevation.

#### Respiratory Rehabilitation
*   **Secretion Management:**
    *   **Chest Physiotherapy:** Postural drainage, percussion, and vibration to mobilize secretions, performed 3-4 times daily, targeting areas of consolidation seen on chest CT.
    *   **Assisted Cough:** Manual assistance (abdominal thrust/costophrenic assist) coordinated with patient's expiratory effort to improve cough effectiveness.
    *   **Suctioning:** Continue as-needed tracheal suctioning. Utilize subglottic suctioning port prior to cuff deflation to clear pooled secretions.
*   **Breathing Muscle Training:**
    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing:** Tactile cueing to retrain a normal breathing pattern and improve diaphragmatic excursion.
    *   **Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST):** Use a pressure threshold device, starting at a low resistance, to improve expiratory force for coughing and speech.
*   **Tracheostomy Management:**
    *   **Cuff Management:** Maintain cuff pressure between 25-30 kPa, checking every 8 hours. Implement a cuff deflation protocol once secretion load decreases and aspiration risk is managed.
    *   **Speaking Valve Trials:** Initiate trials with a one-way speaking valve (e.g., Passy-Muir Valve) once medically stable. Start with short periods, monitoring SpO₂ and work of breathing. This will improve glottic function, sensation, and communication.

#### Nutritional Management
*   **Route & Formula:** Continue nasogastric tube feeding. Utilize a high-protein, high-calorie enteral formula to address malnutrition and sarcopenia. Target intake: ~2000-2100 kcal/day and ~90-100 g protein/day, adjusted by dietitian.
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   Weekly monitoring of weight, mid-upper arm circumference, and calf circumference.
    *   Repeat serum albumin and prealbumin levels in 2-4 weeks.
    *   Maintain strict intake/output charting.

#### Physical & Occupational Therapy
*   **Focus:** Combat sarcopenia and deconditioning.
*   **Therapy (5 days/week):**
    1.  **Strengthening:** Progressive resistance training for upper and lower extremities, starting with gravity-eliminated positions and advancing as tolerated. Focus on core stability exercises.
    2.  **Endurance:** Gradually increase duration of upright sitting in a chair.
    3.  **Functional Mobility:** Practice bed mobility, transfers (bed to chair), and pre-gait activities.
    4.  **ADL Retraining:** Begin with upper body dressing and grooming activities while seated.

#### Nursing & Patient Education
*   **Oral Hygiene:** Meticulous oral care with a soft brush and antiseptic rinse (e.g., chlorhexidine) at least 4 times daily to reduce bacterial load and risk of aspiration pneumonia.
*   **Positioning:** Maintain head of bed elevation at 30-45 degrees at all times to minimize gastroesophageal reflux.
*   **Education:** Educate patient and family on the purpose of all rehabilitation interventions, signs of respiratory distress, and tracheostomy care basics.
