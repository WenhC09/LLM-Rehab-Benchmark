### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-Term Goals:
*   Stabilize vital signs, correct hypoxemia, and control pulmonary infection.
*   Improve respiratory function, enhance cough strength, effectively clear airway secretions, and prepare for tracheostomy tube decannulation.
*   Improve swallowing function, enhance oropharyngeal sensory and motor abilities, reduce aspiration risk, and prepare for nasogastric tube removal and partial oral feeding.
*   Improve nutritional status, correct malnutrition and sarcopenia.

#### Long-Term Goals:
*   Successful decannulation of tracheostomy tube and removal of nasogastric tube (achieving "dual-tube removal").
*   Restore safe and effective oral feeding ability.
*   Enhance Activities of Daily Living (ADL), achieve self-care, and facilitate return to family and society.

### 2. Therapeutic Methods

#### (1) Swallowing Function Therapy  
*   **Oropharyngeal Sensory Stimulation Training**: Utilize thermal (ice) stimulation, sour taste stimulation, vibratory stimulation, and air-pulse stimulation combined with neuromuscular electrical stimulation to improve pharyngeal sensation, enhance pharyngeal reflex, and promote swallowing initiation.  
*   **Oropharyngeal Motor Function Training**:  
    *   Implement orofacial exercises, simple tongue pressure resistance training, Mendelsohn maneuver, and effortful swallowing to strengthen relevant muscle groups.  
    *   Conduct pharyngeal balloon biofeedback training to increase pharyngeal pressure, improve pharyngeal muscle contraction, and facilitate bolus propulsion.  
    *   Perform phonation training using a Passy-Muir speaking valve to enhance soft palate elevation.  
*   **Cricopharyngeal Muscle Opening Improvement**: Perform catheter balloon dilatation. Technique: Insert balloon transnasally, inflate with 2–5 mL water under fluoroscopic guidance. Frequency: 1 session daily, 6–10 repetitions/session. Post-dilatation nebulization: 10 mL 0.9% sodium chloride + 5 mg dexamethasone.  
*   **Airway Protection Training**: Instruct in supraglottic and super-supraglottic swallowing maneuvers to enhance airway protection during swallowing.  
*   **Precision Neuromodulation Therapy**: Initiate innovative intervention if conventional rehabilitation fails. First, identify bilateral temporal lobe network abnormalities via functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Subsequently, apply high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to target brain regions based on compensatory theory, aiming to remodel brainstem swallowing centers.  

#### (2) Respiratory Function Therapy  
*   **Breathing Pattern & Respiratory Muscle Training**:  
    *   Guide pursed-lip breathing and diaphragmatic breathing to correct abnormal patterns.  
    *   Use inspiratory/expiratory muscle trainers for resistance training to improve diaphragmatic contractility and endurance.  
*   **Cough Training**: Enhance cough efficacy to clear airway and pharyngeal secretions, improving pulmonary ventilation.  
*   **Pre-Decannulation Training**:  
    *   Implement speaking valve application and tracheostomy tube capping to transition from tracheostomy-dependent to oronasal breathing.  
    *   Pre-capping protocol: Suction subglottic secretions, deflate cuff, and progressively extend capping duration per tolerance.  
*   **External Diaphragm Pacing Therapy**: Apply transcutaneous low-frequency electrical stimulation to phrenic nerves to induce rhythmic diaphragmatic contraction/relaxation, increasing diaphragmatic excursion and pulmonary ventilation to alleviate hypoxemia and dyspnea.  

#### (3) Nutritional Therapy  
*   **Target Calorie Calculation**: Determine daily energy requirement (~1837.5 kcal) using formula: `[Actual body weight + 0.25 × (Ideal body weight − Actual body weight)] × 30 kcal`.  
*   **Personalized Dietary Intervention**: Prescribe leucine-rich high-quality protein diet for sarcopenia, delivered via nasogastric tube or intermittent feeding to ensure adequate balanced nutrition.  

#### (4) Rehabilitation Nursing Interventions  
*   **Oral Care**: Perform negative-pressure flushing toothbrushing combined with hospital-formulated (Traditional Chinese Medicine-based) oral rinse to enhance cleanliness and prevent infection.  
*   **Airway Management**: Strengthen tracheostomy suctioning with routine subglottic secretion drainage. Integrate postural drainage and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for efficient secretion clearance.  
*   **Feeding Tube Optimization**: Transition from continuous nasogastric feeding to intermittent methods (pre-decannulation: Intermittent Oro-Gastric tube feeding; post-decannulation: Intermittent Oro-Esophageal tube feeding) to prepare for tube removal. Implement enteral nutrition protocols with aspiration precautions.  
*   **ADL Training & Psychological Support**: Instruct in dressing, toileting, and transfer activities to encourage self-care. Provide psychological counseling via successful rehabilitation case-sharing to build confidence.  

#### (5) Adjunctive Therapies  
*   **Infection & Hypoxemia Control**: Administer sensitivity-directed antibiotics. Correct hypoxemia via supplemental oxygen, respiratory training, and intravenous microinfusion of nikethamide to stimulate respiratory center.  
*   **Pulmonary Toilet**: Perform fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and deep suctioning to control pulmonary infection.  
*   **Complication Management**:  
    *   Acute exacerbation of chronic cholecystitis: Transfer to hepatobiliary surgery for cholecystectomy.  
    *   Pre-decannulation tracheal polyp-induced stenosis: Perform laser thermal ablation by ENT specialist to relieve obstruction.  
*   **Infection Control**: Strictly enforce multidrug-resistant organism isolation protocols.
