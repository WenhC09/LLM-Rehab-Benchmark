## Rehabilitation Treatment Plan  

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals  
**Short-term goals (1-4 weeks):**  
- **Airway Protection**: Reduce aspiration risk (PAS ≤4), achieve effective cough (peak flow ≥160 L/min), manage secretions (Murray Scale ≤1).  
- **Respiratory Stability**: Attain SpO₂ ≥95% on room air, resolve pulmonary infection (normalize ABG: PaO₂ >80 mmHg), reduce ventilator dependence.  
- **Nutritional Improvement**: Increase serum albumin to ≥35 g/L and prealbumin to ≥200 mg/L via enteral nutrition; halt weight loss.  
- **Swallowing Safety**: Enable safe oral intake of honey-thick liquids (Level 3) without penetration (VFSS-confirmed).  

**Long-term goals (3-6 months):**  
- **Functional Independence**: Decannulation (stable airway ≥72h), full oral diet (FOIS ≥5), normal vocal fold closure (FEES-confirmed).  
- **Nutrition/Mobility**: Restore weight to 65kg, increase SMI >8.5 kg/m², achieve independent ADLs (Barthel Index ≥85).  

### 2. Treatment Methods  
#### **Swallowing Rehabilitation**  
- *Sensory-Motor Retraining*:  
  - Thermal-tactile stimulation (iced laryngeal mirror) to trigger swallow initiation.  
  - Mendelsohn maneuver training (manual laryngeal elevation facilitation).  
  - Effortful swallow exercises to reduce vallecular residue.  
- *Pharyngeal Strengthening*:  
  - Shaker exercises (3x/day) to improve UES opening.  
  - Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST 150) to enhance cough efficacy.  
- *Compensatory Strategies*:  
  - Chin tuck with honey-thick liquids only under VFSS monitoring.  
  - Supraglottic swallow during all trials.  

#### **Respiratory Rehabilitation**  
- *Airway Clearance*:  
  - Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) 4x/day + high-frequency chest wall oscillation.  
  - Saline lavage before suctioning (Q4h) for *Klebsiella* management.  
- *Ventilator Weaning Protocol*:  
  - Gradual T-piece trials (starting 30min QID), diaphragmatic pacing via ultrasound biofeedback.  
- *Breathing Training*:  
  - Threshold IMT (50% MIP) + incentive spirometry 10x/hour awake.  
  - Pursed-lip breathing to stabilize respiratory rhythm.  

#### **Nutritional Intervention**  
- *Enteral Nutrition Optimization*:  
  - High-protein formula (1.8g/kg/day) + modular glutamine (30g/day) via NG tube.  
  - Cyclic feeding (18h/day) with head elevation ≥45°.  
- *Oral Supplementation*:  
  - Vitamin D₃ (5000 IU/day) + leucine-enriched whey protein (post-swallowing therapy only).  

#### **Physical Reconditioning**  
- *Sarcopenia Management*:  
  - Progressive resistance training (2lb ankle weights): seated leg extensions 3x15 reps BID.  
  - Functional electrical stimulation (FES) to quadriceps during ambulation.  
- *Mobility Training*:  
  - Supported sit-to-stand transfers 10x/hour; parallel bar gait training 5min TID.  

#### **Adjunctive Therapies**  
- *Tracheostomy Care*:  
  - Cuff pressure maintenance at 20-25 cmH₂O; speaking valve trials (Passy-Muir®) 15min TID.  
- *Oral Hygiene Protocol*:  
  - Chlorhexidine swabs Q6h + manual salivary gland massage.  
- *Communication Training*:  
  - Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD®) for dysarthria.  

> *Precautions*: Strict NPO except during supervised therapy; continuous SpO₂ monitoring; abort oral trials if respiratory rate >25/min.
