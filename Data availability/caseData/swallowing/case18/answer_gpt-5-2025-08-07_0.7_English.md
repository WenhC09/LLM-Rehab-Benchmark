# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (within 2–4 weeks)
1. **Swallowing Function**
   - Reduce aspiration risk by improving airway protection reflexes (cough, throat clearing).
   - Achieve safe swallowing of small volumes of puree consistency under supervision as verified by instrumental assessment.
2. **Respiratory Function**
   - Improve oxygenation (SpO₂ ≥ 95% on room air or minimal O₂ supplementation).
   - Enhance cough effectiveness to clear airway secretions.
   - Reduce sputum volume and viscosity through airway clearance techniques.
3. **Nutrition**
   - Halt weight loss; increase serum albumin to ≥ 32 g/L.
   - Maintain or improve muscle mass through adequate nutritional support.
4. **Motor and ADL**
   - Maintain independent sitting balance and partial self-care in ADL.
5. **Tracheostomy Management**
   - Maintain unobstructed airway and prevent infection; begin evaluation for cuff deflation tolerance.

### Long-term Goals (within 3–6 months)
1. **Swallowing Function**
   - Achieve functional oral intake of regular or modified diet without aspiration.
   - Remove nasogastric tube when adequate oral nutrition is possible.
2. **Respiratory Function**
   - Achieve decannulation of tracheostomy after safe airway and swallowing function are confirmed.
   - Maintain normal breathing pattern and endurance for daily activities.
3. **Nutrition**
   - Restore weight to ≥ 65 kg and SMI to ≥ 8.5 kg/m².
4. **Motor and ADL**
   - Achieve independence in ADL and community mobility.
5. **Speech**
   - Restore intelligible speech for daily communication.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### 2.1 Swallowing Dysfunction Rehabilitation
- **Direct Therapy**
  - Begin with indirect swallowing training: effortful swallow, Mendelsohn maneuver, Shaker exercise / chin tuck against resistance (CTAR) to improve suprahyoid and pharyngeal muscle strength.
  - Thermal-tactile stimulation to trigger swallow reflex (ice stick stimulation to faucial pillars).
  - Oral motor and sensory stimulation.
- **Compensatory Strategies**
  - Maintain NPO for unsafe consistencies; allow only therapist-supervised trials of small-volume, high-viscosity bolus if instrumental assessment confirms safety.
  - Upright sitting position (≥ 45°) during and after feeding.
- **Adjunctive Modalities**
  - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to suprahyoid muscles if no contraindication.
- **Monitoring**
  - Repeat VFSS or FEES to guide dietary progression.

### 2.2 Respiratory Function Training
- **Airway Clearance**
  - Regular suctioning with aseptic technique; subglottic suction before cuff deflation.
  - Chest physiotherapy: percussion, vibration, postural drainage.
  - Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation device if cough remains ineffective.
- **Breathing Exercises**
  - Diaphragmatic breathing and segmental breathing exercises.
  - Incentive spirometry to improve lung expansion.
- **Cuff Management**
  - Gradual cuff deflation trials with close monitoring of oxygenation, secretion control, and aspiration risk.
- **Infection Control**
  - Continue physician-directed antimicrobial therapy for *Klebsiella pneumoniae*; maintain oral hygiene.

### 2.3 Nutritional Support
- **Enteral Nutrition**
  - Continue nasogastric feeding with high-protein, high-calorie formula.
  - Adjust feeding regimen to achieve 30–35 kcal/kg/day and 1.2–1.5 g protein/kg/day.
- **Micronutrient Supplementation**
  - Supplement vitamins and trace elements per deficiency risk.
- **Dietary Progression**
  - Transition to partial oral intake when swallowing improves; maintain adequate caloric intake during transition.

### 2.4 Speech Rehabilitation
- **Voice Therapy**
  - Vocal fold adduction exercises to improve glottic closure.
  - Use of speaking valve trials during cuff deflation if tolerated.
- **Articulation Training**
  - Oral motor strengthening and speech drills for clarity.

### 2.5 Motor and ADL Training
- **Strength Training**
  - Progressive resistance training for major muscle groups to counter sarcopenia.
- **Endurance Training**
  - Low-intensity aerobic exercise as tolerated.
- **ADL Practice**
  - Task-specific training for feeding, dressing, and grooming.

### 2.6 Tracheostomy Management
- Daily stoma care and inspection for infection or granulation tissue.
- Humidification of inspired air to prevent secretion thickening.
- Monitor for airway stenosis; coordinate with ENT for tracheal polyp management.

### 2.7 Nursing and Oral Care
- Twice-daily oral hygiene with antiseptic rinse.
- Regular oral cavity assessment to prevent aspiration pneumonia.

### 2.8 Psychological Support
- Counseling to address anxiety, depression, or communication frustration.
- Family education on care techniques and rehabilitation participation.
