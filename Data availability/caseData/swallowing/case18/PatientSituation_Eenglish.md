## Case Information

### I. Medical History Summary

*   **Demographics**: Male, 43 years old, Derung ethnicity, from Nujiang Prefecture, Yunnan Province.  
*   **Chief Complaint**: Dysphagia, dysarthria, and status post tracheostomy for over 20 days.  
*   **Present Illness**: On the evening of November 25, 2021, the patient suddenly developed dysphagia and dysarthria without vomiting, limb movement impairment, incontinence, or loss of consciousness. He was admitted to a local People’s Hospital, where MRI indicated medullary infarction. On November 26, 2021, due to excessive sputum and weak respiratory effort, he underwent "tracheostomy" with ventilator-assisted ventilation. After stabilization, he was transferred to our department for further rehabilitation on December 18, 2021. Post-onset, he has been fed via nasogastric tube, maintained a tracheostomy, produced copious white sticky sputum, and experienced a 6kg weight loss in one month.  
*   **Past Medical History**: Prior "intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage" (details unknown) without residual dysfunction. History of "chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis" for 6 years.  
*   **Clinical Diagnoses**:  
    1.  Medullary infarction, recovery phase  
    2.  Hypoxemia  
    3.  Pulmonary infection  
    4.  Status post tracheostomy  
    5.  Malnutrition  
    6.  Sarcopenia  
    7.  Chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis  
*   **Functional Diagnoses**:  
    1.  Swallowing dysfunction  
    2.  Speech dysfunction  
    3.  Motor dysfunction  
    4.  Partial dependence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  

### II. Pre-Rehabilitation Functional Assessment  

#### 1. Swallowing Function Assessment  

*   **Clinical Assessment (December 18, 2021)**  
    *   **Laryngeal Function**: Laryngeal elevation <2cm; maximum phonation time 5.92 seconds; hoarse voice, abnormally high pitch, abnormal volume. Weak voluntary cough and throat-clearing. Abnormal cervical auscultation: prolonged/weak swallowing sounds, repeated swallows.  
    *   **Orofacial Function**: Normal.  
    *   **Reflexes**: Absent gag reflex and vomiting reflex; diminished cough reflex.  
    *   **Repetitive Saliva Swallowing Test (RSST)**: 1 swallow/30 seconds; swallow amplitude <2cm.  
    *   **Kubota Water Swallow Test**: Grade 5.  
    *   **Volume-Viscosity Swallow Test (V-VST)**: Coughing and voice change with 3mL moderately thick food, indicating impaired swallowing safety and efficacy.  

*   **Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) (December 22, 2021)**  
    *   Tested with 3~5mL each of: #2 (nectar-thick liquid), #3 (puree), #1 (thin liquid).  
    *   **Findings**: Adequate lip closure; oral transit preserved; delayed swallowing initiation; insufficient laryngeal elevation. Partial oral residue. Significant residue in valleculae and pyriform sinuses persisting after multiple swallows. Trace aspiration with 5mL #1 (thin liquid); diminished cough reflex. Complete failure of cricopharyngeal opening.  
    *   *(Attached: Early VFSS video)*  

*   **Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) (December 22, 2021)**  
    *   **Findings**: Delayed swallowing initiation; incomplete bilateral vocal fold closure; hoarseness; impaired laryngeal sensation.  
    *   **Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale**: Grade 5 residue bilaterally in pyriform sinuses and valleculae with 3~5mL #2 (moderately thick) food.  
    *   **Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS)**: Level 7.  
    *   **Murray Secretion Scale**: Grade 2.  
    *   *(Attached: Early FEES video)*  

#### 2. Respiratory Function Assessment  

*   **Clinical Assessment (December 18, 2021)**  
    *   **Breathing Pattern**: Thoracoabdominal breathing; respiratory rate 21/min; abnormal rhythm (alternating deep/slow and shallow/rapid).  
    *   **Maximum Expiratory Time**: 5.06 seconds.  
    *   **Sputum**: Copious yellow type II sputum (moderately thick).  
    *   **Vital Signs**: SpO₂ 84%~95%; cyanosis of lips/fingertips; bilateral lung crackles.  

*   **Laboratory Tests**  
    *   **Sputum Culture**: *Klebsiella pneumoniae*.  
    *   **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)**: PaO₂ 65.4 mmHg, PaCO₂ 37.2 mmHg.  

*   **Instrumental Tests**  
    *   **Chest CT**: Bilateral multifocal pneumonia.  
    *   **Neck CT (December 18, 2021)**: Status post tracheostomy; no peristomal granulation tissue.  
    *   **Neck CT (February 5, 2022)**: Tracheal polyp; airway stenosis.  
    *   **Diaphragmatic Ultrasound**: Diaphragm thickness: right 2.3mm, left 2.3mm; excursion: 8.1mm (quiet breathing), 21.6mm (forced breathing).  
    *   **Bronchoscopy**: Copious yellow sputum in bilateral bronchi.  

#### 3. Nutritional Assessment  

*   **Clinical Assessment (December 18, 2021)**  
    *   **Weight**: 59kg (6kg loss in 1 month).  
    *   **Blood Biochemistry**: Albumin 29.8 g/L; Prealbumin 109 mg/L.  
    *   **Anthropometry**: Mid-arm circumference 21.5cm; Calf circumference 30cm.  
    *   **Body Composition Analysis**: Skeletal muscle mass 23.3kg; Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI) 7.8 kg/m².  
    *   **Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS-2002)**: Score 5 (nutritional risk present).  
    *   **Handgrip Strength**: Left 15.5kg, Right 18.4kg.  

#### 4. Nursing Assessment  

*   **Clinical Assessment (December 18, 2021)**  
    *   **Dye Test**: Positive.  
    *   **Oral Hygiene Assessment**: Score 18 (oral hygiene deficit present).  
    *   **Tracheostomy Management**: Cannula size 7.5mm; cuff pressure 25~30 kPa; 3~6mL secretions suctioned from subglottic space.
