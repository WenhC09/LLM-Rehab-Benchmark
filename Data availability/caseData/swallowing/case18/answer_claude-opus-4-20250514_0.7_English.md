 ## Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals:

**Short-term goals (2-4 weeks):**
- Improve respiratory function and achieve SpOâ‚‚ >95% on room air
- Reduce sputum volume and improve secretion management
- Establish safe swallowing for modified consistency foods (IDDSI Level 4-5)
- Improve nutritional status with weight gain of 1-2kg
- Enhance cough effectiveness and airway protection
- Achieve partial phonation with cuff deflation trials

**Long-term goals (8-12 weeks):**
- Progress to oral intake of regular diet with minimal modifications
- Achieve tracheostomy decannulation
- Restore functional communication and voice quality
- Return to independent ADLs
- Achieve weight restoration to baseline (65kg)
- Improve skeletal muscle mass and strength

### 2. Treatment Methods:

**A. Respiratory Rehabilitation:**
- Chest physiotherapy 3x daily including percussion, vibration, and postural drainage
- Incentive spirometry every 2 hours while awake
- Diaphragmatic breathing exercises 4x daily
- Cough training with manual assist techniques
- Progressive ventilator weaning protocol with cuff deflation trials
- Nebulization therapy as prescribed
- Suctioning protocol with sterile technique

**B. Dysphagia Management:**
- NPO status maintained initially with nasogastric feeding
- Oral motor exercises: tongue strengthening, range of motion, resistance training 3x daily
- Thermal-tactile stimulation to improve swallow trigger
- Mendelsohn maneuver training for laryngeal elevation
- Shaker exercise protocol: 3x60 second holds, 3x daily
- Effortful swallow training
- Progressive diet trials starting with IDDSI Level 4 (pureed) under supervision
- Compensatory strategies: chin tuck, head turn, multiple swallows

**C. Communication Therapy:**
- Voice rest initially with alternative communication methods
- Progressive cuff deflation trials with speaking valve when appropriate
- Vocal hygiene education
- Voice therapy focusing on breath support and coordination
- Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT) principles when phonation established

**D. Nutritional Support:**
- High-protein, high-calorie enteral nutrition via nasogastric tube (30-35 kcal/kg/day)
- Protein supplementation targeting 1.5g/kg/day
- Monitor albumin and prealbumin weekly
- Transition to oral feeding as swallow function improves
- Texture modification per VFSS/FEES results

**E. Physical Rehabilitation:**
- Progressive resistance training for major muscle groups
- Aerobic conditioning starting with bedside exercises
- Balance and coordination training
- Functional mobility training
- ADL retraining with energy conservation techniques

**F. Medical Management:**
- Continue antibiotic therapy for pneumonia
- Tracheostomy care with regular inner cannula changes
- Monitor for granulation tissue development
- Regular suctioning with strict aseptic technique
- Cuff pressure monitoring 2x daily

**G. Multidisciplinary Approach:**
- Weekly team meetings to coordinate care
- Speech-language pathology 5x weekly
- Physical therapy 5x weekly
- Occupational therapy 3x weekly
- Respiratory therapy daily
- Nutritionist consultation weekly
- ENT follow-up for airway assessment
- Psychology consultation for adjustment support

**H. Monitoring and Reassessment:**
- Weekly FEES or clinical swallow evaluation
- Repeat VFSS at 4 weeks
- Daily respiratory status monitoring
- Weekly nutritional parameters
- Bronchoscopy as indicated for airway clearance
- Regular cuff leak tests for decannulation readiness
