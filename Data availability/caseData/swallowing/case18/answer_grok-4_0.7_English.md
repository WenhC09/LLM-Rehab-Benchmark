# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks):
- Improve swallowing safety and efficacy to allow safe oral intake of nectar-thick liquids and pureed foods without aspiration.
- Enhance respiratory function to achieve SpO₂ ≥95% on room air and reduce sputum production.
- Increase nutritional intake to stabilize weight and improve albumin levels to ≥35 g/L.
- Improve oral hygiene to achieve an Oral Hygiene Assessment score ≤12.
- Enhance speech intelligibility to produce short phrases with improved phonation and reduced hoarseness.
- Maintain tracheostomy patency and reduce secretion accumulation to ≤3mL per suctioning session.

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
- Achieve safe and effective swallowing for a regular diet with minimal restrictions, enabling nasogastric tube removal.
- Attain independent respiratory function, allowing tracheostomy decannulation.
- Restore pre-illness weight (65 kg) and improve skeletal muscle mass to SMI ≥8.5 kg/m².
- Achieve full independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) with no assistance required.
- Regain clear and functional speech for effective communication in daily interactions.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Swallowing Rehabilitation
- **Swallowing Therapy (Daily, 30–45 min sessions):**
  - **Effortful Swallowing**: Practice 10–15 repetitions, 3 sets daily to strengthen pharyngeal muscles and improve laryngeal elevation.
  - **Mendelsohn Maneuver**: Perform 10 repetitions, 3 sets daily to enhance cricopharyngeal opening and reduce pharyngeal residue.
  - **Supraglottic Swallow**: Train to hold breath before and during swallowing to protect airway, 10–15 repetitions, 3 sets daily.
  - **Shaker Exercise**: Perform 3 sets of 1-minute sustained head lifts and 30 head lifts daily to strengthen suprahyoid muscles.
  - **Compensatory Strategies**: Use chin-tuck posture during swallowing trials to minimize aspiration risk.
- **Diet Modification**:
  - Continue nasogastric tube feeding (1500–1800 kcal/day, high-protein formula, 1.5 g/kg protein).
  - Initiate oral feeding trials under supervision with 3–5 mL nectar-thick liquids (#2) and pureed foods (#3), 2–3 times daily, progressing volume and consistency as tolerated (guided by repeat VFSS/FEES in 4 weeks).
- **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**:
  - Apply to suprahyoid and laryngeal muscles, 30 min/day, 5 days/week to improve swallowing coordination and strength.

### Respiratory Rehabilitation
- **Respiratory Muscle Training (Daily, 20–30 min sessions):**
  - **Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT)**: Use threshold device at 30–50% of maximum inspiratory pressure, 15–20 min/day to improve diaphragm strength.
  - **Expiratory Muscle Training (EMT)**: Practice forceful exhalation against resistance, 10 repetitions, 3 sets daily to enhance cough strength.
  - **Diaphragmatic Breathing**: Perform 10–15 min/day to improve thoracoabdominal breathing pattern and respiratory rhythm.
- **Airway Clearance Techniques**:
  - **Postural Drainage**: Perform 15 min, 2–3 times/day in Trendelenburg position to mobilize sputum.
  - **Percussion and Vibration**: Apply to chest bilaterally, 10 min, 2–3 times/day to loosen secretions.
  - **Suctioning**: Regular tracheostomy suctioning (every 4–6 hours or as needed) to manage copious yellow sputum.
- **Oxygen Therapy**:
  - Administer low-flow oxygen (2–4 L/min) via tracheostomy collar to maintain SpO₂ ≥95%, titrate as per ABG results.
- **Antibiotic Therapy**:
  - Continue targeted antibiotics for *Klebsiella pneumoniae* pulmonary infection as per sputum culture, guided by infectious disease consultation.

### Nutritional Rehabilitation
- **Nutritional Support**:
  - Provide enteral nutrition via nasogastric tube (1800–2000 kcal/day, 1.5–2.0 g/kg protein) to address malnutrition and sarcopenia.
  - Supplement with oral nutritional supplements (high-protein, high-calorie) during oral feeding trials.
  - Monitor weight weekly and blood biochemistry (albumin, prealbumin) biweekly to assess nutritional progress.
- **Dietitian Consultation**:
  - Weekly consultation to adjust caloric and protein intake based on weight gain and muscle mass improvement (target SMI ≥8.5 kg/m²).

### Tracheostomy and Oral Hygiene Management
- **Tracheostomy Care**:
  - Daily cleaning and dressing changes to prevent infection and maintain skin integrity.
  - Monitor cuff pressure (maintain 20–25 cmH₂O) to prevent tracheal damage.
  - Weekly speech-language pathologist (SLP) evaluation for tracheostomy weaning readiness (e.g., speaking valve trials).
- **Oral Hygiene Program**:
  - Brush teeth and oral mucosa twice daily with soft toothbrush and antiseptic mouthwash (chlorhexidine 0.12%).
  - Perform oral care every 4 hours to reduce bacterial load and improve Oral Hygiene Assessment score.

### Speech Rehabilitation
- **Speech Therapy (Daily, 30 min sessions):**
  - **Vocal Exercises**: Practice sustained vowel phonation (5–10 seconds, 10 repetitions, 3 sets) to improve vocal fold closure and reduce hoarseness.
  - **Pitch and Volume Training**: Use visual feedback (e.g., spectrogram) to normalize pitch and increase volume, 10–15 min/day.
  - **Articulation Exercises**: Practice simple syllables and short phrases to improve dysarthria, progressing to sentence-level speech.
- **Speaking Valve Trials**:
  - Initiate Passy-Muir valve use under SLP supervision, 5–10 min/day, increasing duration as tolerated to enhance phonation.

### Physical Rehabilitation
- **Strength and Mobility Training (Daily, 30–45 min sessions):**
  - **Upper Limb Strengthening**: Use resistance bands for biceps, triceps, and shoulder exercises, 10 repetitions, 3 sets to improve handgrip strength (target >25 kg bilaterally).
  - **Lower Limb Exercises**: Perform seated leg presses and knee extensions, 10 repetitions, 3 sets to address sarcopenia.
  - **Bedside Mobility**: Progress from bed-to-chair transfers to assisted standing (5–10 min/day) to enhance ADL independence.
- **Physical Therapy for Motor Dysfunction**:
  - Passive of motion (ROM) exercises for all major joints, 10–15 min/day to prevent contractures.
  - Active-assisted exercises for upper and lower limbs, progressing to active movements as strength improves.

### Monitoring and Follow-Up
- **Weekly Assessments**:
  - Monitor swallowing function (clinical assessment, RSST, Kubota test).
  - Evaluate respiratory status (SpO₂, respiratory rate, sputum volume).
  - Track nutritional markers (weight, albumin, prealbumin).
  - Assess tracheostomy site and secretion volume.
- **Instrumental Re-evaluations**:
  - Repeat VFSS/FEES at 4 weeks to assess swallowing progress and guide diet advancement.
  - Repeat chest CT and bronchoscopy at 4–6 weeks to evaluate pulmonary infection resolution and tracheal polyp status.
- **Multidisciplinary Team Meetings**:
  - Weekly meetings with physiatrist, SLP, respiratory therapist, dietitian, andtargets**: 
    - **Physiatrist**: Oversees the overall rehabilitation plan, coordinates multidisciplinary interventions, and monitors progress.
    - **Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP)**: Leads swallowing and speech therapy, conducts VFSS/FEES, and guides tracheostomy weaning.
    - **Respiratory Therapist**: Manages airway clearance, oxygen therapy, and respiratory muscle training.
    - **Dietitian**: Adjusts nutritional plan to address malnutrition and sarcopenia.
    - **Physical Therapist**: Implements strength and mobility exercises to improve motor function and ADL independence.
    - **Nurse**: Provides tracheostomy care, oral hygiene, and monitors clinical status.

This plan is tailored to the patient’s current condition as of December 18, 2021, and will be adjusted based on ongoing assessments and progress toward rehabilitation goals.
