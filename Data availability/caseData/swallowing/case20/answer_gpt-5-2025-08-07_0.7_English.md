# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 4 weeks)
1. **Swallowing function**: Improve oral motor control and laryngeal elevation; reduce aspiration risk to enable safe initiation of limited oral trials under supervision.
2. **Respiratory function**: Enhance cough strength and secretion clearance; maintain stable oxygenation with reduced supplemental O₂ requirements.
3. **Motor function**: Increase right upper limb muscle strength from Grade 3 to Grade 3+–4, right lower limb from Grade 3+ to Grade 4; improve sitting and standing balance to reduce fall risk.
4. **Communication**: Improve articulation clarity and phonation via speaking valve trials to facilitate basic communication.
5. **Nutrition**: Prevent further weight loss; aim for weight gain of at least 1–2 kg through optimized enteral feeding.
6. **ADL independence**: Reduce assistance required in basic self-care tasks (feeding, grooming) by at least one functional level.

### Long-term goals (3–6 months)
1. Achieve functional oral intake sufficient to remove nasogastric tube; maintain adequate nutrition orally without aspiration pneumonia.
2. Decannulate tracheostomy safely with stable airway and effective cough.
3. Restore right-side limb strength to ≥Grade 4+, enabling independent ambulation with or without assistive device.
4. Achieve intelligible speech sufficient for daily communication.
5. Regain independence in most ADLs, requiring minimal or no assistance.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Swallowing Function Rehabilitation
- **Oral motor exercises**: Target lips, tongue, and soft palate (e.g., tongue protrusion/retraction, lateralization, resistance exercises).
- **Facial muscle stimulation**: Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to right facial muscles if no contraindications, to improve symmetry and bolus control.
- **Laryngeal elevation training**: Mendelsohn maneuver, effortful swallow, and Shaker/CTAR exercises adapted to tolerance.
- **Thermal-tactile stimulation**: Cold laryngeal mirror or iced swab to faucial pillars to facilitate swallow reflex.
- **Compensatory strategies**: Chin-tuck posture, small-volume boluses, thickened liquids during supervised trials.
- **Swallowing trials**: Begin with controlled, therapist-supervised minimal-volume thickened liquids; progress per VFSS/FEES findings.
- **Secretion management**: Regular oral suctioning, management of sialorrhea with positioning and oral care.

### B. Respiratory Function Training
- **Airway clearance techniques**: Assisted cough, manually assisted expiratory thrust, mechanical insufflation–exsufflation as indicated.
- **Breathing exercises**: Diaphragmatic breathing, inspiratory muscle training with threshold devices to improve tidal volume and chest excursion.
- **Speaking valve trials**: Initiate with short-duration PMV (Passy-Muir Valve) use to improve phonation and subglottic pressure, under close monitoring.
- **Gradual oxygen weaning**: Coordinate with respiratory therapy based on SpO₂ and Borg/mMRC scores.
- **Sputum management**: Humidification, nebulization, and postural drainage.

### C. Motor Function Rehabilitation
- **Therapeutic exercise**: Task-specific training for right upper and lower limbs, including active-assisted to resistive exercises.
- **Balance training**: Static and dynamic balance tasks in sitting and standing; use of parallel bars or therapist assistance.
- **Gait training**: Begin with supportive devices (walker) when right lower limb strength and balance allow.
- **Coordination exercises**: Frenkel exercises for cerebellar coordination deficits; proprioceptive training.

### D. Speech and Communication Therapy
- **Articulation training**: Focus on labial, lingual, and palatal consonants.
- **Respiratory-phonatory coordination**: Exercises to coordinate breath support for speech, especially with speaking valve.
- **Augmentative communication**: Use of communication boards or writing during tracheostomy periods without valve.

### E. Nutritional Support
- **Enteral nutrition optimization**: Adjust caloric and protein intake to meet calculated needs for rehabilitation and healing.
- **Dietitian involvement**: Monitor weight weekly, adjust feeding regimen to promote gradual weight gain.
- **Oral intake trials**: Progress per swallowing safety; coordinate with SLP and nutritionist.

### F. Nursing Care & Education
- **Tracheostomy care**: Daily stoma cleaning, monitoring for granuloma recurrence, suctioning protocols.
- **Oral hygiene**: Frequent oral care to reduce bacterial load and aspiration risk.
- **Skin care & positioning**: Prevention of pressure injuries, proper limb positioning to reduce contracture risk.
- **Caregiver training**: Instruction in home suctioning, tube feeding, safe transfers.

### G. Medical Management Support
- **ENT follow-up**: Monitor laryngeal edema and sinusitis; manage allergic rhinitis/polyp.
- **Pulmonology follow-up**: Reassess airway patency post-granuloma resection.
- **Neurology/neurosurgery follow-up**: Monitor for late postoperative or vascular complications.
