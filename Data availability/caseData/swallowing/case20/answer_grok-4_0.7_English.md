# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks):
- Improve swallowing function to achieve safe oral intake of modified textures (IDDSI Level 4–5) with no aspiration on VFSS.
- Enhance respiratory function to reduce oxygen dependency and improve cough strength (SCSS Score ≥3).
- Increase right limb muscle strength to Grade 4 and improve coordination for basic functional tasks.
- Reduce sialorrhea and improve oral hygiene to minimize aspiration risk.
- Achieve partial independence in basic activities of daily living (ADLs) with minimal assistance.
- Optimize nutritional status to stabilize weight (target BMI ≥18.5).

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
- Achieve safe and efficient oral feeding (IDDSI Level 6–7) with no nasogastric tube dependency.
- Facilitate tracheostomy decannulation by improving airway patency and respiratory muscle strength.
- Restore right limb function to Grade 4+ and improve coordination for complex ADLs.
- Achieve clear, functional speech or effective alternative communication.
- Attain full independence in ADLs with adaptive strategies or minimal equipment.
- Maintain stable weight and resolve malnutrition (BMI ≥19).

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Swallowing Rehabilitation
- **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**: Apply NMES to suprahyoid and laryngeal muscles, 30 min/session, 5 sessions/week for 4 weeks, targeting improved laryngeal elevation and swallow initiation (based on VFSS findings of delayed swallow and weak laryngeal elevation).
- **Effortful Swallowing Training**: 10–15 repetitions/session, 3 sessions/day, 5 days/week, to enhance pharyngeal clearance and reduce residue (Yale Scale Grade 1).
- **Mendelsohn Maneuver**: 10 repetitions/session, 3 sessions/day, 5 days/week, to improve laryngeal elevation and coordination (laryngeal elevation <1cm noted).
- **Thermal-Tactile Stimulation**: Apply cold stimulation to anterior faucial pillars, 10 trials/session, 3 sessions/day, to enhance pharyngeal reflex and swallow initiation.
- **Diet Modification**: Continue nasogastric tube feeding with gradual introduction of IDDSI Level 4 (pureed) foods under supervision, 3–5 mL boluses, 2–3 times/day, based on VFSS results (PAS Score 2, minimal residue). Monitor for aspiration via dye testing weekly.
- **Oral Hygiene Protocol**: Implement rigorous oral care (brushing, suctioning) 3 times/day to reduce sialorrhea and aspiration risk due to copious secretions.

### Respiratory Rehabilitation
- **Respiratory Muscle Training (RMT)**: Use threshold inspiratory muscle trainer, 10–15 min/session, 2 sessions/day, 5 days/week, targeting improved inspiratory muscle strength and thoracic excursion (<1.5cm currently).
- **Cough Training**: Assisted cough techniques (manual abdominal compression), 10 repetitions/session, 3 sessions/day, to enhance cough strength (SCSS Score 2).
- **Sputum Clearance Techniques**: Active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) combined with postural drainage, 15 min/session, 2 sessions/day, to manage profuse sputum and reduce moist rales.
- **Oxygen Therapy Management**: Gradual weaning from high-flow oxygen under pulmonologist guidance, monitoring SpO2 (>92%) and dyspnea (target Borg Scale ≤2 on exertion).
- **Tracheostomy Care**: Daily stoma cleaning and suctioning to maintain patency, with weekly speech-language pathologist (SLP) evaluation for decannulation readiness (post-cryoablation of tracheal granuloma).

### Motor and Functional Rehabilitation
- **Physical Therapy (PT)**:
  - **Strength Training**: Progressive resistance exercises for right upper and lower limbs (Grade 3/3+), focusing on elbow flexors, knee extensors, and hip flexors, 10–12 reps, 3 sets, 5 days/week, using light weights (0.5–1 kg) or resistance bands.
  - **Coordination Training**: Task-specific exercises (e.g., reaching, grasping), 15 min/session, 5 days/week, to address dyskinesia and improve functional use.
  - **Gait Training**: Assisted ambulation with walker, 10–15 min/session, 5 days/week, focusing on weight-bearing and balance to address gait instability and positive Babinski sign.
- **Occupational Therapy (OT)**:
  - Task-oriented training for ADLs (e.g., dressing, feeding), 30 min/session, 5 days/week, with adaptive equipment (e.g., built-up utensils) to compensate for right limb weakness and facial paralysis.
  - Fine motor exercises (e.g., pegboard, buttoning), 15 min/session, to improve right hand dexterity.
- **Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT)**: Restrict left upper limb use for 2 hours/day, encouraging right limb use in functional tasks to address hemiplegia, starting week 2 if tolerated.

### Speech and Communication Rehabilitation
- **Speech Therapy**: Postpone oral speech training until tracheostomy decannulation. Use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices (e.g., picture boards, text-to-speech apps) to facilitate communication, 30 min/session, 5 days/week.
- **Facial Muscle Training**: Facial massage and passive range-of-motion exercises for right-sided facial paralysis, 10 min/session, 3 sessions/day, to improve symmetry and reduce drooling.
- **Articulation Exercises**: Initiate lip and tongue strengthening (e.g., puckering, tongue protrusion), 10 reps/session, 3 sessions/day, to address dysarthria and tongue atrophy.

### Nutritional Management
- **Dietary Plan**: Continue enteral feeding via nasogastric tube (1200–1500 kcal/day, high-protein formula) to address moderate malnutrition risk (NRS-2002 Score 4). Transition to oral intake as swallowing improves, targeting 1800 kcal/day.
- **Nutritional Monitoring**: Weekly weight checks and biweekly NRS-2002 reassessment to track BMI progress (current 17.3, target ≥18.5).
- **Supplements**: Multivitamin and zinc supplementation to support tissue healing and immune function, per dietitian recommendation.

### Psychosocial Support
- **Psychological Counseling**: Weekly 30-minute sessions to address emotional adjustment to functional limitations and tracheostomy dependency.
- **Family Education**: Train caregivers on tracheostomy care, safe feeding techniques, and ADL assistance, 1-hour session/week for 4 weeks.

### Monitoring and Follow-Up
- **Weekly Assessments**:
  - SLP to monitor swallowing progress via RSST and dye tests.
  - PT/OT to evaluate muscle strength (MRC scale) and ADL independence (Barthel Index).
  - Pulmonologist to assess respiratory function and decannulation readiness.
- **Re-evaluate VFSS**: At 4 weeks to assess aspiration risk and adjust diet.
- **Interdisciplinary Team Meetings**: Biweekly to coordinate care and adjust plan based on progress.
