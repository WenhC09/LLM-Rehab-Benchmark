# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (4-8 weeks):
- **Swallowing**: Achieve safe oral intake of pureed foods and honey-thick liquids without aspiration; reduce tracheal secretions; improve laryngeal elevation (>1.5cm)
- **Respiratory**: Increase peak cough flow by 30%; tolerate tracheostomy cuff deflation for >4 hours/day; reduce mMRC dyspnea to grade 1
- **Motor**: Improve right limb strength to grade 4- (upper) and 4 (lower); achieve independent sitting balance for 3 minutes
- **Nutrition**: Increase weight by 1.5kg; transition to partial oral nutrition with supplemental tube feeding
- **Speech**: Produce intelligible single words with Passy-Muir valve
- **Airway**: Prepare for tracheostomy decannulation through granuloma management

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- **Swallowing**: Achieve full oral diet with thin liquids (Penetration-Aspiration Scale ≤1); eliminate nasogastric tube
- **Respiratory**: Successful tracheostomy decannulation; independent secretion management
- **Motor**: Ambulate 15m with single-point cane; achieve modified independence in ADLs
- **Nutrition**: Maintain BMI >18.5 with oral intake only
- **Speech**: Produce simple sentences with 80% intelligibility

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Dysphagia Management
1. **Compensatory Strategies**:
   - Diet modification: Honey-thick liquids + pureed foods (Nectar/Spoon-thick IDDSI levels)
   - Chin-tuck posture during swallowing
   - Double swallow technique after each bolus
2. **Direct Swallowing Therapy**:
   - Thermal-tactile stimulation before meals
   - Mendelsohn maneuver training (surface EMG biofeedback)
   - Effortful swallow exercises 3x/day
3. **Oral Motor Exercises**:
   - Tongue resistance training with depressor
   - Lip seal exercises (holding spatula)
   - Masako maneuver 10 reps/3x daily
4. **Airway Protection**:
   - Tracheostomy cuff deflation during swallowing
   - Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) pre/post meals
   - Secretion management protocol: Q2hr oral suctioning

### B. Respiratory Rehabilitation
1. **Breathing Retraining**:
   - Diaphragmatic breathing with visual feedback
   - Threshold IMT (starting at 30% MIP) 2x10 reps/day
2. **Cough Enhancement**:
   - Assisted cough technique (abdominal compression)
   - Lung volume recruitment maneuvers
3. **Tracheostomy Management**:
   - Progressive downsizing (transition to fenestrated tube)
   - Passy-Muir valve trials (starting 15min TID)
   - Weekly bronchoscopy monitoring for granuloma recurrence
4. **Pulmonary Hygiene**:
   - Postural drainage with percussion (modified for right hemiparesis)
   - Active cycle of breathing technique QID

### C. Motor Rehabilitation
1. **Strength Training**:
   - Right UE: Shoulder stabilization (PNF D2 flexion), wrist extension with 0.5kg weight
   - Right LE: Sit-to-stand transfers (height-adjusted chair), ankle dorsiflexion resistance bands
   - Frequency: 3 sets×10 reps BID
2. **Balance Training**:
   - Sitting balance: Weight shifting on therapy ball
   - Standing: Parallel bar exercises with <25% support
3. **Functional Mobility**:
   - Bed mobility training (bridging, rolling)
   - Pre-gait activities: Weight shifting in standing
4. **Neuromuscular Re-education**:
   - Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) for right UE
   - FES to right tibialis anterior during gait preparation

### D. Speech and Communication
1. **Phonatory Training**:
   - Digital occlusion technique with Passy-Muir valve
   - Sustained vowel production (5-sec hold)
2. **Articulation Therapy**:
   - Labial exercises: /p/, /b/ syllable drills
   - Lingual exercises: /t/, /d/ repetition
3. **Augmentative Communication**:
   - Picture communication board for immediate needs
   - Voice amplifier trial

### E. Nutritional Support
1. **Oral Intake Protocol**:
   - Supervised meals (30min TID) with pulse oximetry
   - Calorie-dense supplements (1.5kcal/mL)
2. **Tube Feeding Adjustment**:
   - Nighttime cyclic feeding (18-06h)
   - Progressive daytime reduction as oral intake improves
3. **Monitoring**:
   - Weekly weight tracking
   - Prealbumin levels biweekly

### F. Nursing and ADL Management
1. **Tracheostomy Care**:
   - Daily stoma care protocol
   - Humidification system maintenance
2. **Oral Hygiene**:
   - Q2hr tooth/gum cleaning with suction toothbrush
   - pH-neutral oral moisturizer
3. **ADL Training**:
   - Adaptive feeding techniques (rocker-bottom utensils)
   - One-handed dressing strategies

### G. Safety Precautions
- Continuous SpO2 monitoring during therapy
- Aspiration response kit at bedside
- Fall prevention: Bed alarm + non-slip footwear
- Rigorous hand hygiene protocol

### H. Reassessment Schedule
- Biweekly FEES/VFSS (swallowing)
- Weekly cough peak flow measurement
- Fortnightly bronchoscopy (granuloma)
- Monthly Berg Balance Scale assessment
