## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Swallowing Rehabilitation

1.  **NPO Status**: Maintain strict NPO (Nil Per Os) for all nutrition and hydration. Nutrition to be provided exclusively via nasogastric tube.
2.  **Oral Motor Exercises**:
    *   **Lip Exercises**: Practice lip rounding, spreading, and closure against resistance to address right facial palsy and improve oral seal.
    *   **Tongue Exercises**: Perform tongue range-of-motion exercises (protrusion, retraction, lateralization, elevation) and resistance exercises (e.g., pushing against a tongue depressor) to combat atrophy and improve bolus manipulation.
3.  **Pharyngeal and Laryngeal Strengthening**:
    *   **Mendelsohn Maneuver**: Practice voluntarily holding the larynx at its peak elevation during swallows to improve and prolong laryngeal excursion.
    *   **Effortful Swallow**: Practice swallowing with increased force to improve pharyngeal clearance, as indicated by residue on VFSS.
    *   **Chin Tuck Against Resistance (CTAR)**: As a safer alternative to the Shaker exercise, perform chin tucks against a ball or rolled towel to strengthen suprahyoid muscles.
4.  **Sensory Stimulation**:
    *   **Thermal-Tactile Stimulation (TTS)**: Apply a chilled laryngeal mirror to the anterior faucial arches to heighten sensory awareness and reduce the delay in swallow initiation observed on VFSS.
5.  **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**: Apply surface electrodes to the suprahyoid muscle group to facilitate muscle contraction and assist with improving laryngeal elevation during swallowing exercises.
6.  **Therapeutic Trials**: Conduct supervised trials with minute amounts (1-3 mL) of dyed, highly thick puree. Utilize compensatory strategies identified in VFSS, such as chin tuck and effortful swallow, while closely monitoring for any signs of aspiration.

### B. Respiratory Rehabilitation and Tracheostomy Weaning

1.  **Post-Cryoablation Management**: Given the recent cryoablation of tracheal granulation tissue, this is a critical window for weaning.
2.  **Secretion Management**:
    *   Continue regular tracheal suctioning as needed.
    *   Implement postural drainage and manual chest percussion to mobilize secretions.
    *   Teach assisted coughing techniques to compensate for weak expiratory muscles.
3.  **Breathing Exercises**:
    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing**: Train the patient to use the diaphragm for more efficient breathing, reducing reliance on accessory muscles.
    *   **Incentive Spirometry**: Use to encourage deep inhalation, improve lung volume, and prevent atelectasis.
4.  **Respiratory Muscle Training (RMT)**: Initiate expiratory and inspiratory muscle training with a threshold pressure device to improve the strength and endurance of respiratory muscles.
5.  **Weaning Protocol**:
    *   **Speaking Valve Trials**: Begin trials with a one-way speaking valve (e.g., Passy-Muir Valve). This will restore a closed respiratory system, improve laryngeal sensation, facilitate a stronger cough, and allow for vocalization. Start with short periods (15-30 minutes) and gradually increase duration as tolerated, monitoring SpO2, heart rate, and work of breathing.
    *   **Tracheostomy Capping Trials**: Once the speaking valve is well-tolerated for extended periods, progress to capping trials. Systematically increase the duration of capping until the patient can tolerate it for 24-48 hours continuously, which is a prerequisite for decannulation.

### C. Physical Therapy (PT)

1.  **Strengthening Exercises**:
    *   Implement a program of progressive resistive exercises for all four limbs, focusing on the right hemiparetic side (targeting Grade 4 strength) and maintaining strength on the left side.
    *   Incorporate core stability exercises (e.g., pelvic tilts, bridging, seated trunk rotations) to provide a stable base for limb movement and balance.
2.  **Balance and Transfer Training**:
    *   **Sitting Balance**: Progress from static to dynamic sitting balance exercises (e.g., reaching outside base of support).
    *   **Transfer Training**: Practice sit-to-stand transfers, initially with maximum assistance, progressing to less assistance as lower limb and core strength improve. Utilize proper body mechanics to ensure safety.
    *   **Standing Balance**: Once sit-to-stand is achieved, begin static standing practice in parallel bars.
3.  **Gait Training Preparation**:
    *   Initiate pre-gait activities in parallel bars, including weight-shifting, marching in place, and single-leg stance.
4.  **Modalities**:
    *   Consider Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) for the right ankle dorsiflexors and quadriceps during therapeutic exercises to facilitate muscle re-education and improve motor control.

### D. Occupational Therapy (OT)

1.  **Upper Limb Functional Training**:
    *   Focus on task-oriented training for the right arm and hand, such as grasping/releasing objects of various sizes and weights.
    *   Utilize mirror therapy to promote motor recovery of the right hand.
    *   Introduce bilateral arm training to improve coordination.
2.  **Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Retraining**:
    *   Break down ADL tasks (grooming, dressing, self-feeding once cleared) into manageable steps.
    *   Teach one-handed techniques and provide adaptive equipment as needed.
    *   Practice these activities in a real-world context (e.g., at the bedside sink).
3.  **Cognitive and Perceptual Training**:
    *   Address the impaired right eye movement by teaching compensatory strategies, such as active head turning to the right to scan the environment and prevent neglect of the right visual field.

### E. Nutritional Management

1.  **Dietitian Consultation**: Maintain close collaboration with a dietitian.
2.  **Enteral Nutrition Plan**: Continue nasogastric tube feeding with a high-protein, high-calorie formula to meet the increased metabolic demands of rehabilitation and promote weight gain. Ensure adequate hydration.
3.  **Monitoring**: Perform weekly weight checks and regular monitoring of nutritional laboratory markers to adjust the feeding plan as needed.

### F. Nursing Care and Patient/Family Education

1.  **Tracheostomy and Oral Care**: Provide meticulous tracheostomy site care to prevent infection. Perform frequent, thorough oral hygiene to reduce the bacterial load in the oral cavity, thereby minimizing the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
2.  **Positioning and Mobility**: Implement a regular turning schedule to prevent pressure injuries. Ensure the patient is positioned upright in a chair for several hours a day to improve respiratory mechanics and alertness.
3.  **Education**: Provide comprehensive education to the patient and her family regarding the rehabilitation goals, the rationale for current restrictions (especially NPO), signs of respiratory distress, and their role in the rehabilitation process. Ensure they understand the step-by-step plan for tracheostomy weaning to manage expectations.
