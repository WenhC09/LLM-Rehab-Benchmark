# 1. Rehabilitation Goals
## Short-term Goals
Stabilize the patient's vital signs and treat/reduce upper airway edema; enhance nutritional management to improve malnutrition; improve respiratory function, enhance cough effectiveness and airway protection, and reduce the risk of hypostatic pneumonia and aspiration through airway clearance techniques and breathing exercises; improve swallowing-related muscle function and limb mobility; improve airway stenosis via surgical excision of tracheal granuloma; prepare for decannulation by trialing a speaking valve and intermittent tube occlusion; initiate therapeutic oral intake under strict safety precautions.

## Long-term Goals
Achieve tracheostomy tube decannulation and restore normal breathing patterns; establish safe oral intake, remove the nasogastric tube, and improve nutritional status and quality of life; restore verbal communication; enhance limb function to achieve independent ambulation and activities of daily living (ADL) self-care; provide effective psychological counseling to build confidence in overcoming the disease and facilitate social reintegration.

# 2. Treatment Methods
## Swallowing Function Therapy
*   **Basic Function Training:**
    *   **Head/Neck Control Training:** Perform active and resisted neck exercises to increase range of motion (ROM) and strength, reduce muscle tone, and provide stability for swallowing.
    *   **Sensory Stimulation Training:** Apply neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), thermal-tactile (ice) stimulation, vibration, and air pulse technology to the face, oral cavity, and pharynx to enhance pharyngeal sensation, strengthen the pharyngeal reflex, and facilitate swallow initiation.
    *   **Labial/Lingual Function Training:** Implement active and resisted lip/tongue exercises to improve symmetry, coordination, and strength.
    *   **Swallowing Muscle Strengthening:** Utilize active exercises including effortful swallow and tongue-hold swallow (Masako maneuver) to increase oropharyngeal pressure and enhance pharyngeal constrictor function; improve soft palate elevation via sustained /a/ phonation; augment laryngeal elevation amplitude/duration using the Mendelsohn maneuver.
    *   **Phonation Training:** Increase sustained /i/ phonation exercises to improve vocal fold closure.
*   **Airway Protection & Feeding Training:**
    *   **Airway Protection Training:** Instruct in supraglottic swallow technique to actively protect the airway during swallowing and reduce penetration/aspiration.
    *   **Speaking Valve Training:** Trial a speaking valve in later stages to restore laryngeal/upper airway pressure/flow, thereby improving swallowing physiology and facilitating verbal communication.
    *   **Direct Therapeutic Feeding:** Initiate supervised trials with pureed foods post-swallowing function improvement assessment, integrating training with actual intake to progressively restore oral feeding.

## Respiratory Function Therapy
*   **Airway Clearance Techniques:**
    *   Perform high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) and manual vibration for sputum clearance twice daily (20 mins/session).
    *   Implement thoracic expansion exercises from the active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) to improve alveolar ventilation, combined with forced expiration technique (FET) for peripheral secretion clearance once daily.
    *   Administer manual hyperinflation (MH) once daily to assist secretion clearance and improve oxygenation.
*   **Respiratory Muscle Strength & Endurance Training:**
    *   Conduct pursed-lip breathing, external diaphragm pacing, and upper/lower limb isokinetic strength training daily (20 mins) to enhance ventilation, optimize breathing patterns, and strengthen respiratory/accessory muscles.
*   **Cough Function & Thoracic Mobility Training:**
    *   Perform huffing exercises twice daily (3-5 sets/session) to increase expiratory flow and improve cough efficacy.
    *   Incorporate intermittent speaking valve use during breathing exercises (20-30 mins daily) in later stages to further enhance respiratory function.

## Nutritional Management
Adjust the enteral nutrition regimen dynamically based on nutritional assessment and gastrointestinal function. Gradually increase enteral nutrition solution from an initial 1000 mL/day to a maintenance dose of 1500 mL/day to ensure adequate nutritional support.

## Rehabilitation Nursing
*   **Airway Care:** Maintain strict aseptic technique. Perform suctioning as needed to ensure patency. Provide tracheostomy stoma care once daily, adequate airway humidification, and appropriate oxygen therapy. Administer rinsing oral care twice daily to reduce oral/pulmonary infection risk.
*   **Condition Monitoring:** Closely observe consciousness level, vital signs, and oxygen therapy efficacy to promptly identify/manage potential issues.
*   **Nutrition & Swallowing Care:** Transition from indwelling nasogastric tube to intermittent catheterization (4 times/day) using gentle, precise technique to minimize laryngeal irritation. This indirectly trains swallowing and transitions from passive support to self-care.
*   **ADL & Psychological Care:** Actively assist and instruct in activities of daily living (ADL). Provide ongoing psychological counseling to encourage active participation in rehabilitation and build confidence in disease management.
