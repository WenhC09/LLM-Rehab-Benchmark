# Medical Record Information

## I. Medical Summary

**Patient Demographics**: Female, 67 years old.

**Chief Complaint**: Postoperative cerebellar tumor with right limb dyskinesia and dysphagia for over 4 months.

**Present Illness**: The patient developed progressively worsening gait instability with dizziness and headache in February 2023 without obvious precipitating factors. External cranial CT revealed a cerebellar space-occupying lesion. She underwent surgical treatment in our neurosurgery department on May 8, 2023. Postoperative pulmonary infection necessitated tracheostomy on May 12, 2023. After stabilization, she was discharged. Subsequent rehabilitation at an external facility failed to resolve residual symptoms including right limb dyskinesia, dysphagia, dysarthria, and facial paralysis. Admitted to our department for further rehabilitation on June 21, 2023. On admission: long-term nasogastric tube feeding, persistent tracheostomy, excessive drooling, and 5kg weight loss since disease onset.

**Physical Examination**: Alert with normal cognition, memory, orientation, and calculation. Cooperative with examination. Bilateral pupils equal and round (3.0mm diameter), light reflex intact. Impaired right eye movement. Right central facial paralysis with tongue deviation to right upon protrusion. Dry surgical scalp wound without exudate. Supple neck with patent tracheostomy stoma showing white viscous sputum. Coarse breath sounds bilaterally with scattered moist rales. Soft, non-distended abdomen without rebound tenderness or guarding. Voluntary limb movement present. Muscle strength: right upper limb ≈Grade 3, right lower limb ≈Grade 3+, left limbs ≈Grade 4. Bilateral Babinski sign positive.

**Ancillary Investigations**:
*   **Cranial MRI (May 21, 2023)**: ① Acute infarction (likely with minor hemorrhage) in right pons, medulla, and middle cerebellar peduncle; ② Widened right cerebellopontine angle cistern with postoperative changes in right occipital region; ③ Bilateral scattered punctate white matter hyperintensities in frontoparietal lobes and corona radiata (Fazekas grade 2); ④ Right fetal-type posterior cerebral artery (congenital variant).
*   **Neck CT (June 22, 2023)**: Symmetric neck soft tissues with small lymph nodes. Normal thyroid, bilateral submandibular and parotid glands. Nasogastric tube and tracheostomy tube present. Suboptimal visualization of nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx. Symmetric parapharyngeal spaces without stenosis or lymphadenopathy. Suggestive of paranasal sinusitis.
*   **Electronic Laryngoscopy (June 25, 2023)**: Oropharyngeal mucosal edema obscuring view of oropharynx, epiglottis, and vocal cords. Diagnoses: ① Allergic rhinitis; ② Chronic sinusitis; ③ Left inferior nasal concha polyp.
*   **Bronchoscopy (August 2, 2023)**: Performed due to desaturation and progressive oxygen decline during training. Revealed granulomatous hyperplasia at anterior tracheal wall causing lumen stenosis. Subsequent bronchoscopic cryoablation of granuloma performed on August 7, 2023.

**Clinical Diagnoses**:
1.  Postoperative status of cerebellar tumor resection
2.  Postoperative status of facial nerve decompression
3.  Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia
4.  Difficult tracheostomy decannulation

**Functional Diagnoses**:
1.  Dysphagia
2.  Hemiplegia
3.  Dysarthria
4.  Partial assistance required for activities of daily living

## II. Post-admission Functional Assessment

### 1. Swallowing Function Assessment
*   **Clinical Evaluation (June 21, 2023)**: Alert with right facial paralysis. Full head/neck ROM. Continuous nasogastric feeding with plastic tracheostomy tube. Sialorrhea with thick sputum coating on tongue. Mildly restricted mouth opening (2cm), asymmetric lip movement. Tongue atrophy with significant restriction in left/upward motion. Asymmetric palatal elevation. Aphonic due to tracheostomy. Laryngeal elevation <1cm during swallow. Impaired voluntary throat clearing. Diminished pharyngeal reflex, cough reflex, and gag reflex.
    *   **Repetitive Saliva Swallowing Test (RSST)**: 2 swallows/30 seconds.
    *   **Water Swallowing Test**: Grade 5.
    *   **Dye Test**: Laryngeal elevation observed within 10s post-swallow. Oxygen saturation decreased >3%. Colored secretions aspirated from tracheostomy.

*   **Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) (June 25, 2023)**: Copious secretions in bilateral pyriform sinuses and supraglottic region. Marked laryngeal/epiglottic edema preventing visualization of oropharynx, epiglottis, and vocal cords.

*   **Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) (July 15, 2023)**: Consumed 3mL moderately thick and 3mL extremely thick liquids in seated position. Findings:
    *   **Oral Phase**: Normal head control. Mild impairment in oral containment/bolus transport.
    *   **Pharyngeal Phase**: Significant swallow initiation delay. No nasopharyngeal reflux. Minimal residue in bilateral valleculae/pyriform sinuses (Yale Scale Grade 1), mostly cleared by repeated effortful swallows.
    *   **Aspiration**: Penetration-aspiration observed with both consistencies (PAS Score 2). Intact cough reflex with weak cough strength.
    *   **Conclusion**: ① Oropharyngeal dysphagia; ② Overt aspiration.

### 2. Respiratory Function Assessment
*   **Assessment Date**: June 21, 2023
*   **Status**: Tracheostomy with high-flow oxygen support.
*   **Respiratory Rate**: 18/min.
*   **Breath Depth**: Shallow.
*   **Thoracic Mobility**: Normal chest shape, excursion <1.5cm.
*   **Sputum Clearance**: Profuse sputum. Unable to expectorate orally. Weak cough (SCSS Score 2).
*   **Dyspnea Scales**:
    *   mMRC: Grade 2.
    *   Borg Scale: Rest=0, Exertion=4.

### 3. Nutritional Assessment
*   **Assessment Dates**: June 21, 2023 & July 10, 2023
*   **Anthropometrics**: Height 152cm, Admission weight 40kg, BMI 17.3.
*   **Nutritional Risk Screening**: NRS-2002 Score 4 (moderate malnutrition risk), underweight.

### 4. Nursing Assessment
*   **Assessment Date**: June 21, 2023
*   **Status**: Plastic tracheostomy tube in situ. Copious oral secretions present.
