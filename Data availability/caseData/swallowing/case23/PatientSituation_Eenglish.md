# Medical Record Information

## I. Medical Summary

*   **Basic Information**: Male patient, 70 years old.  
*   **Chief Complaint**: Dysphagia for over 3 years.  
*   **Present Illness**: The patient underwent horizontal partial laryngectomy for laryngeal cancer in 2019, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (details unspecified). In 2020, he underwent tracheotomy and gastrostomy due to "aspiration pneumonia." After active anti-infective treatment controlled the infection, the gastrostomy tube was removed, and a nasogastric tube was placed. Repeated self-removal of the nasogastric tube led to recurrent pulmonary infections due to aspiration. Currently, the patient presents with dysphagia, tracheostomy status, and difficulty expectorating, seeking further treatment at our hospital.  
*   **Clinical Diagnosis**:  
    1.  Postoperative status of laryngeal malignancy  
    2.  Tracheostomy status  
    3.  Pulmonary infection  
    4.  Anemia  
    5.  Hypoproteinemia  
*   **Functional Diagnosis**:  
    1.  Swallowing dysfunction  
    2.  Pulmonary dysfunction  
    3.  Speech dysfunction  

## II. Pre-Rehabilitation Functional Assessment

### 1. Clinical Assessment (Initial Assessment Date: April 8, 2022)

*   **Dye Test**: Positive (for detecting aspiration).  
*   **Repetitive Saliva Swallowing Test (RSST)**: 1 time.  
*   **Swallowing Function Assessment**:  
    *   **Oral Motor Function**: Mouth opening amplitude 2.8 cm; laryngeal elevation amplitude 1.5 cm; mild restriction in tongue elevation; reduced lip rounding/spreading.  
    *   **Cervical Range of Motion**: Neck flexion 20°, extension 20°, lateral flexion (left/right) 30°, rotation (left/right) 45°.  
    *   **Volume-Viscosity Swallow Test (V-VST)**: Oxygen saturation decreased by 5% with 5 mL thick liquid and puree, indicating impaired safety and efficacy. Thin liquid not tested.  
*   **Respiratory Function Assessment**:  
    *   **Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF)**: 1.97 L/s.  
    *   **Peak Inspiratory Flow (PIF)**: 1.149 L/s.  
    *   **Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP)**: 17 cmH₂O (Normal predicted value: 95 cmH₂O).  
    *   **Maximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP)**: 33 cmH₂O (Normal predicted value: 95 cmH₂O).  
    *   **Respiratory Rate**: 18 breaths/min.  
    *   **Oxygen Saturation at Rest**: 95%.  
    *   **Speaking Valve Tolerance**: 5 minutes.  
*   **Nutritional Assessment**: Height 175 cm, weight 55 kg, BMI 18.0 (underweight range). NRS-2002 score: 5 points (indicating nutritional risk).  
*   **Nursing Assessment**: Dry oral cavity, reduced salivary secretion; tracheostomy tube diameter 10 mm; significant gap between tracheostomy stoma and outer tracheal cannula.  
*   **Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS)**: 60 points.  

### 2. Instrumental Examinations

*   **Laryngoscopy (April 10, 2022)**: Normal epiglottis morphology. Post-partial laryngectomy changes observed in the larynx. Soft tissue swelling at the glottis, vocal cord edema; impaired left vocal cord mobility, right vocal cord thickening. Pharyngeal cavity narrowing, wheezing during respiration.  
*   **Bronchoscopy (April 12, 2022)**: Glottic soft tissue swelling; abnormal vocal cord movement; mild stenosis in the upper trachea with mucosal congestion and edema. Mucosal congestion, edema, and thick secretions observed in the visible left and right bronchi; secretions suctioned.  

### 3. Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS)

In natural sitting position, aspiration occurred with all tested food consistencies (Levels 1, 2, 3). Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) score: Level 6. Findings: Slow oral control and transit; significant residue in bilateral valleculae and pyriform sinuses, not cleared by repeated swallows; delayed swallowing initiation; incomplete upper esophageal sphincter (UES) opening. Aspiration occurred without overt coughing.  
**Standardized Barium Swallow Impairment Profile (SBSIP) Score (Total: 23 points)**:  
*   Food preparation/mastication: 2 points  
*   Oral residue: 1 point  
*   Initiation of pharyngeal swallow: 1 point  
*   Laryngeal elevation: 2 points  
*   Hyoid anterior movement: 1 point  
*   Epiglottic movement: 1 point  
*   Laryngeal vestibule closure: 1 point  
*   Pharyngeal stripping wave: 1 point  
*   Pharyngoesophageal segment (PES) opening: 1 point  
*   Tongue base retraction: 1 point
