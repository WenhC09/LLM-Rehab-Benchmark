# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks)
1. Improve airway clearance ability, reduce secretion retention, and lower risk of pulmonary infection.
2. Increase tolerance time for speaking valve use from 5 minutes to ≥15 minutes.
3. Enhance oral motor range of motion and laryngeal elevation amplitude by at least 0.3–0.5 cm.
4. Improve respiratory muscle strength (MIP and MEP) by ≥10% from baseline values.
5. Maintain or slightly increase body weight through safe nutritional support.
6. Reduce aspiration episodes during therapeutic swallowing trials with controlled bolus volumes and viscosities.

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months)
1. Achieve safer and more efficient swallowing with selected food textures, minimizing aspiration risk as assessed by VFSS.
2. Prolonged speaking valve tolerance to >30 minutes, with improved voice intelligibility.
3. Optimize respiratory function to support speech and swallowing safety.
4. Achieve stable nutritional status with BMI ≥19.0 without frequent pulmonary infections.
5. Improve quality of life and reduce anxiety (target SAS score <50).

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Swallowing Function Rehabilitation
1. **Oral motor exercises**  
   * Range of motion and strengthening exercises for lips, tongue, and jaw (e.g., lip rounding/spreading, tongue elevation/lateralization, jaw opening/closing).
2. **Laryngeal and hyoid movement facilitation**  
   * Effortful swallow, Mendelsohn maneuver training (as tolerated), Shaker exercise or modified jaw-opening against resistance to improve UES opening.
3. **Sensory stimulation**  
   * Thermal-tactile stimulation (cold stimulus to anterior faucial pillars) to trigger earlier swallow initiation.
4. **Postural adjustments**  
   * Chin-tuck posture during therapeutic trials to reduce aspiration risk.
5. **Compensatory strategies**  
   * Small bolus volume training with thickened liquids or puree under therapist supervision.
6. **Swallowing therapy frequency**  
   * 5–6 sessions/week, 20–30 minutes/session, individualized progression based on tolerance and VFSS/dye test feedback.

### B. Respiratory Function and Airway Clearance
1. **Respiratory muscle training**  
   * Inspiratory and expiratory muscle training using threshold devices, starting at 30% of measured MIP/MEP, progressing gradually.
2. **Airway clearance techniques**  
   * Assisted cough training, manually assisted expirations, and use of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation if necessary.
3. **Speaking valve acclimatization**  
   * Gradual increase in wearing time, monitoring oxygen saturation and patient tolerance; begin with 5–10 minutes 2–3 times/day and increase as tolerated.
4. **Breathing exercises**  
   * Diaphragmatic breathing, pursed-lip breathing to improve ventilation efficiency.

### C. Nutritional Support
1. **Nutritional route**  
   * Maintain adequate enteral feeding via safest available route (e.g., nasogastric or gastrostomy) until oral intake is deemed safe.
2. **Dietary modification**  
   * Use of thickened liquids or purees for therapy trials only, avoiding unsafe consistencies.
3. **Nutritional supplementation**  
   * High-protein, high-calorie formulas, with dietitian involvement; monitor serum albumin and hemoglobin.

### D. Speech and Communication Training
1. **Speaking valve–based phonation training**  
   * Begin once respiratory tolerance improves; focus on short phrases, breath support, and articulation clarity.
2. **Alternative communication tools**  
   * Use of writing boards or electronic devices during periods without speaking valve.

### E. Psychological Support
1. **Anxiety management**  
   * Psychological counseling, relaxation training, and patient education on rehabilitation process.
2. **Family education**  
   * Training caregivers on safe feeding, airway suctioning, speaking valve handling.

### F. Medical and Nursing Coordination
1. **Airway management**  
   * Ensure proper tracheostomy tube fit to minimize leakage and aspiration risk.
2. **Pulmonary infection prevention**  
   * Aggressive oral hygiene, humidified oxygen, regular suctioning as needed.
3. **Close monitoring**  
   * Regular reassessment of swallowing safety (VFSS or fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing) and respiratory function every 4–6 weeks.
