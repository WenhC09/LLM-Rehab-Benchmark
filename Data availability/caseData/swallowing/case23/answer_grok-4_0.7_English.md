# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks):
- Improve swallowing safety to reduce aspiration risk (target: Penetration-Aspiration Scale score ≤4 with modified consistencies).
- Enhance respiratory muscle strength (increase MIP to ≥30 cmH₂O and MEP to ≥50 cmH₂O).
- Improve speaking valve tolerance to ≥30 minutes continuously.
- Optimize nutritional status (increase BMI to ≥18.5 through enteral nutrition).
- Reduce anxiety (SAS score <50).

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
- Achieve safe oral intake with modified food textures (puree/thick liquids) without aspiration.
- Restore functional respiratory capacity for tracheostomy decannulation candidacy (MIP ≥60 cmH₂O, MEP ≥70 cmH₂O).
- Regain functional communication through tracheostomy speaking valve or alternative methods.
- Achieve stable nutritional status (BMI ≥20) with potential transition to partial oral intake.
- Maintain psychological well-being with minimal anxiety (SAS score ≤40).

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Swallowing Rehabilitation
- **Swallowing Therapy** (5 sessions/week, 30–45 min/session):
  - **Oral Motor Exercises**: Lip closure, tongue elevation, and buccal muscle strengthening (e.g., resistance exercises with tongue depressor, 3 sets of 10 reps) to address reduced lip rounding and tongue elevation.
  - **Mendelsohn Maneuver**: To improve laryngeal elevation and UES opening (10 reps, hold for 2–3 seconds, 3 sets/session).
  - **Effortful Swallow**: To enhance pharyngeal clearance and reduce residue (10 reps, 3 sets/session).
  - **Supraglottic Swallow**: To promote airway protection during swallowing (practice with saliva, 10 reps, 3 sets/session).
  - **Compensatory Strategies**: Chin-tuck posture during swallowing trials to minimize aspiration risk; use of thickened liquids (IDDSI Level 3) and puree diets (IDDSI Level 4) based on VFSS findings.
- **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)** (3 sessions/week): Target suprahyoid muscles to improve laryngeal elevation and UES opening, using a protocol of 30 minutes at 5–10 mA intensity, adjusted for patient tolerance.
- **Dietary Modifications**: Continue nasogastric tube feeding with high-calorie, high-protein formula (target: 2000–2200 kcal/day, 80–100 g protein/day) to address hypoproteinemia and underweight status (BMI 18.0). Collaborate with dietitian for weekly nutritional monitoring (NRS-2002 reassessment).

### Respiratory Rehabilitation
- **Respiratory Muscle Training (RMT)** (5 sessions/week, 15–20 min/session):
  - Inspiratory muscle training with threshold device set at 30–40% of MIP (17 cmH₂O), progressing to 50% as tolerated (3 sets of 10 breaths).
  - Expiratory muscle training with threshold device set at 30–40% of MEP (33 cmH₂O), progressing to 50% (3 sets of 10 breaths).
  - Monitor PEF and PIF weekly to track progress.
- **Airway Clearance Techniques** (daily):
  - Manual chest physiotherapy (percussion and postural drainage, 10–15 min/session) to mobilize bronchial secretions.
  - Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy using a device (e.g., Acapella) to improve secretion clearance (10–15 min, 2–3 times/day).
- **Speaking Valve Training** (5 sessions/week):
  - Gradual increase in Passy-Muir valve use, starting at 5–10 min/session, increasing by 5 min/week as tolerated, with oxygen saturation and respiratory rate monitoring.
  - Coordinate with speech-language pathologist (SLP) to ensure airway patency and vocal cord function during trials.

### Speech and Communication
- **Speech Therapy** (3 sessions/week, 30 min/session):
  - Focus on compensatory voicing strategies (e.g., esophageal speech or electrolarynx training) due to impaired vocal cord mobility and glottic swelling.
  - Practice articulation exercises to improve clarity with speaking valve use.
  - Assess potential for tracheostomy downsizing or decannulation based on bronchoscopy and respiratory progress.

### Nutritional Support
- **Enteral Nutrition Management**: Continue nasogastric tube feeding with close monitoring to prevent self-removal. Secure tube with nasal bridle if recurrent removal persists.
- **Oral Hygiene Protocol**: Daily oral care (brushing, antiseptic rinse) to address dry oral cavity and reduced salivary secretion, reducing infection risk.
- **Weekly Nutritional Assessment**: Monitor weight, serum albumin, and prealbumin levels to address anemia and hypoproteinemia. Adjust caloric intake based on BMI progress.

### Psychological Support
- **Psychological Counseling** (1 session/week, 30–45 min):
  - Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address anxiety (SAS score 60), focusing on coping strategies for tracheostomy and swallowing difficulties.
  - Educate patient on rehabilitation process to enhance engagement and reduce distress.
- **Support Group Referral**: Connect patient with local or virtual support groups for tracheostomy and laryngeal cancer patients to improve emotional resilience.

### Tracheostomy Care
- **Tracheostomy Management** (daily):
  - Regular cleaning and suctioning to prevent infection and manage secretions, addressing bronchoscopy findings of thick secretions.
  - Assess tracheostomy stoma for fit and consider downsizing tube (current 10 mm) if glottic swelling reduces, in consultation with ENT specialist.
  - Monitor for skin breakdown around stoma due to significant gap between stoma and cannula.

### Monitoring and Follow-Up
- **Weekly Assessments**:
  - Reassess swallowing function (V-VST, RSST) and respiratory parameters (MIP, MEP, PEF, PIF).
  - Monitor oxygen saturation and respiratory rate during speaking valve trials and swallowing exercises.
  - Track nutritional markers (weight, BMI, serum proteins).
- **Monthly Instrumental Evaluations**:
  - Repeat VFSS to evaluate aspiration risk and swallowing progress.
  - Follow-up laryngoscopy/bronchoscopy to monitor glottic swelling and tracheal stenosis.
- **Multidisciplinary Team Coordination**: Weekly meetings with SLP, dietitian, respiratory therapist, ENT specialist, and psychologist to adjust plan based on progress.

### Patient Education
- Educate patient and caregivers on tracheostomy care, swallowing strategies, and nutritional goals to enhance compliance and reduce complications (e.g., aspiration pneumonia recurrence).
- Provide written and verbal instructions for home-based exercises (oral motor, RMT) and safe swallowing techniques.
