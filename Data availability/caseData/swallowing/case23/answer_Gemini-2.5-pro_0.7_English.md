# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

**Date of Plan:** April 13, 2022

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (Next 2-4 weeks):

1.  **Prevent Aspiration and Improve Pulmonary Status:**
    *   Maintain strict Nil Per Os (NPO) status to eliminate risk of food/liquid aspiration.
    *   Improve airway clearance by increasing peak expiratory flow and facilitating effective secretion management.
    *   Initiate respiratory muscle strengthening to improve inspiratory and expiratory pressures.
    *   Increase speaking valve tolerance to at least 15-20 minutes continuously under supervision, while maintaining SpO₂ >92%.

2.  **Optimize Nutritional and Medical Status:**
    *   Ensure adequate caloric and protein intake via nasogastric tube to address hypoproteinemia and support muscle strengthening.
    *   Collaborate with the primary medical team to manage anemia and pulmonary infection.
    *   Strongly recommend consultation for Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement for long-term, safe nutritional access.

3.  **Initiate Foundational Swallowing and Motor Training:**
    *   Improve oral motor control and strength (lips, tongue).
    *   Enhance hyolaryngeal elevation and pharyngeal constriction through indirect (non-swallowing) exercises.
    *   Improve cervical range of motion to facilitate optimal positioning for future swallow trials.

4.  **Manage Psychological Distress:**
    *   Reduce patient's anxiety level through education and initial coping strategies.

### Long-term goals (Next 3-6 months):

1.  **Re-establish Safe Oral Intake:**
    *   Achieve safe swallowing of at least puree consistency foods (Level 4) and mildly thick liquids (Level 2) without aspiration (PAS score ≤ 2), to supplement tube feedings.
    *   Progress towards safe intake of a modified diet that meets partial nutritional needs.

2.  **Achieve Tracheostomy Decannulation:**
    *   Achieve respiratory muscle strength (MIP/MEP) sufficient for an effective cough (> 60 cmH₂O).
    *   Demonstrate ability to manage secretions effectively without frequent suctioning.
    *   Pass a 24-hour tracheostomy tube capping trial.

3.  **Improve Functional Communication:**
    *   Achieve consistent use of a speaking valve for functional verbal communication throughout the day.

4.  **Enhance Overall Function and Quality of Life:**
    *   Achieve nutritional stability (BMI > 18.5) with a combination of oral and enteral intake.
    *   Improve overall strength and endurance.
    *   Reduce anxiety to a subclinical level (SAS score < 50).

## 2. Treatment Methods

### I. Swallowing Rehabilitation

*   **Status:** Strict NPO. Patient education on the rationale is critical to ensure compliance and reduce anxiety.
*   **Indirect Therapy (No food or liquid):**
    *   **Laryngeal Elevation/Pharyngeal Strength:**
        *   **Shaker Exercise (Head Lifts):** 3 sets of 30 repetitions, plus 3 sustained holds of 60 seconds each, performed daily to target suprahyoid muscles and improve UES opening.
        *   **Mendelsohn Maneuver (Dry Swallows):** Practice volitionally holding the larynx at its peak elevation for 3-5 seconds during a saliva swallow. 5-10 repetitions, 3 times daily.
        *   **Effortful Swallow (Dry Swallows):** Instruct patient to swallow saliva as forcefully as possible. 5-10 repetitions, 3 times daily.
    *   **Tongue Strength and Control:**
        *   **Tongue Press Exercise:** Patient pushes tongue against a tongue depressor (anteriorly and laterally). 3 sets of 10 repetitions.
        *   **Tongue Base Retraction:** Practice yawning, gargling (without liquid), and the Masako maneuver (tongue-hold dry swallow) to strengthen the tongue base. 5-10 repetitions, 3 times daily.
    *   **Oral Motor Exercises:** Lip rounding and spreading exercises against resistance. 3 sets of 10 repetitions.
*   **Sensory Stimulation:**
    *   **Thermal-Tactile Stimulation (TTS):** Use a chilled laryngeal mirror to stroke the anterior faucial arches prior to saliva swallows to improve swallow trigger timeliness.
    *   **Oral Hygiene:** Meticulous oral care 3-4 times daily using flavored swabs to maintain hygiene, provide sensory input, and manage dry mouth.

### II. Respiratory Rehabilitation

*   **Respiratory Muscle Training (RMT):**
    *   **Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT):** Use a threshold IMT device. Start at 30% of MIP (approx. 5 cmH₂O). Perform 30 breaths, twice daily.
    *   **Expiratory Muscle Training (EMT):** Use a threshold EMT device. Start at 30% of MEP (approx. 10 cmH₂O). Perform 30 breaths, twice daily.
    *   Intensity for both IMT/EMT to be increased weekly as tolerated.
*   **Airway Clearance:**
    *   **Manual Assisted Cough:** Teach patient and caregivers how to perform a manually assisted cough timed with expiratory effort.
    *   **Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation:** If available, utilize a CoughAssist device to augment secretion clearance, especially before and after speaking valve trials.
    *   **Tracheostomy Management:** Regular suctioning as needed. Evaluate for a different size/type of tracheostomy tube to reduce the stoma-to-tube gap and improve airflow dynamics for speaking valve use.
*   **Speaking Valve Protocol:**
    *   Begin with short, supervised trials (5 minutes) with the cuff deflated (if applicable).
    *   Monitor SpO₂, respiratory rate, heart rate, and work of breathing continuously during trials.
    *   Gradually increase duration daily as tolerated, with rest periods in between.

### III. Nutritional Management

*   **Enteral Feeding:** Continue nasogastric tube feeding as prescribed.
*   **Dietitian Consultation:** Formal consultation to establish a high-protein, high-calorie feeding regimen to correct hypoproteinemia, anemia, and achieve a positive nitrogen balance.
*   **PEG Tube Recommendation:** Discuss the benefits of PEG tube placement with the patient, family, and primary medical team for long-term safety and nutritional management.

### IV. Physical Therapy

*   **Cervical Range of Motion:** Active-assisted and passive range of motion exercises for neck flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and rotation to improve mobility within pain-free limits.
*   **General Conditioning:** A graded exercise program focusing on core stability, seated endurance, and upper/lower extremity strengthening to combat deconditioning.

### V. Psychological Support

*   **Patient and Family Education:** Provide clear, repeated explanations of all findings, the treatment plan, and realistic short-term and long-term goals.
*   **Anxiety Management:** Teach basic relaxation and diaphragmatic breathing techniques.
*   **Referral:** Recommend formal consultation with a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist for management of anxiety.
