### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

**Short-Term Goals (6 weeks):**
*   **Respiratory Function:** Enhance airway clearance ability, correct abnormal breathing patterns, and progressively prolong the duration of speaking valve usage.
*   **Swallowing Function:** Reduce aspiration caused by saliva or secretions, strengthen the swallowing reflex, improve cricopharyngeal muscle opening, and increase cervical range of motion.
*   **Adjusted Goal:** After Phase I treatment, adjust based on actual condition: Achieve partial oral intake of food with the tracheostomy tube cuff inflated and actively clear secretions from the main airways.

**Long-Term Goals (3 months):**
*   **Respiratory Function:** Comprehensively improve respiratory capacity to create conditions for eventual tracheostomy tube decannulation.
*   **Swallowing Function:** Remove the nasogastric tube and achieve complete oral intake.

### 2. Treatment Methods

Rehabilitation for this case involves two in-hospital phases and one home-based phase, as detailed below:

**Phase I Comprehensive Rehabilitation (2022-04-08 — 2022-05-06)**

*   **Cervical Muscle Release:**
    *   **Cervical Massage:** Once daily, 5 times/week, 10 minutes/session. Targets relaxation of cervical muscles, facial buccinator and masseter muscles, bilateral sternocleidomastoid muscles, posterior trapezius, splenius capitis, splenius cervicis, and levator scapulae muscles.
    *   **Cervical Muscle Stretching:** Once daily, 5 times/week, 10 minutes/session. Stretching exercises for muscles involved in cervical flexion, lateral flexion, and extension.

*   **Swallowing Function Training:**
    *   **Ice Stick Stimulation:** Once daily, 5 times/week, 5 minutes/session. Apply ice stick to brush base of tongue and soft palate, followed by guided dry swallow.
    *   **Tongue Muscle Strengthening:** Once daily, 5 times/week, 5 minutes/session. Use tongue retractor to protrude tongue, instruct patient to forcefully retract tongue, combined with dry swallow.
    *   **Balloon Tongue Pressure Training:** Once daily, 5 times/week, 5 minutes/session. Place balloon on tongue surface, instruct patient to elevate tongue to compress balloon and hold for 3-5 seconds.
    *   **Balloon Dilation Therapy:** 5 times/week. Insert balloon-tipped catheter orally into esophagus, inflate with 4 mL ice water, slowly withdraw catheter to inferior border of cricopharyngeus, instruct patient to swallow forcefully while therapist withdraws catheter. 8 repetitions/set.
    *   **Suprahyoid/Infrahyoid Muscle Training:** 5 times/week. Apply low-frequency electrical stimulation with electrodes placed superiorly and inferiorly to suprahyoid muscles, 20 minutes/session. Concurrently perform modified Shaker exercise, 2 sets/day, 10 repetitions/set.
    *   **Pharyngeal Pressure Training:** 2 sets/day, 5 times/week. Instruct patient to suck forcefully through a blocked straw, maintaining pharyngeal contraction for 6-10 seconds. 10 repetitions/set.

*   **Pulmonary Rehabilitation:**
    *   **Speaking Valve Use:** Gradually increase wearing time based on patient tolerance.
    *   **External Diaphragm Pacemaker Stimulation:** Once daily, 5 times/week, 15 minutes/session. Utilize 40Hz pulse frequency at 9 breaths/minute, intensity set to patient comfort.
    *   **Threshold Loading Inspiratory Muscle Training:** Once daily, 5 times/week. Set resistance at 50% of maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP). 30 repetitions/set, 2 sets total, with 2-3 tidal breaths between sets to prevent fatigue.

*   **Rehabilitation Nursing:**
    *   **Nutritional Support:** Intermittent tube feeding, 4 times/day, 500 mL/feed, 4-5 hour intervals, ensuring ~1800 kcal daily intake.
    *   **Airway Clearance:** Instruct effective coughing, combined with chest physiotherapy, abdominal thrusts, postural drainage, or mechanical vibration to maintain airway patency.
    *   **Tracheostomy Tube Care:** Change inner cannula daily, check patency, and secure outer tube to prevent dislodgement.

**Phase II Treatment (2022-05-06 — 2022-05-20)**

Building on Phase I, treatment adjusted due to glottic stenosis impeding decannulation. Subglottic suctioning tracheostomy tube utilized, adding:

*   **Swallowing Function Training:**
    *   **Airway Protection Maneuvers:** Focused training on supraglottic swallow and super-supraglottic swallow techniques.
    *   **Feeding Training:** Initiate oral intake training with pureed foods with tracheostomy tube cuff inflated (pressure ≥25 cmH₂O), gradually increasing food volume.

*   **Pulmonary Rehabilitation:**
    *   Wear speaking valve with cuff deflated, continuing progressive increase in duration.
    *   Continue Threshold Loading Training and airway clearance techniques.

*   **Rehabilitation Nursing:**
    *   **Cuff Management:** Monitor and maintain cuff pressure ≥25 cmH₂O pre- and during feeding. Post-feeding, suction supracuff secretions, deflate cuff, and instruct cough to expectorate.
    *   **Positioning:** Maintain upright or semi-Fowler's position for 30 minutes post-feeding to prevent gastroesophageal reflux.
    *   **Oral Care:** Perform oral hygiene promptly after feeding.

**Home-Based Rehabilitation Plan**

Discharge plan for maintaining and consolidating treatment effects:

*   **Swallowing Function Maintenance:**
    *   **Ice Stimulation with Effortful Swallow:** Once daily, 5-10 minutes/session.
    *   **Tongue Retraction Swallow Training:** 2 sets/day, 10 repetitions/set with swallow.
    *   **Balloon Tongue Pressure Training:** 10 repetitions/day.
    *   **Pharyngeal Pressure Training (Straw Sucking):** Maintain pharyngeal contraction for 6-10 seconds, 10 repetitions.
    *   **Modified Shaker Exercise:** Maintain position for 6-10 seconds, 10 repetitions.
    *   **Self-Administered Balloon Dilation:** Trained on fluoroscopy-guided technique during outpatient visit due to proximal esophageal stenosis. Perform once daily at home for long-term maintenance.

*   **Cervical Function Maintenance:**
    *   **Self-Directed Neck Exercises:** Twice daily, 5-10 minutes/session.

*   **Self-Feeding & Care:**
    *   **Feeding Protocol:** Inflate tracheostomy tube cuff (pressure ≥25 cmH₂O) before consuming pureed/soft foods. Post-feeding, actively cough to clear residue, then suction supracuff secretions and deflate cuff. Liquid nutrition continues via intermittent tube feeding.
    *   **Tracheostomy Tube Care:** Regular outpatient follow-up for tube disinfection and replacement.
