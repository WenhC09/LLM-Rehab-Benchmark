# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (4-8 weeks):
- Prevent aspiration events and reduce pulmonary infection risk through safe swallowing strategies
- Improve respiratory muscle strength (MIP target: ≥30 cmH₂O, MEP target: ≥50 cmH₂O)
- Increase speaking valve tolerance to ≥30 minutes daily
- Enhance oral hygiene and salivary management (reduce dry mouth)
- Achieve nutritional stabilization via enteral feeding (BMI target: ≥18.5)
- Reduce anxiety symptoms (SAS score target: <50)

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Establish safe oral intake for pleasure (minimal aspiration on thickened liquids)
- Achieve tracheostomy decannulation criteria
- Enable functional communication through alternative methods
- Restore independent airway clearance ability
- Transition to oral nutrition if clinically appropriate

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Dysphagia Management
- **Compensatory Strategies**:
  - Strict NPO status with continued NG feeding
  - Shaker exercise program (3x/day) to improve PES opening
  - Chin tuck during swallowing attempts under VFSS guidance
  - Thermal-tactile stimulation before swallowing trials
- **Direct Therapy**:
  - Effortful swallow training with EMG biofeedback
  - Masako maneuver (tongue-hold) for pharyngeal contraction
  - Mendelsohn maneuver training under laryngeal palpation
- **Secretions Management**:
  - Scheduled mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) every 4 hours
  - Daily oropharyngeal suctioning protocol

### B. Respiratory Rehabilitation
- **Muscle Training**:
  - Threshold IMT starting at 30% MIP (5 sets of 5 breaths, 3x/day)
  - Expiratory muscle training at 50% MEP (10 reps, 4x/day)
- **Airway Clearance**:
  - Active cycle breathing techniques with FET
  - Postural drainage with percussion 2x/day
- **Speaking Valve Protocol**:
  - Progressive tolerance training (start 5min 4x/day, increase 5min daily)
  - Passy-Muir valve application during all waking hours

### C. Nutritional & Medical Management
- **Enteral Nutrition**:
  - High-protein formula (1.5g/kg/day) with calorie-dense supplementation
  - Continuous nocturnal feeding (18hr) with daytime bolus hydration
- **Medical Optimization**:
  - Albumin infusion to correct hypoproteinemia
  - Iron supplementation for anemia
  - Mucolytic agents (acetylcysteine nebulization 3x/day)

### D. Communication & Psychosocial Support
- **Alternative Communication**:
  - Electrolarynx training with speech therapist 3x/week
  - Picture communication board implementation
- **Anxiety Management**:
  - Relaxation breathing exercises 3x/day
  - Referral to clinical psychology for CBT

### E. Monitoring Protocol
- Weekly RSST and PEFR measurements
- Biweekly cervical range of motion assessment
- Monthly VFSS reassessment (starting 8 weeks post-initiation)
- Daily SpO₂ monitoring during swallowing trials
- Weekly tracheostomy stoma inspection
