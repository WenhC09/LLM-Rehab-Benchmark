# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4-8 weeks):- Improve airway clearance to reduce aspiration risk and prevent recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
- Enhance swallowing safety by reducing Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) score from Level 8 to Level 6 or lower with modified textures.
- Increase diaphragm excursion during quiet breathing from 0.6 cm to 1.0 cm and during deep breathing from 2.32 cm to 3.0 cm.
- Improve suprahyoid muscle strength, targeting a% increase in sEMG amplitude.
- Achieve tolerance of speaking for 60 minutes/session without desaturation.
- Maintain arterial oxygen saturation ≥95% without supplemental oxygen for 4 hours/day.
- Improve nutritional status, targeting a 2-3 kg weight gain and serum protein ≥35 g/L.

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve safe oral intake with moderately thick liquids and soft solids without aspiration (PAS ≤4).
- Remove nasogastric tube with sustained nutritional improvement (BMI ≥22).
- Restore pulmonary function to FVC ≥2.0 L, FEV₁ ≥1.8 L, and MEP ≥60 cmH₂O.
- Achieve independent or modified independent status in basic Activities of Daily Living (ADL score ≥80).
- Prevent recurrence of aspiration pneumonia through sustained airway clearance and cough strength (SCSS score ≥5).
- Optimize upper esophageal sphincter (UES) function, targeting UES residual pressure ≤30 mmHg and relaxation duration ≥500 ms bilaterally.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Swallowing Rehabilitation- **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**: Apply NMES to suprahyoid muscles (digastric, mylohyoid) 5 days/week 30 minutes/session, at 80 Hz, 200 µs pulse width, intensity titrated to patient tolerance. Goal: Enhance suprahyoid muscle strength and hyoid elevation (<2 cm currently).
- **Mendelsohn Maneuver Training**: Supervised practice, 10 repetitions x 3 sets, 5 days/week. Patient instructed to hold hyoid elevation for 2-3 seconds during swallow to improve UES opening (currently incomplete, with increased residual pressure: 35.6 mmHg left, 55.4 mmHg right).
- **Effortful Swallow Training**: 10 repetitions x 3 sets, 5 days/week, focusing on strong tongue base retraction and pharyngeal contraction to reduce residue (Pyriform Sinus Residue Scale Grade 2) and silent aspiration (PAS Level 8).
- **Compensatory Maneuvers**: Train head-turn (left and right) and chin-tuck techniques during swallowing trials to reduce pharyngeal residue and aspiration risk. Practice 10 repetitions x 2 sets daily with 3 mL moderately thick liquids under supervision.
- **Thermal-Tactile Stimulation**: Apply cold stimulation to anterior faucial pillars 10 times/session, 5 days/week, to enhance pharyngeal sensation (currently near-absent) and trigger swallowing reflex.
- **Volume-Viscosity Swallow Training**: Gradual introduction of 3-5 mL moderately thick liquids (Type 3) under FEES guidance, 3 sessions/week. Progress to soft solids if PAS score improves to ≤6. Avoid thin liquids due to severe aspiration risk.
- **Oral Motor Exercises**: Lip, tongue, and cheek strengthening exercises (e.g., puckering, tongue protrusion, resistance presses), 10 repetitions x 3 sets daily, to improve oral bolus control and chewing endurance.

### Respiratory and Airway Clearance
- **Airway Clearance Techniques**: Active Cycle of Breathing (ACBT) and autogenic drainage, 15 minutes/session, 3 times/day, to mobilize thick yellow sputum and improve airway clearance (SCSS score: 3).
- **Manual Chest Physiotherapy**: Percussion and postural drainage, 10 minutes/session, 2 times/day, targeting lower lobes to address bronchiectasis and reduced thoracic excursion (upper lobe: ↓3 cm, middle lobe: ↓2 cm, lower lobe: ↓2.5 cm).
- **Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT)**: Use threshold device at 30% of MEP (43 cmH₂O), 10 minutes/session, 2 times/day, 5 days/week, to improve inspiratory strength and diaphragm excursion (0.6 cm quiet, 2.32 cm deep breathing).
- **Cough Assist Training**: Manual cough assist with abdominal thrust, 5 repetitions x 3 sets daily, to enhance cough strength (currently Grade 4) and airway clearance.
- **Speaking Valve Training**: Progressive use of Passy-Muir valve, starting at 30 minutes/session, increasing by 10 minutes weekly as tolerated, to improve vocalization and airway protection while maintaining SpO₂ ≥95%.
- **Supplemental Oxygen Management**: Titrate oxygen to maintain SpO₂ ≥95% during activities, with goal of weaning to room air for 4 hours/day within 6 weeks.

### Pulmonary Function Rehabilitation
- **Diaphragmatic Breathing Exercises**: 10 minutes/session, 3 times/day, in semi-reclined position to enhance diaphragm excursion and reduce restrictive ventilatory defect (FVC: 1.692 L, FEV₁: 1.443 L).
- **Pursed-Lip Breathing**: 5 minutes/session, 3 times/day, to improve expiratory flow (PEF: 2.530 L/s, MMEF: 1.834 L/s) and reduce dyspnea.
- **Incentive Spirometry**: 10 breaths x 3 sets, 3 times/day, targeting inspiratory volume increase to improve FVC and FEV₁.
- **Upper Limb and Thoracic Mobility Exercises**: Gentle shoulder shrugs, arm circles, and thoracic rotation, 10 repetitions x 2 sets daily, to enhance thoracic excursion and chest wall mobility.

### Nutritional Support
- **Enteral Nutrition Optimization**: Collaborate with dietitian to provide high-protein, high-calorie nasogastric tube feeding (target: 30 kcal/kg/day, 1.5 g/kg protein) to address nutritional risk (NRS-2002 score: 3, serum protein: 30 g/L, BMI: 19.6).
- **Monitor Weight and Labs**: Weekly weight checks and biweekly serum protein levels to track progress toward 2-3 kg weight gain and serum protein ≥35 g/L.
- **Oral Hygiene Protocol**: Rigorous oral care using Modified Beck Oral Assessment Scale (MBOAS score: 9), 4 times/day, to reduce oral secretions and infection risk.

### Functional and ADL Training
- **Bedside Mobility Training**: Progressive sitting balance and bed-to-chair transfers, 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, to improve ADL score (currently 55) and reduce fall risk (Morse score: 35).
- **Upper Extremity Strengthening**: Resistance exercises with 1-2 kg weights, 10 repetitions x 2 sets daily, to support self-care tasks.
- **Positioning**: Elevate head of bed 30-45° during feeding and rest to minimize aspiration risk and improve respiratory mechanics.

### Monitoring and Safety
- **Aspiration Pneumonia Prevention**: Monitor for fever, WBC, and CRP weekly (current: WBC 11.59 × 10⁹/L, CRP 51 mg/L) to detect early signs of infection.
- **Tracheostomy Care**: Daily cleaning and suctioning as needed to manage copious secretions and maintain airway patency.
- **Multidisciplinary Coordination**: Weekly reviews with pulmonologist, speech-language pathologist, dietitian, and neurologist to adjust plan based on progress in swallowing, respiratory, and nutritional status.
- **Patient and Family Education**: Train family on aspiration precautions, oral hygiene, and positioning to support home management and reduce caregiver burden.

### Frequency and Duration
- Daily therapy sessions (60-90 minutes total), 5-6 days/week, for 8 weeks, with reassessment via FEES, VFSS, and pulmonary function tests at 4 and 8 weeks to evaluate progress and adjust interventions.
