# **1. Rehabilitation Goals**

## **Short-term Goals:**
Stabilize vital signs. Effectively manage the airway via tracheostomy to reduce aspiration pneumonia and hypoxemia caused by persistent silent aspiration. Improve nutritional status, immunity, and physical endurance through precise nutritional support and basic physical training, laying the foundation for subsequent higher-intensity rehabilitation.

## **Long-term Goals:**
Improve swallowing function, specifically enhancing pharyngeal sensation, strengthening airway protective mechanisms, and promoting cricopharyngeal opening to reduce and ultimately eliminate aspiration. Strengthen respiratory muscle strength and cough efficiency to improve pulmonary function. **Ultimate Goal:** Decannulation and removal of nasogastric tube to achieve safe oral intake, enhancing Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and quality of life.

# **2. Treatment Methods**

## **(1) Nutritional Intervention**
Due to gastroesophageal reflux risk, a nasojejunal tube was successfully placed under fiberoptic bronchoscopy guidance for enteral feeding. A precise nutritional regimen was formulated based on assessment: total daily caloric intake ~1850kcal, total fluid intake 1800mL. Nutrison (Standard), Ensure (Standard), etc., are administered via pump infusion at scheduled intervals. Nutrison Fibre 500mL is continuously infused overnight via feeding pump to ensure adequate energy and hydration. The head of the bed remains elevated at 30° to prevent reflux.

## **(2) Physical and Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation**
*   **Endurance Training:** To address oxygen desaturation during training due to physical weakness, sessions are conducted under continuous ECG monitoring and invasive ventilator (Pressure Support Ventilation - PSV mode) assistance. Exercise prescription includes cycle ergometry and VR-based training at low-to-moderate intensity, heart rate controlled at 109-127 bpm, duration 20-30 minutes per session, twice daily.
*   **Respiratory Function Training:**
    *   **Breathing Coordination & Strength Training:** Instruct patient in diaphragmatic breathing using a speaking valve under respiratory monitoring feedback to improve respiratory control.
    *   **Airway Clearance Techniques:** Implement Active Cycle of Breathing Technique (ACBT) and Oscillatory Positive Expiratory Pressure (OPEP) therapy to mobilize and expectorate deep airway secretions.
    *   **Cough Function Training:** Train patient in effective cough techniques. Utilize Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation (MIE) to augment cough strength and clear secretions by simulating physiological cough mechanics.
    *   **ADL Endurance Training:** Perform daily activities while wearing the ventilator to increase tidal volume and reduce pulmonary infection risk.

## **(3) Swallowing Function Rehabilitation**
*   **Oral & Pharyngeal Muscle Training:**
    *   **Oral Motor Exercises:** Implement 9-point lingual pressure resistance training using electromyographic biofeedback and transoral neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to enhance tongue strength and mobility. Perform Masako Maneuver (tongue-hold swallow) to strengthen pharyngeal constrictors. Conduct active phonation of /i/ sound using speaking valve to promote vocal fold adduction.
    *   **Airway Protection Training:** Train patient in Supraglottic Swallow, Super-Supraglottic Swallow, and Mendelsohn maneuvers. Combine with VitalStim NMES therapy using audiovisual biofeedback to reinforce airway protection during swallowing and reduce aspiration.
*   **Trifaceted Sensory Facilitation Program:**
    *   **Central Level (rTMS):** Apply repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) to the parietal sensory cortex, once daily for 10 minutes, to activate cortical function.
    *   **Peripheral Level (Electrical & Gas Stimulation):** ① Administer transcutaneous Cervical Vagus Nerve Stimulation (tcVNS) daily for 30 minutes to improve pharyngeal sensation. ② Deliver subglottic oxygen (3L/min) via tracheostomy tube daily for 30 minutes for direct laryngopharyngeal stimulation. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) confirms combined central-peripheral stimulation more effectively activates relevant brain regions than peripheral stimulation alone.
*   **Precision Management of Cricopharyngeal Dysfunction:**
    *   **Diagnostic Therapy:** Perform catheter balloon dilatation under endoscopic guidance to assess cricopharyngeal function. Conduct active dilatation via precise balloon placement and inflation (2-3.5mL water), once daily.
    *   **Botulinum Toxin Injection:** Following confirmation of cricopharyngeal achalasia (incomplete relaxation) via pharyngeal manometry, administer OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox 50U) injection into the cricopharyngeus muscle under combined ultrasound, EMG, and balloon guidance. Aims to reduce resting and residual pressures, promoting upper esophageal sphincter opening.
