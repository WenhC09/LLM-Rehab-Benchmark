# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

### 1. Rehabilitation Goals

#### Short-term goals (4-6 weeks):
*   **Pulmonary Safety:** Prevent further aspiration pneumonia by maintaining strict NPO status and improving airway clearance.
*   **Respiratory Function:** Enhance respiratory muscle strength, targeting an increase in Maximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP) by 20%. Improve effective cough strength from SCSS Grade 3 to Grade 2. Increase tolerance of Passy-Muir Speaking Valve (PMV) to >1 hour per session, twice daily.
*   **Swallowing Function:** Re-establish pharyngeal sensory awareness and elicit a voluntary cough reflex. Improve laryngeal elevation and suprahyoid muscle contraction strength, measurable via sEMG biofeedback. Achieve effective clearance of saliva with compensatory strategies.
*   **Nutritional Status:** Correct hypoproteinemia and achieve a stable body weight through optimized nasogastric feeding.
*   **General Function:** Achieve independent sitting balance for at least 30 minutes. Improve oral hygiene to an MBOAS score of ≤ 5.

#### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
*   **Respiratory Independence:** Achieve successful decannulation of the tracheostomy tube and maintain SpO₂ >94% on room air.
*   **Swallowing Function:** Re-introduce oral intake with a modified diet (starting with puree consistency, IDDSI Level 4) for nutritional supplementation, confirmed safe by repeat VFSS/FEES with a PAS score of ≤ 2.
*   **Functional Independence:** Progress from complete dependence to modified independence in bed mobility and transfers.

### 2. Treatment Methods

A multidisciplinary, intensive rehabilitation approach is required, focusing on the following areas:

#### A. Swallowing Rehabilitation (Strictly NPO)
1.  **Sensory Re-education (to address sensory deficits and silent aspiration):**
    *   **Thermal-Tactile Stimulation (TTS):** Application of a cold laryngeal mirror to the anterior faucial arches prior to swallowing exercises to heighten sensory input and prime the swallowing reflex. (Twice daily)
    *   **Targeted Pharyngeal Stimulation:** Under endoscopic guidance (FEES), provide light air-pulse or tactile stimulation to the pharyngeal walls and epiglottis to attempt to restore sensation and protective reflexes.
2.  **Motor Strengthening and Coordination Training:**
    *   **Suprahyoid Muscle Strengthening:**
        *   **Chin Tuck Against Resistance (CTAR):** As a safer alternative to the Shaker exercise given the patient's occipitocervical fusion. (10 repetitions, 3 sets, twice daily)
        *   **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES):** Surface electrode placement on the submental region to augment CTAR and volitional swallowing exercises. (30 minutes, daily)
    *   **Laryngeal and Pharyngeal Function:**
        *   **Mendelsohn Maneuver:** Practice with saliva swallows to improve and prolong laryngeal elevation and UES opening. Utilize sEMG for biofeedback to ensure correct execution and track progress. (10 repetitions, 3 sets, twice daily)
        *   **Effortful Swallow:** To increase tongue base retraction and pharyngeal pressure on the bolus (saliva). (10 repetitions, 3 sets, twice daily)
        *   **Super-supraglottic Swallow:** To improve volitional airway closure, practiced with saliva swallows to compensate for bilateral vocal cord paralysis. (5 repetitions, 3 sets, twice daily)
3.  **Biofeedback Training:**
    *   **FEES-based Biofeedback:** Provide the patient with real-time visual feedback of pharyngeal/laryngeal structures. Use this to guide attempts at improved vocal cord adduction, residue clearance with head-turn, and the effectiveness of the super-supraglottic swallow.
    *   **sEMG Biofeedback:** Provide visual feedback on the intensity and duration of suprahyoid muscle contraction during the Mendelsohn and effortful swallow maneuvers.

#### B. Respiratory Rehabilitation
1.  **Respiratory Muscle Training (RMT):**
    *   **Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT):** Use a threshold pressure device, starting at 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure, to improve diaphragmatic and inspiratory muscle strength. (30 breaths, twice daily)
    *   **Expiratory Muscle Training (EMT):** Use a threshold pressure device, starting at 30% of MEP, to improve expiratory muscle force for a more effective cough. (30 breaths, twice daily)
2.  **Airway Clearance Techniques:**
    *   **Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation (CoughAssist):** To non-invasively remove tracheobronchial secretions, especially upon waking and before/after PMV use. (3-5 cycles per session, as needed)
    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing Exercises:** With manual cues and ultrasound biofeedback to improve diaphragmatic excursion and restore efficient breathing patterns.
3.  **Tracheostomy Weaning Protocol:**
    *   **Cuff Deflation Trials:** Systematically increase the duration of cuff deflation, monitoring for signs of respiratory distress or aspiration of secretions.
    *   **Passy-Muir Valve (PMV) Application:** Gradually increase wearing time. The PMV will help restore pharyngeal pressure during swallowing, improve sensory feedback, and facilitate verbal communication.

#### C. Nutritional Management
1.  **Dietitian Consultation:** Immediate consultation for formulation of a high-protein, high-calorie enteral feeding regimen to address the NRS-2002 score of 3 and promote anabolism.
2.  **Monitoring:** Weekly monitoring of weight, serum albumin, and prealbumin levels to titrate nutritional support.

#### D. Physical & Occupational Therapy
1.  **General Conditioning:**
    *   Progressive mobility program: Bed exercises, sitting balance training (supported to unsupported), and preparatory exercises for standing transfers.
    *   Range of motion exercises for all limbs to prevent contractures.
2.  **Oral Care Program:**
    *   Meticulous oral hygiene performed by nursing staff 3-4 times daily (brushing, suctioning, non-alcohol-based antiseptic rinse) to reduce the bacterial load in oral secretions, thereby minimizing the risk of pneumonia if aspiration occurs.
3.  **Patient and Family Education:**
    *   Extensive education on the rationale for NPO, aspiration precautions, and the importance of active participation in the rehabilitation program. Instruction on recognizing signs of respiratory distress.
