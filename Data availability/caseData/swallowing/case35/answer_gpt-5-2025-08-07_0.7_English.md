# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (within 2–4 weeks)
1. Maintain adequate airway patency and oxygenation, preventing acute respiratory compromise.
2. Reduce risk of aspiration pneumonia through strict aspiration precautions and compensatory swallowing strategies.
3. Improve airway clearance ability by enhancing cough strength and secretion management.
4. Begin targeted oropharyngeal and suprahyoid muscle strengthening to improve swallowing safety.
5. Optimize nutritional status via safe enteral feeding and nutritional supplementation.
6. Improve sitting tolerance and trunk stability to facilitate safe swallowing posture.
7. Educate patient and caregivers on safe feeding practices, secretion management, and tracheostomy care.

### Long-term goals (within 3–6 months)
1. Achieve maximal safe oral intake with minimal aspiration risk; reduce dependence on nasogastric tube.
2. Improve pharyngeal phase swallowing function, including tongue base retraction, pharyngeal wall contraction, and hyoid elevation.
3. Enhance UES relaxation and opening through targeted therapy and possibly adjunctive modalities.
4. Increase pulmonary function and thoracic excursion to support stronger cough and airway protection.
5. Achieve functional independence in basic ADLs appropriate to neurological and structural limitations.
6. Prevent recurrent pneumonia, maintain stable oxygenation without supplemental oxygen during daytime.
7. Improve overall endurance, muscle strength, and nutritional status.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Airway and Respiratory Management
- **Airway clearance techniques**: 
  - Manual assisted cough training.
  - Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) if available.
  - Regular suctioning of oral and tracheal secretions.
- **Breathing exercises**: 
  - Diaphragmatic breathing with visual feedback.
  - Segmental breathing exercises to improve thoracic excursion.
- **Respiratory muscle training**:
  - Inspiratory muscle training (threshold device, starting low and progressing cautiously).
  - Expiratory muscle training to improve cough peak flow.
- **Speaking valve training**:
  - Gradual increase in duration to improve subglottic pressure and laryngeal sensation.
- **Infection control**:
  - Strict oral hygiene protocol.
  - Humidification of inspired air to reduce secretion viscosity.

### B. Swallowing Rehabilitation
- **Compensatory strategies** (during any therapeutic swallow trials only under therapist supervision):
  - Chin tuck, head turn to stronger side.
  - Multiple effortful swallows to clear residue.
  - Supraglottic swallow maneuver (modified as tolerated given absent cough reflex).
- **Direct swallowing therapy**:
  - Initiate with therapeutic consistencies under FEES guidance; start from high-viscosity bolus in minimal volume.
  - Monitor for silent aspiration closely.
- **Indirect swallowing therapy** (no bolus):
  - Effortful swallow exercises.
  - Mendelsohn maneuver to improve hyolaryngeal elevation and UES opening.
  - Masako maneuver to strengthen tongue base to pharyngeal wall contact.
- **Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)**:
  - Consider targeting suprahyoid muscles for contraction enhancement (monitor parameters carefully due to surgical history).
- **Sensory stimulation**:
  - Thermal-tactile stimulation to faucial pillars and pharyngeal walls to facilitate swallow reflex.

### C. Upper Esophageal Sphincter Dysfunction Management
- Shaker exercise or chin tuck against resistance (CTAR) to strengthen suprahyoid muscles and promote UES opening.
- Balloon dilatation or botulinum toxin injection to cricopharyngeus — to be considered after multidisciplinary reevaluation if conservative therapy fails.

### D. Nutritional Support
- Continue nasogastric tube feeding to meet caloric and protein needs.
- Engage dietitian for high-protein, high-calorie formula; adjust for BMI recovery.
- Monitor weight, serum albumin, and prealbumin weekly.
- Gradual oral intake introduction only after instrumental swallow reassessment shows improved safety.

### E. Physical Therapy and General Conditioning
- Passive and active-assisted limb ROM to prevent contractures.
- Gradual mobilization to sitting and standing as tolerated to improve endurance.
- Trunk control and balance training to optimize posture for swallowing.

### F. Speech and Communication
- Voice therapy as tolerated with speaking valve to maximize residual phonatory function.
- Articulation exercises to maintain oral motor skills.

### G. Patient and Caregiver Education
- Training in secretion management, safe feeding techniques, positioning, and signs of aspiration.
- Emergency response training for airway obstruction or respiratory distress.

### H. Monitoring and Reassessment
- Weekly reassessment of swallowing function with FEES or VFSS to adjust therapy intensity and bolus trials.
- Pulmonary function reassessment every 4–6 weeks.
- Nutritional and functional status monitored biweekly.

**Precautions**:
- No unsupervised oral intake until instrumental assessment confirms safe swallow.
- Maintain upright position ≥30 minutes after any feeding.
- Avoid fatigue during therapy sessions; monitor oxygen saturation continuously during interventions.
- Watch for signs of respiratory distress or aspiration during any therapy.
