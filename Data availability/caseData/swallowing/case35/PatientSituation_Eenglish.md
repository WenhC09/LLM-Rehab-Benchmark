# Medical Record Summary

Male patient, 38 years old, transferred to our hospital on May 24, 2023.

*   **Chief Complaint**: Recurrent dysphagia and fever for over 3 months, shortness of breath for 1 week.
*   **Present Illness**: On January 27, 2023, the patient experienced sudden paroxysmal convulsions and apnea overnight. External hospital cranial MRI indicated Basilar Invagination with Atlanto-occipital Assimilation and Cerebellar Tonsillar Herniation into the spinal canal. The external hospital attributed this to cerebral hypoxia from sleep apnea and cranial nerve compression due to Basilar Invagination. Symptoms persisted despite ventilator-assisted therapy. Laryngoscopy revealed bilateral vocal cord paralysis. On February 14, 2023, the patient underwent "Tracheostomy + Endoscopic-assisted Laryngoscopic Laryngeal Stenosis Dilation (Right Arytenoid Cartilage Plasma Ablation Excision)". Postoperatively, the patient retained a tracheostomy tube and nasogastric tube. The tracheostomy tube was removed on March 13, 2023. On April 2, 2023, the patient underwent "Partial Cerebellar Tonsillectomy + Occipitocervical Decompression + Occipitocervical Fusion". However, the nasogastric tube could not be removed. The patient continued to experience dysphagia, recurrent fever, and persistent hypoxemia. The patient and family requested improvement in swallowing function and reduction of aspiration.
*   **Past Medical History**: Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS), Hypertension, Bronchiectasis, Epilepsy, Sinus Tachycardia.
*   **Clinical Diagnosis**:
    1.  Aspiration Pneumonia
    2.  Respiratory Failure
    3.  Postoperative Status: Basilar Invagination Surgery
    4.  Postoperative Status: Right Arytenoid Cartilage Excision
    5.  Congenital Atlanto-occipital Malformation
    6.  Sleep Apnea
    7.  Bilateral Vocal Cord Paralysis
    8.  Hypertension Stage 3 (Very High-Risk Group)
    9.  Secondary Epilepsy
    10. Sinus Tachycardia
    11. Bronchiectasis
*   **Functional Diagnosis**:
    1.  Dysphagia
    2.  Decreased Pulmonary Function
    3.  Complete Dependence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL)

# Pre-Rehabilitation Quantitative Examinations

## Phase I Assessment (Admission Night)

On the night of admission to the Rehabilitation Department, the patient developed shortness of breath, dyspnea, oxygen saturation persistently <70%, respiratory rate >30 breaths/min, profuse sweating, and Three Depression Sign (tracheal tug).

*   **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)**: PaCO₂ 50.1 mmHg, PaO₂ 39.6 mmHg.
*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: WBC 11.59 × 10⁹/L, Neutrophil Percentage 85.4%. C-reactive Protein (CRP) 51 mg/L.
*   **Swallowing Function Examination**: Critically ill with severe aspiration. Laryngoscopy revealed: Persistent leakage and aspiration following arytenoid cartilage excision. Bilateral vocal cord paralysis, near-absent pharyngeal sensation, absent cough reflex, and poor airway clearance. Oral intake assessment was deferred for safety. Fiberoptic Bronchoscopy (FOB) showed copious thick yellow sputum in the airway.

## Phase II Assessment (Post-Tracheostomy)

### 1. Nutritional Assessment
Poor physical endurance. Weight loss of 29 kg compared to pre-illness state. BMI 19.6 (previous 30.7). Long-term nasogastric tube feeding. Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) score: 3. Serum protein: 30 g/L. Nutritional risk present.

### 2. Nursing Assessment
Modified Beck Oral Assessment Scale (MBOAS) score: 9. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score: 55. Morse Fall Scale (MORSE) score: 35. Repetitive Saliva Swallowing Test (RSST): Failed. Water Swallowing Test: Not performed.

### 3. Swallowing Function Assessment
*   **(1) Clinical Assessment**: Normal cervical range of motion. Lip and tongue range of motion adequate, but strength and endurance decreased. Increased oral secretions, decreased chewing endurance. Diminished voluntary throat clearing. Absent gag reflex, vomiting reflex, and cough reflex. Hyoid elevation <2 cm. RSST: 3 times/30 seconds. No other significant abnormalities in orofacial or laryngeal function. Water Swallowing Test Grade 5. Volume-Viscosity Swallow Test (V-VST) results: Significant impaired safety observed with both 3mL of Type 2 (slightly thick) and Type 3 (moderately thick) foods.
*   **(2) Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES)**: Left arytenoid cartilage excised. Severe secretions present in bilateral valleculae, pyriform sinuses, and laryngeal vestibule. Voluntary swallowing present, but reduced tongue base retraction, pharyngeal wall contraction, and bilateral vocal cord adduction/abduction. No response to light touch on right arytenoid cartilage and epiglottis. Pyriform Sinus Secretion Scale (PSS) Grade 4. With 3mL moderately thick food: Mild bilateral pharyngeal residue (Pyriform Sinus Residue Scale Grade 2), Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) Level 8. Indicates severe silent aspiration and pharyngeal phase dysphagia.
*   **(3) Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS)**: Consumed high-viscosity barium (3mL) and iohexol (3mL) in natural sitting position. Findings: Good head and oral control. Adequate bolus transit. Slightly delayed swallowing initiation. No nasopharyngeal reflux. Mild bilateral residue in valleculae and pyriform sinuses; partially cleared with multiple swallows, head turn left, and head turn right maneuvers. Severe silent aspiration observed with both consistencies. Absent cough reflex. PAS Level 8. Partial clearance achieved with prompting. Cricopharyngeal muscle opening occasional and incomplete. Conclusions: ① Dysphagia (Pharyngeal Phase); ② Silent Aspiration; ③ Incomplete Cricopharyngeal Opening.

### 4. Respiratory Function Assessment
Tracheostomy in situ. Copious oral secretions, self-expectorated. Sputum present: thick, yellow, partially self-expectorated with weak functional cough. Secretion Clearance and Cough Strength (SCSS) score: 3. Normal respiratory pattern and chest wall shape. Respiratory rate: 19 breaths/min. Tolerated cuff deflation trial for extended periods. Tolerated speaking valve for 30 minutes/session. Arterial oxygen saturation maintained at 95%-99% with supplemental oxygen.

### 5. Pulmonary Function Assessment
Significantly reduced thoracic excursion. With forced breathing: Upper lobe excursion ↓3cm, Middle lobe ↓2cm, Lower lobe ↓2.5cm. Voluntary cough strength: Grade 4. Objective pulmonary function parameters uniformly decreased: FVC ↓1.692L, PEF ↓2.530 L/s, FEV₁ ↓1.443L, Maximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP) ↓43 cmH₂O, Forced Expiratory Flow (FEF) 25% [V₂₅] ↓2.243 L/s, FEF 50% [V₅₀] ↓1.915 L/s, Maximal Mid-Expiratory Flow (MMEF) ↓1.834 L/s. FEV₁/FVC: 85.3%. Suggests restrictive ventilatory defect.

### 6. Diaphragm Ultrasound Assessment
Reduced diaphragm excursion and contractility. Diaphragm excursion during quiet breathing: 0.6cm. Diaphragm excursion during deep breathing: 2.32cm.

### 7. Suprahyoid Muscle Electromyography (sEMG)
sEMG showed decreased amplitude in suprahyoid muscles, indicating mildly weakened muscle contraction. Conclusion: Reduced strength in suprahyoid muscles.

### 8. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)
Comparison of brain region activation maps during saliva swallowing task state versus resting state revealed decreased activation in bilateral parietal sensory areas.

### 9. Pharyngeal Manometry
Results: Increased Upper Esophageal Sphincter (UES) Residual Pressure and shortened Relaxation Duration, more pronounced on the right side.
*   **Left Side**: UES Resting Pressure 40.3 mmHg; UES Residual Pressure 35.6 mmHg (Increased); Relaxation Duration 420 ms (Shortened).
*   **Right Side**: UES Resting Pressure 47.1 mmHg; UES Residual Pressure 55.4 mmHg (Increased); Relaxation Duration 105 ms (Shortened).
