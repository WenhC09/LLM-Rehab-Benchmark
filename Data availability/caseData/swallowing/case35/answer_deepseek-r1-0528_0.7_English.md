# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals
### Short-term goals (0-4 weeks):
- Achieve safe secretion management with tracheostomy cuff deflation ≥8 hours/day
- Reduce aspiration risk to PAS ≤6 during swallowing trials
- Improve voluntary cough strength to SCSS ≥5
- Increase diaphragmatic excursion to ≥1.5cm during quiet breathing
- Maintain oxygen saturation >92% during therapy sessions
- Prevent further weight loss (target BMI ≥20)

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
- Achieve complete tracheostomy decannulation
- Establish safe oral intake of IDDSI Level 4 puree textures
- Restore functional cough reflex (SCSS ≥8)
- Improve pulmonary function to FVC ≥50% predicted
- Achieve modified independence in basic ADLs (ADL score ≥85)

## 2. Treatment Methods
### Swallowing Rehabilitation
- **Airway Protection Training**  
  - Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) every 4 hours  
  - Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) starting at 50% MEP  
  - Voluntary cough training with visual biofeedback  
- **Pharyngeal Phase Rehabilitation**  
  - Thermal-tactile stimulation to improve pharyngeal sensitivity  
  - Effortful swallow exercises with sEMG biofeedback  
  - Mendelsohn maneuver training for UES opening  
  - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to suprahyoid muscles  
- **Compensatory Strategies**  
  - Strict NPO status with continued NG feeding  
  - Chin tuck during saliva swallows  
  - Daily secretion management protocol  

### Respiratory Rehabilitation
- **Ventilatory Muscle Training**  
  - Threshold IMT starting at 30% MIP  
  - Diaphragmatic re-education with ultrasound biofeedback  
  - Incentive spirometry with breath-holding exercises  
- **Airway Clearance Techniques**  
  - Active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) hourly  
  - Oscillatory PEP therapy with Aerobika device  
  - Manual rib springing for chest wall mobility  
- **Oxygenation Management**  
  - Progressive speaking valve trials (target 4hrs/day)  
  - Prone positioning protocol 2hrs BID  
  - Controlled breathing retraining (pursed-lip breathing)  

### Physical Rehabilitation
- **Mobility Training**  
  - Bed-level active range of motion exercises BID  
  - Progressive sitting tolerance training  
  - Supported standing with tilt table  
- **Strength Training**  
  - Cervical stabilization exercises  
  - Scapular strengthening with resistance bands  
  - Core activation in supine position  

### Nutritional & Medical Management
- **Nutritional Support**  
  - High-protein enteral formula (1.5g/kg/day)  
  - Micronutrient supplementation (zinc, vitamin C)  
  - Daily weight monitoring  
- **Medical Coordination**  
  - Daily sputum culture surveillance  
  - Bronchodilator optimization for bronchiectasis  
  - Strict BP monitoring during therapy sessions
