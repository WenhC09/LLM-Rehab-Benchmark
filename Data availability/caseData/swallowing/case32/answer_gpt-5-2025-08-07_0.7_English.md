# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2–4 weeks):
1. Maintain airway safety and prevent aspiration pneumonia through strict swallowing precautions and secretion management.
2. Optimize nutritional status via safe enteral feeding and prevention of further weight loss.
3. Prevent further muscle atrophy and joint contractures through passive and assisted range-of-motion (ROM) exercises.
4. Improve cardiopulmonary endurance to tolerate rehabilitation training.
5. Enhance head and neck control to support future swallowing recovery.
6. Maintain and stimulate oropharyngeal sensory and motor function despite inability for oral feeding.
7. Prevent pressure injuries and other complications of immobilization.

### Long-term goals (3–6 months or longer):
1. Achieve partial recovery of swallowing function to allow safe oral intake of selected consistencies, depending on cricopharyngeal function recovery.
2. Improve limb muscle strength to at least Grade 4 for independence or minimal assistance in ADLs.
3. Restore effective phonation for functional communication.
4. Improve balance for safe sitting and, if possible, standing and ambulation with aids.
5. Achieve cardiopulmonary function sufficient for daily activities without significant fatigue.
6. Maximize independence and quality of life, and reduce care burden on family.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Dysphagia Management
- **NPO (nil per os)**: Continue nasogastric tube feeding as per nutritional plan; no oral trials until safe swallow is observed.
- **Oral hygiene**: Meticulous oral care 3–4 times daily to reduce aspiration risk from bacterial colonization.
- **Secretion management**: Regular suctioning; position changes; chest physiotherapy as tolerated.
- **Indirect swallowing therapy**:
  - Thermal-tactile stimulation to anterior faucial pillars to promote swallow reflex.
  - Laryngeal and pharyngeal sensory stimulation (ice massage, sour bolus trials without swallowing in mouth).
  - Isometric and isotonic orofacial exercises: lip closure, tongue elevation, lateralization, and resistance exercises.
  - Shaker exercise and/or chin tuck against resistance (CTAR) if neck strength allows, to target suprahyoid muscles.
  - Mendelsohn maneuver training (dry practice) to maintain neuromuscular patterning.
- **Cricopharyngeal dysfunction**: Monitor progress; if persistent and limiting recovery, consider referral for cricopharyngeal myotomy or botulinum toxin after adequate medical optimization.

### B. Nutritional Support
- Enteral feeding via NG tube with high-protein, high-calorie, easily digestible formula.
- Monitor weight, serum albumin, prealbumin weekly.
- Collaborate with dietitian to adjust caloric/protein intake to support muscle repair and immune function.

### C. Motor Function Rehabilitation
- **Bed mobility**: Passive ROM to all joints 2–3 times/day to prevent contractures.
- **Strength training**:
  - Begin with assisted active ROM progressing to active ROM.
  - Graduated resistance training with therabands or light weights as tolerated.
  - Focus on anti-gravity muscle groups: neck extensors/flexors, shoulder girdle, hip extensors.
- **Neuromuscular re-education**: Facilitate motor control with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) patterns.
- **Functional training**: Rolling, sitting balance, transfers with maximal-to-moderate assistance.

### D. Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation
- **Breathing exercises**: Diaphragmatic breathing, segmental breathing, pursed-lip breathing.
- **Incentive spirometry**: 5–10 breaths/session, multiple times/day if patient alert and cooperative.
- **Gradual mobilization**: Elevate head of bed, progress to dangling at bedside, sitting in chair as tolerated.
- **Airway clearance techniques**: Assisted coughing, chest percussion/vibration, mechanical insufflation-exsufflation if needed.

### E. Dysphonia Management
- Begin with gentle phonation and humming exercises within patient tolerance.
- Vocal hygiene education (adequate humidification, avoid throat clearing).
- Respiratory-phonation coordination training to increase maximum phonation time.

### F. Balance Training
- Initially work on static sitting balance with support.
- Progress to dynamic sitting activities (reaching, weight shifts).
- As lower extremity strength improves, initiate supported standing and pre-gait activities.

### G. ADL Training
- Engage in self-care tasks with maximal assistance, emphasizing participation to stimulate motor and cognitive function.
- Use adaptive equipment as needed for grooming, feeding (later), dressing.

### H. Complication Prevention
- Regular repositioning every 2 hours to prevent pressure ulcers.
- Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis per medical team’s protocol.
- Monitor for signs of recurrent pulmonary infection.

### I. Multidisciplinary Coordination
- **Medical management**: Continue immunosuppressive therapy for dermatomyositis, anti-infective treatment for pneumonia, and management of comorbidities.
- **Speech-language pathology**: Lead dysphagia and dysphonia rehabilitation.
- **Physical therapy**: Lead motor, balance, and cardiopulmonary training.
- **Occupational therapy**: Focus on ADL training and adaptive strategies.
- **Nutrition**: Optimize enteral feeding plan.
- **Nursing**: Implement safety precautions, monitor skin, assist with exercises.
