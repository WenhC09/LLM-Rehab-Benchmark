# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan  
*Based on assessment data as of July 10, 2020*

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals  
### Short-term Goals (4-6 weeks):  
- **Swallowing:** Achieve safe oral secretions management, reduce silent aspiration risk, initiate therapeutic swallow trials with thickened liquids  
- **Motor Function:** Improve neck control (achieve independent head lift in sitting), increase limb strength to 3+/5  
- **Respiration:** Increase maximum phonation time to 3 seconds, establish effective cough mechanism  
- **ADL:** Achieve partial participation in bed mobility with moderate assistance  
- **Nutrition:** Stabilize nutritional status via tube feeding with albumin >30g/L  

### Long-term Goals (3-6 months):  
- **Swallowing:** Transition to oral intake of pureed foods (FOIS ≥4), eliminate silent aspiration  
- **Motor Function:** Achieve independent sitting balance, ambulate 10m with walker  
- **Respiration:** Normalize breathing pattern, phonation time >8s  
- **ADL:** Perform basic self-care with minimal assistance (Modified Barthel Index ≥45)  
- **Medical Stability:** Resolve recurrent pneumonias, maintain dermatomyositis remission  

## 2. Treatment Methods  
### Dysphagia Management  
- **Compensatory Strategies:**  
  - Strict NPO status with continued NG tube feeding  
  - Chin tuck posture during secretion management  
  - Supraglottic swallow training with ice chips  
- **Direct Therapy:**  
  - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to suprahyoid muscles  
  - Shaker exercises for UES opening  
  - Thermal-tactile stimulation to trigger swallow reflex  
  - Lingual resistance training with IOPI device  
- **Airway Protection:**  
  - Mechanically assisted cough training  
  - Daily secretion clearance protocol (oral suctioning Q2h)  

### Motor Rehabilitation  
- **Strength Training:**  
  - Progressive resistance exercise for neck extensors (starting in sidelying)  
  - Closed-chain quadriceps strengthening (sit-to-stand with 50% body weight support)  
  - Scapular stabilization exercises  
- **Functional Mobility:**  
  - Bed mobility training (bridging, rolling) with assistive devices  
  - Supported sitting balance training (beginning at 30° elevation)  
  - Body weight-supported treadmill training (BWS-TT) at 20% support  

### Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation  
- **Breathing Retraining:**  
  - Diaphragmatic breathing with inspiratory muscle trainer (30% MIP)  
  - Paced ventilation techniques  
- **Aerobic Conditioning:**  
  - UBE (upper body ergometer) at 40% HRmax, 5min × 2/day  
  - Passive cycling with EMG biofeedback  

### Voice & Communication  
- **Phonation Therapy:**  
  - Effort closure techniques for glottal insufficiency  
  - Lee Silverman Voice Treatment LOUD (LSVT) modified for low intensity  
- **Augmentative Communication:**  
  - Eye-gaze communication board implementation  

### Comprehensive Care  
- **Nutritional Support:**  
  - Collaborative diet modification: High-protein NG formula (1.5g/kg/day)  
  - Vitamin D and calcium supplementation  
- **Skin Integrity Protocol:**  
  - Pressure relief rotation schedule (Q2h)  
  - Silicone dressings for Gottron's rash  
- **Paraneoplastic Monitoring:**  
  - Monthly tumor marker screening coordination with oncology  

### Safety Precautions  
- Continuous pulse oximetry during therapy  
- Aspiration precautions with emergency suction at bedside  
- Vital sign monitoring pre/post session (HR, SpO₂, RR)  
- Therapy intensity titration based on CRP levels (<20mg/L)  

*Treatment frequency: Swallowing therapy 5×/week, other modalities 3×/week. Re-evaluation scheduled at 4-week intervals with repeat VFSS when FOIS reaches Level 3.*
