# 1. Rehabilitation Goals

## **Short-Term Goals:**
*   Improve nutritional status, control and manage pulmonary infection, enhance cardiopulmonary function.
*   Increase muscle strength in all four limbs, maintain joint range of motion (ROM), prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
*   Improve oral sensory and motor function, elicit swallowing reflex, protect airway safety, reduce aspiration risk.
*   Alleviate patient's anxiety and depression, establish rehabilitation confidence.

## **Long-Term Goals:**
*   Restore safe and effective oral feeding ability, eliminate dependence on tube feeding, improve quality of life (QOL).
*   Restore vocal function, achieve clear phonation.
*   Restore motor function of all four limbs, balance function, and activities of daily living (ADL) ability, achieving functional independence.

# 2. Therapeutic Methods

The rehabilitation strategy for this case is based on collaborative teamwork (Medicine-Technical-Nursing) and is patient-centered, formulating a comprehensive rehabilitation plan as follows:

*   **Basic and Supportive Treatment:**
    1.  **Treatment of Primary Cause:** Physician administers immunosuppressants and corticosteroids targeting the underlying disease "Dermatomyositis".
    2.  **Symptomatic and Supportive Treatment:** Utilizes anti-infectives, expectorants, antitussives, supplemented by nebulized medication to control and reduce pulmonary infection. Performs fiberoptic bronchoscopy promptly when sputum drainage is inadequate.
    3.  **Nutritional Intervention:** Nutrition department formulates an individualized nutrition plan. Nursing team removes nasogastric tube and switches to Intermittent Oro-gastric (IOG) tube feeding enteral nutrition combined with intravenous parenteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition provides nutritional powder and water via IOG six times daily between 06:30 and 21:00. Parenteral nutrition supplements via intravenous infusion of compound amino acids and fat emulsion. Maintain patient at a 30°-60° position for 30 minutes post-feeding to prevent reflux.
    4.  **Nursing Intervention:** Enhances oral care to maintain cleanliness and reduce infection risk. Promotes sputum drainage via scheduled position changes with back percussion, prone positioning for postural drainage, suctioning as needed, and use of mechanical airway clearance devices.
    5.  **Psychological Intervention:** The Medicine-Technical-Nursing team provides psychological counseling to the patient and family throughout treatment to alleviate anxiety and depression and help build rehabilitation confidence.

*   **Functional Rehabilitation Training:**
    1.  **Motor and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Intervention:** Physical and occupational therapists utilize passive, active-assisted, and active exercises to maintain limb joint ROM, prevent muscle atrophy, improve muscle strength and endurance, thereby enhancing overall mobility.
    2.  **Cardiopulmonary Function Intervention:** Respiratory therapist employs airway clearance techniques to aid sputum expectoration, reduce airway obstruction, improve ventilation, combined with respiratory muscle training to enhance cardiopulmonary function.
    3.  **Vocal Function Intervention:** Enhances respiratory drive and addresses breathy voice and effortful phonation through breathing exercises (e.g., blowing whistles, blowing tissue paper - pursed-lip breathing) and "ah" phonation with palmar pressure.
    4.  **Swallowing Function Intervention:**
        *   **Oral Sensorimotor Training:** Uses ice swabs to stimulate posterior pharyngeal wall, soft palate, and tongue base to increase sensory input and elicit swallowing; utilizes tongue depressors for tongue traction to improve mobility and strength; employs chewable sticks for mastication training to improve mandibular control; applies air-pulse stimulation to posterior pharyngeal wall to accelerate swallow initiation; performs tongue pressure resistance training to increase intraoral pressure.
        *   **Head and Neck Control Training:** Guides patient in active resistance exercises for head and neck to enhance control and muscle strength.
        *   **Specific Swallowing Muscle Group Strengthening:**
            *   **Masako Maneuver (Tongue-Hold Swallow):** Instructs patient to swallow while holding the tongue tip protruded and fixed between teeth or a damp cloth to strengthen tongue base retraction and anterior movement of posterior pharyngeal wall.
            *   **Shaker Exercise (Head Lift Exercise):** Patient in supine position lifts head to look at toes (shoulders remain on bed) to strengthen suprahyoid muscles and promote upper esophageal sphincter (UES) opening.
            *   **Straw Sucking Training:** Instructs patient to suck forcefully on a straw and sustain suction to increase extent of tongue and laryngeal elevation.
        *   **Airway Protection Maneuver Training:**
            *   **Effortful Swallow:** Instructs patient to swallow with maximal effort to increase oropharyngeal pressure.
            *   **Supraglottic / Super-Supraglottic Swallow:** Trains patient to inhale, hold breath, swallow, then cough immediately after swallowing to enhance airway protection.
            *   **Mendelsohn Maneuver:** Trains patient to consciously feel and voluntarily prolong laryngeal elevation at its peak during swallowing to increase the width and duration of cricopharyngeal opening.
        *   **Respiratory Coordination Training:** Trains respiratory muscle strength and endurance via balloon blowing and use of respiratory trainers, combined with effective cough training to improve swallowing-respiratory coordination.
        *   **Neuromodulation Techniques:**
            *   **Peripheral Neuromodulation:** Applies Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) therapy daily for 20 minutes over neck and pharyngeal regions to promote neuromuscular contraction and enhance muscle strength.
            *   **Central Neuromodulation:** Administers Armeo Spring Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) therapy daily for 20 minutes. Protocol includes: 5Hz stimulation over healthy pharyngeal motor cortex (90% resting motor threshold (rMT), 500 pulses, daily for 14 days); 1Hz stimulation over suprahyoid motor area (120% rMT, 1200 pulses, daily for 5 days); 5Hz stimulation over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (100% rMT, 1200 pulses, daily for 5 days) to improve swallowing function and depressive state.
        *   **Acupuncture Therapy:** Applies scalp acupuncture targeting acupoints Fengchi (GB20), Yiming (Extra), Lianquan (CV23) to achieve effects of promoting meridian circulation and facilitating swallowing and phonation.
        *   **Therapeutic Feeding Training:** Upon improvement in swallowing function, initiates therapeutic feeding per McNeill Dysphagia Therapy Program. Begins with trialing green-dyed crushed ice, confirming cricopharyngeal opening via gastric fluid aspiration. Subsequently, based on Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) results, selects the safest food texture and bolus size to guide safe and effective oral intake training.
