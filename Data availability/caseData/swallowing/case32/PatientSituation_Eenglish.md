# Medical Record Information

## I. Medical Summary

**Basic Patient Information:** Female, 68 years old.

**Chief Complaint:** Nausea, poor appetite, weight loss, and fatigue for over 1 month.

**Present Illness:**  
On April 5, 2020, the patient was diagnosed with "fungal esophagitis and reflux esophagitis" at a local hospital due to "nausea and poor appetite." After one week of medication with poor efficacy and symptom aggravation, she was transferred to our Gastroenterology Department. During hospitalization, her pulmonary infection worsened, and dysphagia progressed to complete aphagia. She became bedridden and fully dependent for daily activities. Multidisciplinary consultation revealed: elevated muscle enzymes, positive myositis-specific antibodies, positive paraneoplastic antibodies; electromyography indicated decreased motor nerve amplitude; brain MRI showed small lacunar infarcts in bilateral frontoparietal lobes; gastroscopy indicated chronic non-atrophic gastritis; laryngoscopy revealed chronic mucosal hyperemia; chest CT showed inflammatory lesions in right upper lobe anterior segment, middle lobe, left upper lingular segment, and bilateral lower lobe basal segments, with right middle lobe mostly consolidated and atelectatic.  
On May 30, 2020, she was definitively diagnosed with: **Dermatomyositis, Bilateral Pneumonia, Reflux Esophagitis, Chronic Gastritis, Hypoproteinemia, Lacunar Infarction, Paraneoplastic Syndrome?**.  
On July 3, 2020, after partial stabilization of pneumonia, she was transferred to Rehabilitation Medicine for persistent **dysphagia, quadriplegic motor dysfunction, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, dysphonia, and balance dysfunction**.

**Physical Examination:**  
Poor mental status, nasogastric tube feeding, hoarse voice. Muscle strength in extremities: Grade 3. Difficulty lifting head from supine position. Positive Gottron sign, periorbital edematous heliotrope rash, scalp desquamation with erythema, neck muscle atrophy. Diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Fully dependent for Activities of Daily Living (ADL).

**Clinical Diagnoses:**
1. Dermatomyositis
2. Bilateral Pneumonia
3. Reflux Esophagitis
4. Chronic Gastritis
5. Hypoproteinemia
6. Lacunar Infarction
7. Paraneoplastic Syndrome?

**Functional Diagnoses:**
1. Dysphagia
2. Quadriplegic Motor Dysfunction
3. Cardiopulmonary Dysfunction
4. Dysphonia
5. Balance Dysfunction
6. ADL Impairment

## II. Pre-Rehabilitation Functional Assessment & Examinations

### 1. Swallowing Function & Nutritional Risk Screening
*   **Symptom Screening:** Nasogastric tube feeding, excessive oral secretions, recurrent fever
*   **EAT-10 Score:** 40
*   **Repetitive Saliva Swallowing Test (RSST):** 0 times
*   **Water Swallowing Test (WST):** Level 5
*   **NRS-2002 Score:** 6

### 2. Clinical Swallowing Assessment (July 3, 2020)
*   **Subjective Assessment:** Somnolence, poor mental status, NG tube feeding, recurrent fever, thick sputum, 10kg weight loss.
*   **Objective Assessment:**
    *   **Oral Hygiene:** Poor, with adherent sputum and excessive secretions.
    *   **Orofacial Function:** Impaired.
        *   **Mandibular Movement:** Mouth opening 2cm, chewing (Grade C), jaw drop (Grade B).
        *   **Lip Movement:** Drooling (Grade C), lip retraction (Grade C), lip rounding (Grade D), cheek puff (Grade D).
        *   **Tongue Movement:** Tongue protrusion (Grade C), left/right lateralization (Grade C), lick upper/lower lip (Grade C).
        *   **Soft Palate Movement:** Grade D.
    *   **Neck ROM & Strength:** Normal ROM, decreased strength.
    *   **Respiratory Function:** Maximum phonation time 1 second, thoracoabdominal breathing pattern.
    *   **Laryngeal Function:** Hoarse voice, absent voluntary cough/throat clear, diminished gag reflex.
    *   **Swallowing Reflexes:** Diminished pharyngeal reflex, absent cough reflex.
    *   **Swallowing Initiation:** Absent.
*   **Direct Feeding Assessment:**
    *   **VVST-CV (Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study for Critical View):** Safety and efficacy impaired.
    *   **FOIS (Functional Oral Intake Scale):** Level 1 (Nothing by mouth).
    *   **DOSS (Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale):** Level 1 (Severe dysphagia).

### 3. Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) (July 10, 2020)
VFSS revealed:  
Poor bolus transport for Test 1 (thin liquid) and Test 2 (thick liquid). Swallowing initiation entirely absent. Impaired head/neck control. Complete failure of cricopharyngeal muscle opening. No bolus passage. Significant residue in valleculae and pyriform sinuses, unresolvable by repeated swallows. Prominent regurgitation.  
**Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS):** Level 8. Absent cough reflex, weak cough strength.

**VFSS Conclusions:**
1. Oropharyngeal Dysphagia (Oral & Pharyngeal phases)
2. Silent Aspiration
3. Complete Failure of Cricopharyngeal Opening
