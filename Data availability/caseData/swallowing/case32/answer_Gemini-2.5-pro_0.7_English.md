# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

**Date of Plan:** July 10, 2020

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term goals (2-4 weeks):
*   **Safety:** Prevent aspiration pneumonia and other complications of immobility (e.g., pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, contractures).
*   **Respiratory Function:** Improve effective cough and secretion clearance; increase maximum phonation time to > 3 seconds.
*   **Swallowing Function:** Maintain oral hygiene; improve oral motor control and sensory awareness in preparation for future swallowing. Maintain NPO status with safe management of secretions.
*   **Motor Function:** Maintain full passive range of motion in all limbs; achieve active-assisted range of motion in major muscle groups; achieve independence in rolling in bed.
*   **General Condition:** Improve arousal and tolerance for therapy sessions (up to 15 minutes, twice daily); stabilize nutritional status via nasogastric tube feeding.

### Long-term goals (3-6 months):
*   **Swallowing Function:** Downgrade dysphagia severity (DOSS Level 1 -> 3-4); achieve safe intake of at least one consistency of puree/thickened liquid without aspiration (FOIS Level 1 -> 3-4); eventual weaning from nasogastric tube.
*   **Respiratory Function:** Achieve functional cough strength and independence in secretion management; achieve a maximum phonation time of > 10 seconds.
*   **Motor Function:** Improve muscle strength of all four limbs to at least Grade 4/5; achieve independent transfers from bed to chair; achieve stable independent sitting for > 30 minutes.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADL):** Achieve modified independence in basic self-care activities (feeding, grooming) at the bedside.
*   **Communication:** Improve vocal quality from hoarse to functional for communication.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### I. Dysphagia Rehabilitation

*   **Strict NPO (Nothing by Mouth):** Absolute contraindication for any oral food or liquid intake based on VFSS findings of silent aspiration (PAS 8) and complete UES non-opening.
*   **Oral Hygiene and Secretion Management:**
    *   Meticulous oral care with a suction toothbrush at least 3 times daily to reduce oral bacterial load.
    *   Regular oropharyngeal suctioning to manage secretions and prevent passive aspiration.
*   **Indirect Swallowing Therapy (Therapy without food):**
    *   **Oral Motor Exercises:** Gentle active-assisted and active exercises for tongue (protrusion, lateralization), lips (rounding, retraction), and jaw (opening/closing) to improve range of motion and control. 5 repetitions each, twice daily, monitoring for fatigue.
    *   **Laryngeal/Pharyngeal Exercises:**
        *   **Modified Shaker Exercise (Head Lift):** Begin with isometric holds in supine with therapist support, progressing to active head lifts as neck flexor strength improves. This targets suprahyoid muscles to aid laryngeal elevation and UES opening.
        *   **Effortful Pitch Glides:** Patient to slide voice from low to high pitch to facilitate pharyngeal and laryngeal muscle contraction and elevation.
        *   **Thermal-Tactile Stimulation (TTS):** Apply a chilled laryngeal mirror to the faucial arches to heighten sensory input and prime the swallowing reflex.
    *   **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES):** Application of surface electrodes to the suprahyoid region to facilitate muscle contraction during swallowing exercises. Use low intensity and monitor for skin integrity and patient tolerance.

### II. Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation

*   **Pulmonary Hygiene:**
    *   **Postural Drainage:** Position patient to drain affected lung segments, coordinated with chest physiotherapy.
    *   **Chest Physiotherapy:** Manual percussion and vibration over consolidated lung areas to mobilize secretions, as tolerated.
    *   **Assisted Coughing:** Provide abdominal/costophrenic assist during coughing attempts to improve expiratory force.
*   **Breathing Exercises:**
    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing Training:** Use manual cues on the abdomen to facilitate diaphragmatic movement and improve breathing efficiency.
    *   **Pursed-Lip Breathing:** To reduce respiratory rate and improve gas exchange.
    *   **Incentive Spirometry:** To increase lung volumes and prevent further atelectasis. Target low, sustained volumes initially.
*   **Respiratory Muscle Training (RMT):** Initiate low-resistance inspiratory and expiratory muscle training to improve the strength of the diaphragm and accessory respiratory muscles.

### III. Physical Therapy (Motor and Balance Dysfunction)

*   **Positioning and Prevention:**
    *   Implement a 2-hour turning schedule to prevent pressure ulcers.
    *   Use positioning aids (pillows, wedges) to maintain joint alignment and prevent contractures.
*   **Range of Motion (ROM) Program:**
    *   **Passive ROM:** Full PROM for all extremities, twice daily.
    *   **Active-Assisted ROM:** For all major joints, encouraging patient participation within their tolerance.
*   **Strengthening Program (low intensity, low repetition):**
    *   **Isometric Exercises:** For quadriceps, gluteals, and upper extremity muscles. Hold for 5 seconds, rest for 10 seconds.
    *   **Active Gravity-Eliminated Exercises:** For muscle groups with Grade 3 strength (e.g., hip abduction/adduction in supine).
    *   **Axial Muscle Strengthening:** Gentle, supported cervical isometric exercises and core stabilization exercises (e.g., abdominal bracing).
*   **Functional Mobility Training:**
    *   **Bed Mobility:** Training in rolling, bridging, and scooting with therapist assistance.
    *   **Balance Training:** Begin with static sitting at the edge of the bed with maximum trunk support. Progress duration and reduce support as tolerated. Monitor vital signs closely for orthostatic intolerance.

### IV. Voice Therapy

*   **Vocal Function Exercises:** Gentle humming and sustained vowels at a comfortable pitch to improve vocal fold closure and reduce strain.
*   **Coordination with Respiratory Therapy:** Synchronize phonation attempts with controlled exhalation to maximize breath support and vocal efficiency.

### V. Interdisciplinary Collaboration

*   **Nutritional Support:** Continue nasogastric tube feeding. Liaise closely with the dietitian to ensure the feeding formula provides adequate calories and high protein to address hypoalbuminemia and support muscle recovery.
*   **Medical Management:** Regular communication with the primary medical team to monitor the activity of the dermatomyositis (e.g., muscle enzyme levels). Rehabilitation intensity will be titrated based on disease activity, signs of systemic inflammation (fever), and patient fatigue.
*   **Patient and Family Education:** Educate the patient and family on the rationale for NPO status, the importance of all therapeutic interventions, energy conservation techniques, and the signs of therapy intolerance or aspiration. Provide psychological support and encouragement.
