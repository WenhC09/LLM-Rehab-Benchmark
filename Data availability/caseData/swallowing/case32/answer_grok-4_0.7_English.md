# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (1–3 months):
- Improve swallowing safety to reduce aspiration risk (target: Penetration-Aspiration Scale [PAS] ≤ 6).
- Enhance oropharyngeal muscle strength to initiate swallowing reflex (target: Repetitive Saliva Swallowing Test [RSST] ≥ 2 times).
- Increase muscle strength in extremities to Grade 4 to support basic mobility.
- Improve cardiopulmonary endurance to sustain 5–10 minutes of low-intensity activity without dyspnea.
- Enhance vocal clarity to achieve audible phonation for basic communication.
- Achieve partial independence in basic Activities of Daily Living (ADL) with assistive devices.

### Long-term Goals (3–12 months):
- Achieve safe oral intake with modified textures (target: Functional Oral Intake Scale [FOIS] Level 3–4).
- Restore muscle strength to Grade 4+ to 5 for functional ambulation and transfers.
- Improve balance to allow safe sitting and standing with minimal assistance.
- Attain clear phonation and functional communication for social interaction.
- Achieve full independence in modified ADL or minimal assistance with adaptive equipment.
- Optimize cardiopulmonary function to support daily activities without fatigue.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### Swallowing Rehabilitation
- **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES):** Apply NMES to suprahyoid and laryngeal muscles (20–30 minutes, 5 days/week) to enhance muscle activation and swallowing reflex initiation.
- **Oropharyngeal Muscle Strengthening:**
  - Suprahyoid exercises (e.g., Shaker exercise, chin tuck against resistance): 3 sets of 10 repetitions, 5 days/week, to improve hyolaryngeal elevation.
  - Tongue resistance exercises (e.g., pushing against a tongue depressor): 3 sets of 10 repetitions, 5 days/week, to enhance tongue strength and coordination.
  - Effortful swallow training: 10–15 repetitions, 3 sessions/day, to improve pharyngeal clearance.
- **Thermal-Tactile Stimulation:** Apply cold stimulation to anterior faucial arches (10 strokes, 3 times/day) to trigger swallowing reflex.
- **Compensatory Strategies:**
  - Maintain upright posture (90°) during feeding attempts to reduce aspiration risk.
  - Continue nasogastric tube feeding with gradual introduction of small-volume, thickened liquid trials under supervision (e.g., 5–10 mL thickened water, 2–3 times/day, as tolerated).
- **Oral Hygiene Program:** Regular cleaning with antiseptic mouthwash and suctioning to manage secretions and reduce infection risk (3–4 times/day).
- **Monitoring:** Weekly clinical swallowing assessments; repeat Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) in 6–8 weeks to evaluate progress.

### Motor Function Rehabilitation
- **Progressive Resistance Training:**
  - Upper and lower extremity exercises using light resistance bands (1–2 kg): 3 sets of 10–12 repetitions, 5 days/week, targeting major muscle groups (deltoids, biceps, quadriceps, hamstrings).
  - Focus on proximal muscle strengthening to address dermatomyositis-related weakness.
- **Passive and Active-Assisted Range of Motion (ROM):** Daily sessions (20 minutes, 2 times/day) to prevent contractures, particularly in neck and shoulder muscles.
- **Functional Training:**
  - Bedside sitting with support to improve trunk control (5–10 minutes, 3 times/day).
  - Assisted transfers using slide boards (2–3 trials/day) to progress toward independent transfers.
- **Balance Training:**
  - Static sitting balance exercises on a therapy ball with therapist support (5–10 minutes, 5 days/week).
  - Progress to dynamic balance tasks (e.g., reaching tasks in seated position) as tolerated.

### Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation
- **Breathing Exercises:**
  - Diaphragmatic breathing: 10–15 repetitions, 3 times/day, to enhance thoracoabdominal coordination.
  - Pursed-lip breathing: 10 repetitions, 3 times/day, to reduce dyspnea and improve oxygenation.
- **Aerobic Conditioning:**
  - Initiate low-intensity upper limb ergometry (5 minutes, 3–5 days/week) at 20–30% of maximum heart rate, adjusted for patient tolerance.
  - Monitor oxygen saturation and heart rate to maintain SpO2 ≥ 92% and avoid overexertion.
- **Chest Physiotherapy:**
  - Postural drainage and percussion (10–15 minutes, 2 times/day) to mobilize secretions and improve lung aeration.
  - Incentive spirometry: 10 breaths, 3–4 times/day, to enhance lung expansion.

### Speech and Dysphonia Rehabilitation
- **Vocal Cord Strengthening:**
  - Vocal adduction exercises (e.g., sustained “ee” phonation): 5–10 seconds, 10 repetitions, 3 times/day, to improve vocal fold closure.
  - Pitch glide exercises: 5 repetitions, 3 times/day, to enhance vocal range.
- **Respiratory Support for Speech:**
  - Coordinate with breathing exercises to improve breath support phonation (e.g., sustained phonation during exhalation,–10 seconds, 10 repetitions/day).
- **Articulation Training:**
  - Lip and tongue articulation exercises (e.g., repeating “pa-ta-ka”): 10, 3 times/day, to improve clarity.

### ADL Functional Independence
- **Occup Therapy:**
  - Train in of adaptive equipment (e.g., long-handled utensils, toilet seat) to support ADL (30 minutes/day, 5 days/week).
  - Practice self-care tasks (e.g., grooming, dressing) with maximal assistance, progressing to moderate assistance as strength improves.
- **Environmental Modifications:** Recommend elevated and grab bars to facilitate safe transfers and reduce fall risk.
### Nutritional Support
- **Dietary Management:**
  - nasogastric tube feeding with high-protein formula (1.5–2.0 g/kg/day protein) to address hypoproteinemia and support muscle recovery.
  - Weekly monitoring of weight, albumin and prealbumin levels to assess nutritional status.
- **Mult Coordination:** Consult with dietitian to adjust caloric intake based on gain and swallowing progress.

### Psychosocial Support
- **Psychological Support:** Weekly counseling sessions to address emotional distress from dependency and chronic illness.
- ** Education:** Train caregivers in safe feeding techniques, positioning, and mobility assistance to ensure continuity of care at home.

### Monitoring and Follow-Up
- **Weekly Assessments:** Evaluate muscle strength, swallowing function, and cardiopulmonary status to treatment intensity.
- **Interdisciplinary Team Meetings:** Biweekly meetings with gastroenterology, pulmonology, and neurology to monitor dermatomyositis progression, pneumonia resolution, and potential paraneoplastic syndrome
- **Repeat VFSS and Electromyography:** In 812 weeks to assess swallowing and neuromuscular improvements.
- **Pain and Fatigue Management:** Monitor for dermatomyositis-related pain or fatigue; adjust exercise intensity to avoid overexertion.
