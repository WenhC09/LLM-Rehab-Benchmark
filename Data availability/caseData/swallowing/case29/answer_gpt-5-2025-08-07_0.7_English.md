## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (within 4 weeks)
1. Improve nutritional status through optimized enteral feeding and initiation of safe, minimal-volume oral trials under supervision.
2. Enhance oral-motor and swallowing muscle strength to reduce oral residue and improve bolus control.
3. Improve laryngeal elevation and airway protection to reduce aspiration risk.
4. Strengthen cough reflex and expiratory force to improve airway clearance.
5. Maintain or slightly increase systemic muscle mass and strength to support swallowing function.
6. Improve oral hygiene to reduce risk of aspiration pneumonia.
7. Educate patient and caregivers on safe swallowing strategies and aspiration precautions.

### Long-term Goals (within 3–6 months)
1. Achieve partial to full oral intake of modified-texture diet without aspiration, reducing or eliminating dependence on nasogastric tube.
2. Restore sufficient nutritional status (BMI >18, albumin >35 g/L, prealbumin within normal range).
3. Enhance systemic muscle strength and endurance to normal or near-normal levels for age and sex.
4. Improve cognitive function to support independent feeding and adherence to compensatory strategies.
5. Maintain safe swallowing and respiratory function to prevent recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
6. Enable participation in daily activities and improved quality of life.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Nutritional Management
- **Enteral Nutrition Optimization**:  
  - Continue nasogastric tube feeding with energy target 30–35 kcal/kg/day and protein 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day.
  - Divide into 5–6 feeds/day, slow infusion to reduce reflux risk.
  - Monitor gastric residual volume; adjust feeding rate/volume accordingly.
- **Nutritional Supplements**:  
  - Add branched-chain amino acids to support muscle synthesis.
  - Consider omega-3 fatty acids to reduce inflammation.
- **Micronutrient Supplementation**:  
  - Correct deficiencies in vitamins (B complex, D) and minerals (zinc, selenium).
- **Regular Monitoring**:  
  - Weekly weight, serum albumin, prealbumin, electrolytes.

### B. Dysphagia Rehabilitation
- **Direct Therapy** (under instrumental guidance, e.g., FEES/VFSS):
  - Initiate with minimal volumes (≤3 mL) of pudding-thick consistency under therapist supervision.
  - Progress only if no aspiration is observed.
- **Indirect Therapy** (no bolus):
  - **Oral-Motor Exercises**:  
    - Lip closure training (resistance exercises with tongue depressor).
    - Tongue range-of-motion and strength training (protrusion, lateralization, elevation, resistance).
    - Cheek puffing and sucking exercises.
  - **Swallowing Muscle Strengthening**:  
    - Effortful swallow.
    - Mendelsohn maneuver (if cognitively feasible).
    - Masako maneuver (tongue-hold swallow) for pharyngeal constrictor strengthening.
    - Shaker exercise or chin tuck against resistance (CTAR) for suprahyoid strengthening.
  - **Respiratory–Swallow Coordination**:
    - Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST) with threshold device.
    - Voluntary cough and throat clearing drills.
  - **Sensory Stimulation**:
    - Thermal-tactile stimulation to anterior faucial pillars.
    - Sour or cold bolus trials to enhance swallow trigger.

### C. Postural and Compensatory Strategies
- Upright sitting at 90° during and 30 min after feeding.
- Chin tuck posture during swallowing to improve airway protection.
- Head rotation to the weaker side to direct bolus to stronger pharyngeal side.
- Multiple swallows per bolus to reduce residue.

### D. Respiratory Function Training
- Diaphragmatic breathing exercises.
- Incentive spirometry twice daily.
- EMST as above to improve cough strength.
- Breath-holding exercises to coordinate with swallowing.

### E. Systemic Muscle Strengthening (Sarcopenia Management)
- Progressive resistance training for major muscle groups (elastic bands, light weights).
- Functional mobility training (sit-to-stand, walking practice with safety precautions).
- Balance training to reduce fall risk.
- Aerobic exercise (low-intensity cycling/step training) as tolerated.

### F. Cognitive Rehabilitation
- Attention, memory, and executive function exercises tailored to mild cognitive impairment.
- Use of visual/verbal cues to aid in swallowing strategies.
- Caregiver-assisted reinforcement.

### G. Oral Hygiene Program
- Twice-daily toothbrushing with soft brush.
- Chlorhexidine mouth rinse (0.12–0.2%) if tolerated.
- Suctioning of oral secretions if patient cannot clear effectively.

### H. Education & Caregiver Training
- Training in preparation and administration of modified diets.
- Instruction on aspiration precautions and emergency response to choking.
- Guidance on safe feeding positions and pacing.
- Importance of adherence to exercise program.

### I. Monitoring & Re-evaluation
- Weekly swallowing reassessment (clinical and, if indicated, instrumental).
- Monthly nutritional and muscle mass evaluation.
- Adjust rehabilitation plan based on progress and safety.
