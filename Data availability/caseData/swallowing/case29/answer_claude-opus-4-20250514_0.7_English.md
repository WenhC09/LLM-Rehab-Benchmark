### **Rehabilitation Treatment Plan**

#### 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
**Short-term goals:**
- Improve swallowing safety and efficiency to reduce aspiration risk.
- Increase oral intake to at least 800 mL/day with appropriate food textures.
- Enhance muscle strength and endurance, particularly in swallowing-related muscles.
- Stabilize cognitive function and improve engagement in rehabilitation activities.

**Long-term goals:**
- Achieve independent oral feeding without the need for a nasogastric tube.
- Restore swallowing function to a level that allows for safe consumption of a variety of food textures (IDDSI Level 4 or higher).
- Improve overall nutritional status, aiming for a BMI of at least 18.5.
- Enhance overall physical function, including gait speed and muscle strength, to support daily activities.

#### 2. Treatment Methods:
**A. Swallowing Rehabilitation:**
- **Therapeutic Exercises:** Implement a regimen of oropharyngeal exercises focusing on strengthening the suprahyoid muscles and improving tongue mobility. Exercises may include:
  - Tongue resistance exercises using a tongue depressor.
  - Effortful swallow techniques to enhance pharyngeal contraction.
  - Shaker exercises to improve laryngeal elevation.

- **Swallowing Strategies:** Educate the patient on safe swallowing techniques, including:
  - Chin tuck maneuver to protect the airway during swallowing.
  - Small bites and sips to manage volume and reduce aspiration risk.
  - Use of thickened liquids (IDDSI Level 2) to improve swallowing safety.

- **Dietary Modifications:** Collaborate with a dietitian to create a tailored meal plan that includes:
  - Nutrient-dense, high-calorie foods that are easy to swallow.
  - Gradual introduction of food textures based on swallowing assessments.

**B. Nutritional Support:**
- **Nutritional Intervention:** Initiate a comprehensive nutritional plan to address malnutrition, including:
  - High-protein supplements to support muscle mass recovery.
  - Regular monitoring of weight and nutritional intake.
  - Consideration of enteral nutrition if oral intake remains inadequate.

**C. Physical Rehabilitation:**
- **Strength Training:** Implement a progressive resistance training program focusing on:
  - Upper and lower limb strength to combat sarcopenia.
  - Specific exercises targeting the neck and jaw muscles to support swallowing.

- **Endurance Training:** Introduce low-impact aerobic exercises (e.g., walking, stationary cycling) to improve overall endurance and cardiovascular health.

**D. Cognitive and Respiratory Support:**
- **Cognitive Engagement:** Incorporate cognitive exercises and activities to stimulate mental function, such as:
  - Memory games and problem-solving tasks.
  - Encouragement of social interaction during meals to enhance cognitive engagement.

- **Respiratory Therapy:** Implement breathing exercises to improve respiratory function and cough effectiveness, including:
  - Diaphragmatic breathing exercises.
  - Cough training techniques to enhance airway clearance.

**E. Multidisciplinary Approach:**
- Regular team meetings involving speech therapists, dietitians, physical therapists, and nursing staff to ensure coordinated care and progress monitoring.
- Continuous assessment and adjustment of the rehabilitation plan based on the patient's response and progress.

**F. Safety Measures:**
- Implement fall prevention strategies due to high fall risk, including:
  - Environmental modifications to reduce hazards.
  - Regular mobility assessments and assistance as needed.
