### **I. Medical Record Summary**

**Patient Information**: Female, 51 years old.

**Chief Complaint**: Dysphagia for over 8 months, aggravated for over 3 months.

**Present Illness**:  
On October 4, 2022, the patient presented to a local hospital with sudden-onset headache, dizziness, and gait instability. Diagnosis: "Intracerebral Hemorrhage (left frontal lobe)" with a hemorrhage volume of ~10 mL. After symptomatic management (dehydration, intracranial pressure reduction, neuroprotection) in the ICU for 35 days, her condition improved, and she was transferred to a general ward. A nasogastric tube was maintained for nutrition throughout treatment. Repeated swallowing screenings indicated abnormalities, clinically manifesting as coughing during drinking, effortful swallowing, and significant oropharyngeal residue. Routine oral-facial organ function training during hospitalization yielded no significant improvement. She was discharged on January 12, 2023, continuing home nutrition via nasogastric tube.  
Since February 2023, dysphagia progressively worsened, accompanied by significant weight loss (20 kg over 3 months pre-admission). Daily liquid intake was <500 mL, with reflux occurring with larger volumes. Multiple rehabilitation attempts at various hospitals showed minimal effect. She was admitted to our department on May 12, 2023, for "dysphagia investigation." As shown in the attached "Admission Status" image, the patient presented with severe emaciation.

**Clinical Diagnoses**:  
1.  Sarcopenia  
2.  Sequelae of Intracerebral Hemorrhage  

**Functional Diagnoses**:  
1.  Sarcopenic Dysphagia  
2.  Mild Cognitive Impairment

### **II. Functional Assessments**

**1. Nutritional Assessment (May 12, 2023)**  
*   **NRS-2002 Score**: 6 (indicating nutritional risk).  
*   **Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) Score**: 2.  
*   **Anthropometry**: Height 158 cm, Weight 38.9 kg, BMI 15.6 (Underweight).  
*   **Muscle Ultrasound**: Color Doppler imaging of masseter and mylohyoid muscles showed significantly reduced thickness compared to normal references.  
*   **Laboratory Tests**: Albumin 29 g/L, Prealbumin 99 g/L (indicating severe malnutrition).  

**2. Swallowing Function Assessment**  
*   **Clinical Functional Assessment (May 12, 2023)**:  
    *   Neck Mobility: Prefers anterior flexion posture; mild limitation in extension.  
    *   Orofacial Function: Mouth opening 2.5 cm (mildly restricted); insufficient chewing force; drooling during forward leaning or inattention; mildly impaired lip seal; occasional air leakage during cheek puffing; tongue tremor present; tongue protrusion deviates right with marked tremor and reduced range; incomplete lateral tongue movement; reduced range in licking upper/lower lips.  
    *   Phonation & Laryngeal Function: Maximum phonation time 4 seconds; weakened voluntary cough and throat clearing; laryngeal elevation <2 cm.  
    *   Swallowing Tests: Repetitive Saliva Swallowing Test (RSST): 3 swallows; Volume-Viscosity Swallowing Test (V-VST): Impaired safety and efficacy with 5 mL of Level 2 (nectar-thick) liquid; Water Swallowing Test (WST): Grade V.  

*   **Videoendoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (VEES) (May 13, 2023)**:  
    *   Static Observation: Significantly widened pharyngeal space; normal spontaneous swallow frequency; reduced mobility of left vocal cord and arytenoid wall (likely NG-tube related); Murray Secretion Scale Grade 1.  
    *   Dynamic Observation: Reduced tongue base retraction, pharyngeal wall contraction, bilateral vocal cord adduction/abduction; breath hold achieved; normal response to light touch on bilateral arytenoids.  
    *   Food Test (5 mL thin liquid): Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale Grade 4 in valleculae and pyriform sinuses; laryngeal penetration observed; no spontaneous clearance efforts; Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) Grade 8.  
    *   Conclusion: Oral and pharyngeal phase dysphagia.  

*   **Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) (May 13, 2023)**:  
    *   With 5 mL moderately thick food in natural sitting position: Impaired head control, mild oral containment and transit impairment.  
    *   Pharyngeal Phase: Significantly widened pharyngeal space; delayed swallow trigger; mildly reduced tongue base retraction and pharyngeal constrictor strength.  
    *   Residue: Bilateral residue in valleculae and significant bilateral residue in pyriform sinuses; partial clearance achieved with multiple swallows and head turn (left/right).  
    *   Aspiration: Frank aspiration observed with 5 mL moderately thick food; weak cough reflex; unable to fully clear despite cueing.  
    *   Conclusion: ① Dysphagia (oral & pharyngeal phases); ② Aspiration.  

**3. Digestive Function Assessment (May 16, 2023)**  
*   Gastric Residual Volume (GRV) estimated via Antral Cross-Sectional Area (CSA) measurement using ultrasound (vertical double-diameter method).  
*   Measurements: Antral Antero-Posterior Diameter (AP) 1.48 cm; Antral Cranio-Caudal Diameter (CC) 4.26 cm.  
*   Calculations: CSA = 3.142 × (AP × CC) / 4 = 4.95 cm²; GRV(mL) = 27.0 + 14.6 × CSA(cm²) - 1.28 × age(y) = 33.99 mL.  
*   Conclusion: Significantly reduced gastric volume.  

**4. Muscle Strength & Endurance Assessment (May 14, 2023)**  
*   **Muscle Mass**: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA): Muscle mass index >2 SD below peak normal reference; Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA): Body fat and skeletal muscle mass below normal range.  
*   **Swallowing Muscles**: Surface electromyography (sEMG) of suprahyoid muscles: Reduced amplitude and weak EMG signal, indicating decreased muscle contraction.  
*   **Systemic Muscle Function**: Limb muscle strength Grade 4; Handgrip strength 3.7 kg; Calf circumference 29.7 cm; Gait speed <1 m/s.  

**5. Cognitive Function Assessment (May 12, 2023)**  
*   Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (adjusted for high school education): Score 17.  

**6. Respiratory Function Assessment (May 12, 2023)**  
*   Breathing Pattern: Shallow breathing; Respiratory rate 20-22/min.  
*   Maximum expiration time: 2 seconds.  
*   Weakened cough reflex.  

**7. Nursing Assessment (May 12, 2023)**  
*   **Oral Status**: Excessive oral secretions; Oral hygiene score 10.  
*   **Feeding Method**: Intermittent tube feeding.  
*   **Risk Assessment**: Fall Risk Assessment Score 14 (High Risk); Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Risk: Low.  
*   **Swallowing Subjective Perception**: Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) Score 35.
