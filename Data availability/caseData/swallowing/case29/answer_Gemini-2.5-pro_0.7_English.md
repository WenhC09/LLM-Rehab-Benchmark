### **1. Rehabilitation Goals**

#### **Short-term goals (4-6 weeks):**

1.  **Nutritional Stabilization & Anabolism:**
    *   Achieve and tolerate target enteral nutrition goals ( caloric and protein requirements) via nasogastric tube without complications such as reflux, vomiting, or significant diarrhea.
    *   Demonstrate initial improvement in nutritional markers (e.g., increase in prealbumin, stabilization or slight increase in body weight).
2.  **Prevention of Complications:**
    *   Prevent aspiration pneumonia by maintaining strict NPO status and implementing a rigorous oral hygiene protocol.
    *   Improve oral hygiene, reducing OHAT score from 10 to â‰¤ 5.
    *   Reduce risk of falls through environmental modifications and supervised mobility.
3.  **Activation of Swallowing & Respiratory Musculature:**
    *   Improve voluntary cough strength and effectiveness.
    *   Increase maximum phonation time from 4 seconds to >6 seconds.
    *   Improve oral motor control, including increased tongue protrusion and lateralization range, and improved lip seal strength.
    *   Demonstrate consistent activation of suprahyoid muscles with sEMG biofeedback.
4.  **Enhance Therapeutic Participation:**
    *   Patient will be able to consistently follow 1-2 step commands during rehabilitation sessions.
    *   Patient and family will demonstrate understanding of the rationale for NPO status and the importance of the rehabilitation program.

#### **Long-term goals (3-6 months):**

1.  **Restoration of Safe Oral Intake:**
    *   Transition from NPO to safe oral intake of therapeutic amounts of specific food textures (e.g., IDDSI Level 4 - Pureed), confirmed by instrumental assessment (VFSS/VEES).
    *   Gradually increase volume and variety of oral diet with the ultimate aim of discontinuing nasogastric tube feeding for nutrition.
2.  **Functional Swallowing Improvement:**
    *   Improve swallow efficiency, evidenced by a reduction in pharyngeal residue (Yale Pharyngeal Residue Scale < Grade 2) on instrumental assessment.
    *   Eliminate aspiration across tested consistencies (PAS score of 1-2).
    *   Achieve functional hyolaryngeal excursion (>2 cm) during swallow.
3.  **Reversal of Sarcopenia & Functional Mobility:**
    *   Increase skeletal muscle mass index as measured by BIA/DXA.
    *   Increase grip strength to >10 kg.
    *   Improve lower limb strength to facilitate independent ambulation with or without an assistive device.
4.  **Improvement in Quality of Life:**
    *   Achieve a significant reduction in the EAT-10 score.
    *   Patient reports improved confidence and reduced effort during swallowing trials.

### **2. Treatment Methods**

#### **1. Nutritional Rehabilitation (Priority #1)**
*   **Method**: Continuous enteral nutrition via nasogastric tube.
    *   **Rationale**: The patient's reduced gastric capacity and history of reflux with larger volumes contraindicate bolus feeding. Continuous feeding will optimize nutrient absorption and minimize gastrointestinal intolerance.
*   **Prescription**:
    *   Initiate a high-protein, high-calorie formula.
    *   Start at a slow rate (e.g., 20-30 mL/hr) and titrate upwards by 10 mL/hr every 8-12 hours as tolerated, to a target goal determined by a dietitian consultation (approx. 1600-1800 kcal/day, 1.5 g protein/kg target body weight).
    *   Maintain head-of-bed elevation at 30-45 degrees during and for 1 hour after feeding.
*   **Monitoring**: Weekly weight checks, monitoring of serum albumin and prealbumin, daily monitoring for signs of intolerance (abdominal distension, reflux).

#### **2. Swallowing Therapy (Intensive, 5x/week)**
*   **Status**: Strict NPO (Nil Per Os). No oral intake of food or liquid outside of therapist-administered therapeutic trials.
*   **Oral Motor Exercises**:
    *   **Lips**: Pushing against a tongue depressor, pursing/smiling repetitions.
    *   **Tongue**: Protrusion, lateralization, and elevation against resistance (tongue depressor). Masako maneuver (tongue-hold swallow) to increase posterior pharyngeal wall engagement.
    *   **Jaw**: Range of motion exercises to address limited opening.
*   **Pharyngeal Strengthening Exercises**:
    *   **Shaker Exercise (Head-Lift)**: To strengthen suprahyoid muscles and improve hyolaryngeal excursion.
    *   **Effortful Swallow**: To increase tongue base retraction and pharyngeal pressure.
    *   **Mendelsohn Maneuver**: To prolong and increase the extent of laryngeal elevation and upper esophageal sphincter opening. Will require significant tactile and verbal cueing due to cognitive status.
*   **Airway Protection & Respiratory Support**:
    *   **Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST)**: Use of a pressure threshold device, starting at a low threshold and progressing, to improve cough strength and expiratory force. 5 sets of 5 repetitions, daily.
    *   **Volitional Cough Training**: Practice sharp, forceful coughing on command.
*   **Biofeedback & Stimulation**:
    *   **Surface EMG (sEMG) Biofeedback**: Applied to the submental (suprahyoid) region during Effortful Swallows and Mendelsohn Maneuvers to provide visual feedback and enhance motor learning.
    *   **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**: Application to the suprahyoid muscle group to facilitate contraction during swallowing exercises.

#### **3. Physical Therapy (5x/week)**
*   **Goal**: Combat systemic sarcopenia and deconditioning.
*   **Progressive Resistance Training (PRT)**:
    *   Start with low-intensity exercises using resistance bands and light weights for major muscle groups (upper and lower extremities).
    *   Focus on functional movements: sit-to-stand, bridging, heel raises.
*   **Balance & Gait Training**:
    *   Static and dynamic sitting balance exercises.
    *   Progress to standing balance and pre-gait activities as strength improves.
    *   Address postural preference for forward flexion with gentle stretching and postural cueing.
*   **Endurance Training**:
    *   Bedside cycling or graded walking once safe to do so.

#### **4. Cognitive Rehabilitation**
*   **Strategy**: Integrated into all therapies.
*   **Methods**:
    *   Use simple, clear, one-to-two-step commands.
    *   Employ frequent repetition and demonstration.
    *   Use visual aids (e.g., pictures of exercises, sEMG screen).
    *   Structure sessions to be predictable and routine to minimize confusion.

#### **5. Nursing Care & Patient/Family Education**
*   **Oral Hygiene**: Aggressive oral care protocol 3-4 times daily (before therapy, after any oral residue exposure) using a soft-bristled brush, non-foaming toothpaste, and suction to minimize bacterial load.
*   **Positioning**: Ensure patient is seated upright in a chair for several hours daily to improve respiratory function and prevent contractures.
*   **Family Training**: Educate family on the critical nature of the NPO status, the rationale behind the exercises, proper oral hygiene techniques, and safe positioning.

#### **6. Re-assessment Schedule**
*   **Weekly**: Bedside swallowing assessment, monitoring of weight and tolerance to tube feeding.
*   **4-6 weeks**: Repeat VFSS/VEES to objectively evaluate changes in swallowing physiology and safety, and to guide decisions regarding potential initiation of oral trials. Repeat nutritional lab work and muscle strength measurements (grip strength).
