# Rehabilitation Treatment Plan

## 1. Rehabilitation Goals

### Short-term Goals (4–8 weeks):
- **Nutritional Improvement**: Increase body weight by 2–3 kg and improve serum albumin to ≥35 g/L through optimized enteral nutrition and supplementation.
- **Swallowing Safety**: Reduce aspiration risk (Penetration-Aspiration Scale score <6) with nectar-thick liquids (Level 2) during swallowing trials.
- **Oral and Pharyngeal Muscle Strength**: Improve suprahyoid muscle activation (sEMG amplitude increase by 10%) and tongue movement range by 20%.
- **Functional Mobility**: Enhance gait speed to ≥1.2 m/s and reduce fall risk score to <10.
- **Cognitive Support**: Stabilize MMSE score (≥17) with cognitive exercises to support swallowing training compliance.

### Long-term Goals (3–6 months):
- **Nutritional Stability**: Achieve BMI ≥18.5 and maintain serum albumin ≥38 g/L to reverse sarcopenia.
- **Swallowing Function**: Transition to safe oral intake with moderately thick foods (Level 3) without aspiration, achieving Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale Grade ≤2.
- **Muscle Function**: Restore limb muscle strength to Grade 5 and handgrip strength to ≥10 kg.
- **Functional Independence**: Achieve independent feeding with modified textures and improve gait stability for community ambulation.
- **Cognitive Improvement**: Increase MMSE score to ≥20 to support daily activities and rehabilitation adherence.

## 2. Treatment Methods

### A. Nutritional Management
- **Enteral Nutrition**: Continue nasogastric tube feeding with high-protein, high-calorie formula (1.5 kcal/mL, 70–80 g protein/day) to deliver 1800–2000 kcal/day, divided into 5–6 bolus feeds (300–400 mL each) to minimize gastric residual volume (<50 mL).
- **Supplementation**: Administer oral nutritional supplements (e.g., protein shakes, 200 kcal/serving) during swallowing training if tolerated. Add multivitamin with zinc and vitamin D (1000 IU/day) to support muscle recovery.
- **Monitoring**: Weekly anthropometry (weight, calf circumference) and biweekly labs (albumin, prealbumin) to track nutritional progress. Adjust caloric intake based on weight gain (target 0.5 kg/week).

### B. Swallowing Rehabilitation
- **Orofacial Muscle Training** (5 days/week, 30 min/session):
  - **Tongue Exercises**: Resistance training with tongue depressor (10 reps, 3 sets) to improve protrusion and lateral movement. Practice licking thickened paste off lips to enhance coordination.
  - **Lip and Cheek Exercises**: Cheek puffing with resistance (10 reps, 3 sets) and lip seal exercises (e.g., holding a button with lips, 10 reps) to reduce drooling and improve oral containment.
  - **Jaw Mobility**: Guided mouth-opening exercises to increase range to ≥3 cm (10 reps, 2 sets).
- **Swallowing Maneuvers** (5 days/week, supervised by speech-language pathologist):
  - **Effortful Swallow**: Practice with 5 mL nectar-thick liquid to enhance pharyngeal constriction (10 reps, 3 sets).
  - **Supraglottic Swallow**: Train breath-hold before swallowing to protect airway (10 reps, 2 sets).
  - **Head Turn Maneuver**: Perform left/right head turns during swallowing to reduce residue (5 reps/side, 2 sets).
- **Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)**: Apply to suprahyoid muscles (20 min/session, 5 days/week) to enhance muscle activation, targeting sEMG amplitude improvement.
- **Swallowing Trials**: Gradual introduction of 5 mL nectar-thick liquids (Level 2) under supervision, progressing to 10 mL if no aspiration occurs (PAS <6). Use videofluoroscopy every 2 weeks to monitor residue and aspiration.
- **Oral Hygiene**: Daily oral care (brushing, antiseptic rinse) to reduce secretion accumulation and infection risk.

### C. Physical Rehabilitation
- **Strength Training** (5 days/week, 30–45 min/session):
  - **Lower Limbs**: Seated leg press and calf raises (10 reps, 3 sets, 50–60% 1RM) to improve gait stability.
  - **Upper Limbs**: Handgrip exercises with resistance ball (10 reps, 3 sets) to increase grip strength.
  - **Core Stability**: Seated abdominal contractions (10 reps, 2 sets) to support posture and swallowing mechanics.
- **Aerobic Exercise**: Stationary cycling (10–15 min, 3 days/week, low intensity) to improve endurance and respiratory function.
- **Balance Training**: Standing balance exercises with support (e.g., tandem stance, 30 sec, 3 sets) to reduce fall risk, progressing to unsupported as tolerated.
- **Gait Training**: Assisted walking with walker (10–15 min, 5 days/week), focusing on increasing speed and stability.

### D. Respiratory and Cough Training
- **Respiratory Muscle Training**: Inspiratory muscle trainer (10–15 min, 5 days/week, 30% max inspiratory pressure) to improve shallow breathing and maximum expiration time (target ≥5 seconds).
- **Cough Reflex Training**: Voluntary cough practice (10 reps, 2 sets) to strengthen airway clearance, guided by respiratory therapist.
- **Breathing Exercises**: Diaphragmatic breathing (5 min, 3 sets/day) to reduce respiratory rate to 16–18/min.

### E. Cognitive and Psychological Support
- **Cognitive Training** (3 days/week, 20 min/session):
  - Memory exercises (e.g., word recall, 5–10 items) to support swallowing instruction retention.
  - Attention tasks (e.g., sorting cards) to improve focus during rehabilitation.
- **Psychological Support**: Weekly counseling to address anxiety related to dysphagia and weight loss, encouraging adherence to therapy.
- **Caregiver Education**: Train family on feeding techniques, aspiration precautions, and fall prevention strategies.

### F. Monitoring and Follow-up
- **Weekly Assessments**: Track weight, swallowing performance (RSST, V-VST), and fall risk score.
- **Biweekly Assessments**: Repeat VEES/VFSS to evaluate swallowing progress%BE

System: The rehabilitation treatment plan provided is tailored to the patient’s specific condition as of May 16, 2023, based on the detailed medical record and functional assessments. The plan addresses the primary diagnoses of sarcopenic dysphagia and mild cognitive impairment, as well as the sequelae of the intracerebral hemorrhage, focusing on improving nutritional status, swallowing safety, muscle strength, mobility, and cognitive function. If you have additional details or specific modifications to consider, please let me know, and I can refine the plan accordingly.
