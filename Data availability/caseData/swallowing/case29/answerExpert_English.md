### 1. Rehabilitation Goals:
#### Short-term Goals:
Improve the patient's severe malnutrition status to establish a foundation for functional recovery. Enhance muscle strength and endurance of swallowing-related muscle groups and the whole body through targeted training. Improve swallowing function with emphasis on reducing food leakage and aspiration risk, while strengthening the cough reflex to enhance airway self-protection. The ultimate goal is to achieve partial safe oral intake and reduce dependence on nasogastric tube feeding.

#### Long-term Goals:
Gradually transition to complete oral intake, remove the gastric tube, and restore normal eating ability. Further enhance overall muscle strength, physical endurance, and cognitive function. Improve the patient's holistic functional status and quality of life, and prevent recurrence of sarcopenia and dysphagia.

### 2. Treatment Methods:
This case employs a multidisciplinary comprehensive rehabilitation strategy, prioritizing nutritional intervention before functional training. Specific methods are as follows:

**Nutrition Support Therapy:**  
Address severe malnutrition and reduced gastric capacity. Calculate daily caloric (~1450 kcal) and protein (45g) requirements based on ideal body weight. Initiate full enteral nutrition with high-energy-density homogenized diet (supplemented with Ensure powder) to deliver adequate nutrition in small volumes, accommodating limited gastric capacity and reflux tendency. Administer gut microbiota modulators and prokinetic agents to enhance digestion/absorption. Combine physiotherapy (intermediate frequency electrotherapy to improve gastrointestinal motility) and acupuncture (at Tianshu (ST25), Zhongwan (CV12), Zusanli (ST36)) to synergistically improve digestive function.

**Swallowing Function Training:**  
A systematic, multi-level program to restore swallowing safety and efficiency.  
*   **Postural and Sensory Training:**  
    *   **Head/Neck Posture Control Training:** Active range-of-motion exercises to maintain/improve head control, targeting poor endurance and forward head posture.  
    *   **Oral Sensory Enhancement Training:** Integrate Deep Pharyngeal Neuromuscular Stimulation (DPNS), neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and handheld sensory electrical stimulation. Apply targeted stimulation to lips, cheeks, intrinsic/extrinsic tongue muscles, and soft palate to enhance pharyngeal sensation, promote pharyngeal reflex triggering, reduce swallow initiation delay, and prevent disuse atrophy.  

*   **Oral and Pharyngeal Motor/Strength Training:**  
    *   **Basic Motor Exercises:** Active/assisted lip closure, multidirectional tongue resistance exercises, isometric/isotonic training.  
    *   **Resistance Strength Training:**  
        *   **Chin Tuck Against Resistance (CTAR):** Patient sits upright, compresses an air-filled ball against the chin (30 repetitions OR 1-minute hold/1-minute rest Ã— 30 cycles). Perform 3 sets/day to strengthen suprahyoid muscles and increase pharyngeal pressure.  
        *   **Other Resistance Training:** Tongue resistance using tongue depressors, IOPI (Iowa Oral Performance Instrument), and EMG biofeedback; cheek muscle training via button pull exercises; masticatory muscle strength/endurance training with silicone chew tools of varying hardness; multidirectional tongue resistance using a tongue suction retractor.  
    *   **Functional Movement Training:**  
        *   **Masako Maneuver:** Enhance pharyngeal constrictor contraction.  
        *   **Volitional "Ah" Phonation:** Improve soft palate elevation.  
        *   **Tongue Pressure Feedback Training:** Utilize water-filled bulbs with visual feedback for strength/endurance training by adjusting bulb size/position.  

*   **Airway Protection Training:**  
    *   **Supraglottic Swallow Technique:** Train patient to voluntarily close the airway during swallowing to reduce leakage/aspiration.  

**Physical Endurance Training:**  
Address whole-body sarcopenia concurrently with dysphagia rehabilitation.  
*   **Core and Postural Training:** Relaxation, stretching, and resistance exercises targeting impaired head/neck control.  
*   **Whole-Body Training:** Utilize suspension training systems (e.g., Redcord Neurac) to improve overall physical strength and endurance.  

**Cognitive Rehabilitation:**  
Address cognitive impairment impacting swallowing via pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.  
*   **Pharmacotherapy:** Administer Memantine, Levodopa/Benserazide, and Idebenone for cognitive enhancement.  
*   **Rehabilitation Training:** Implement exercise therapy, specific cognitive training, dual-task training, and neuromodulation techniques including repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.  

**Specialized Nursing and Extended Training:**  
*   **Ward-Based Extended Training:** Nurses supervise swallowing organ sensory/motor exercises in the ward.  
*   **Oral Hygiene Management:** Perform daily oral care using negative-pressure suction toothbrushes and antimicrobial mouthwash to reduce oral infection and aspiration pneumonia risk.  
*   **Diet Monitoring and Education:** Require patients/families to maintain daily dietary records with submissions in the departmental nutrition group. The rehabilitation team adjusts protocols based on records and periodic nutritional assessments. Conduct fall prevention safety education for patients/families.
