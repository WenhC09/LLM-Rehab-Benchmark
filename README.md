### Benchmarking Large Language Models against Human Experts in Rehabilitation Medicine

This repository contains the full dataset for the paper: **"Benchmarking Large Language Models against Human Experts in Rehabilitation Medicine: A Multidimensional Evaluation."**

Our study addresses the growing gap between the demand for rehabilitation services and the shortage of specialized clinicians. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, their evaluation in clinical settings has been limited. To fill this gap, we conducted a rigorous, blinded comparison between five state-of-the-art LLMs and senior human physiatrists in the core task of formulating rehabilitation plans.

#### About the Study

The evaluation was performed on **48 authentic, complex clinical cases** spanning six major rehabilitation subspecialties. We benchmarked five leading LLMs against the "gold standard" of human expert-authored plans.

- **LLMs Evaluated:** Grok-4, Gemini-2.5-pro, ChatGPT-5, Deepseek-r1-0528, and Claude-opus-4-20250514.
- **Evaluation Framework:** A multi-dimensional framework was co-designed with clinical experts to assess plans across four key dimensions:
    1.  Clinical Applicability and Safety (C&S)
    2.  Scientific Rigor and Evidence-Based Conformity (S&E)
    3.  Individualization and Clinical Problem-Solving (I&C)
    4.  Clarity and Logicality (C&L)
- **Validation:** All assessments were cross-validated in both Chinese and English to ensure robustness.

#### Key Findings

1.  **Quantitative Analysis:** Top-performing LLMs (notably Grok-4) significantly **outperformed human experts** across all quantitative dimensions. AI-generated plans demonstrated superior consistency, comprehensiveness, and evidence-based rigor.
2.  **Qualitative Analysis:** Despite lower scores, human experts demonstrated **irreplaceable strengths** in strategic thinking, humanistic care, technology integration, and profound clinical insight. Humans act as "medical strategists," whereas LLMs function as highly efficient "treatment executors."
3.  **Proposed Paradigm:** We propose a new model of **Human-AI Collaboration**. LLMs can serve as powerful assistive tools to generate comprehensive, evidence-based draft plans, liberating human experts to focus on higher-level strategic optimization and nuanced, humanistic patient care.

#### Dataset Content

This repository provides open access to:

- The **48 authentic clinical cases** used in the evaluation (bilingual: Chinese and English).
- A total of **288 unique rehabilitation plans**, including those generated by each of the 5 LLMs and the original human expert for every case.
- The complete, anonymized **expert evaluation scores** for all 288 plans across all dimensions.

We hope this dataset will facilitate further research in clinical AI, human-AI collaboration, and the development of more effective and accessible rehabilitation healthcare solutions.
